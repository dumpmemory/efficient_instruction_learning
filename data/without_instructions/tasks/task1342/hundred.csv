Comes with a stand, but I put it in a drawer and never use it because of the extra bulk and weight. Do not miss it al all.

I also love that it came with a big bumper case to help protect the product. Orange is fun, and super gender neutral. The only reason this product received 4 stars from me is because it lags a bit. Playing games such as Temple Run is a bit harder on this device than it is on our iPad; however, this is a great product for a child. Definetly don't regret buying!

"input: It's a nice device to carry a lot of video and music files to play on your mobile device without running out of memory on your mobile device. The only negative I find is while creating Playlist on it (You can only create playlists on this device as it will not copy your playlists from iTunes). To create a playlist it opens up a list of all your songs in alphabetical order without any quick way to jump to a particular song. You have to scroll down each time you add a song to the list. No option to choose Album or Artist or anything else, only an alphabetical list of songs.

"input: This compact laptop packs one hell of a punch. Though I am still getting used to Windows 8, I use this computer for everything. It is replacing my 15.6 inch Gateway laptop. The touchscreen is a plus. For me 2GB of RAM is sufficient so far, and there is plenty of room for storage on the 320GB hard drive. I must say I am impressed with this laptop so far and would definitely recommend to a friend. I am glad my husband convinced me to jump on the Gateway wagon!!!<br /><br />UPDATE 3 Weeks Later<br />I was really was really enjoying this laptop until it conked out on me. I went to log on and after I entered my password, the screen would turn blue and stay that way. I tried rebooting it, recharging it, and I even took the battery out, all to no avail. Hence, I returned it today and reduce my rating from five stars to one star. I should have known not to purchase the first release of an item since the manufacturer probably has more kinks to work out. Hope this helps.

"input: Obviously, with a 5 star rating, I like this Kindle.    Here are my personal favorite features:    1) Prime TV Show/Movie Downloads - With a Prime Subscription, I can not only stream shows, but also DOWNLOAD shows to watch offline.  This is really great, especially when you're in spots with no wifi (like a bus stop, or plane, etc.)  The interface to manage shows is much better than the Prime website itself.    2) Sound - Wow!!! Sound is amazing when watching TV Shows or Movies.  Much better than an iPad.    3) Automatic App Updates - This was recently something added to iPads as well, but it's a great feature.  One less management task I have to do!    And here are a couple of my least favorite things:    1) Above anything else, the charging adapter....what where they thinking?  The USB port sticks out at an odd angle, making it difficult to plug in.  It's just very odd and makes charging annoying.    2) The battery life is ok, but not as good as my larger iPad by far.  What is sucking up so much battery?      Update - After a recent update to the Kindle OS, the battery life is MUCH better.

"input: Built products are put together well and use quality materials, which you'd expect because they're expensive.  But this bag has problems that make it less than ideal.<br /><br />I bought this to be a minimal bag, small, slim, and sleek.  But it's wider than it needs to be.  The straps attach in a way that flairs out of the top of the bag, making it wider than needed.  It also makes the bag an odd trapezoid shape.<br /><br />The second problem is, it's too tight. If your MacBook Air has a slim plastic case (like a Speck case).  A Speck case is very thin, yet its little extra size makes it very difficult to get the computer into and out of the Built bag.<br /><br />Another problem is the bag flap. It's too long.  It adds weight. It makes the bag harder to open and close.  If you put a computer power cord in the bag's front pockets, then the long flap won't stick and the flap sticks out unattractively.<br /><br />For me, this bag wasn't worth the high price.

"input: I was afraid it was a bad case because of the reviews. But I was surprised. Case arrived in a week, and the back is good, hard plastic. The front is soft, but definitely not flimsy. It's flimsy only because it's foldable, like the picture. At first I couldn't get it to stand, but then I realized I folded it incorrectly and it stood up well. Magnet also keeps the folds together. The rilakkuma is cute and I really love this case! I've dropped my iPad a few times but the case hasn't broke. It's a very good case, because it's thin and light as well.

"input: The display image itself is very nice with very sharp images and vibrant colors. No complaints on the actual display (5 stars for the image). I use this monitor for work, and it is outstanding for viewing documents and web pages. I have not used it for gaming or watching movies, so I can't comment on the image quality for those uses. I really like the fact that this monitor uses a scant 27 W.    The display's physical housing however, is a major disappointment (1 star for the housing):   - The display is wobbly on the base.   - The tilt adjustment is super stiff. It takes 2 hands and more force than I'd like to apply to the wobbly base to adjust the tilt (one hand to hold the base and one hand to hold the bezel).   - The bezel and base are gloss black, so they show every single fingerprint and smudge. Samsung seems to be aware of this issue because they included a cleaning cloth with the monitor that is NOT for the display area, but for the bezel and base! Hey Samsung, skip the cleaning cloth and use a finish that does not highlight every fingerprint and smudge! Another downside of a gloss black bezel is that it reflects light from adjacent light fixtures and windows, which I find to be a distraction. I have half a mind to get out some 400 grit sand paper and take care of the gloss finish once and for all.  - The base is some stylish post modern curved design that cannot be used to put anything on (e.g. won't hold a pen, a note pad, a paperclip, or my reading glasses), and is therefore a useless waste of my desk space.   - The touch controls on the lower right side are exactly where I grab the monitor to adjust its position. Every time I do this, I accidently shut the monitor off or activate some on-screen adjustment. I prefer buttons in the lower middle to avoid this issue and show deference to our left-handed friends.  - There are no VESA mounts on the back (in case that matters to you).    Finally, the power cord includes a power converter brick in the middle ofthe cord, which is an inconvenience.    So, I love the display image and hate the housing on this monitor, resulting in 3 stars overall. If my complaints about the housing are not things that would bother you, go for it. If you prefer a housing with a stable and useful base, an easy tilt adjustment, a non-reflective bezel, and/or VESA mounts then you should pick a different monitor.

"input: I love my HP 17&#34; Pavilion laptop, it is a workhorse and travels everywhere with me, but as things do the OEM battery finally stopped taking a charge and I had to find a replacement for an &#34;obsolete&#34; part.  I replaced the original 8 cell battery with this 12 cell, and it has been a perfect match!  I followed the instructions for charging and completely depleting the battery a few times and it has taken and held a 100% charge since.  With the additional cells the battery profile has added about 3/4&#34; to the bottom of my laptop.  This actually works out nicely because it raises the back of the laptop slightly and makes the angle of the keyboard more comfortable (for me) to type on and gives a little more airflow for the fan to ventilate the unit.  The price point for this battery was a significant bonus, as the the HP version (if you can find one) is upwards of $70.  All things considered, this was the right purchase for me, and if I'm still using this laptop when this battery wears out, I would purchase again.

"input: There's a lot to like about this case in terms of its aesthetics and overall design.  I should start by saying I haven't personally experienced this issues some customers have reported with the Kindle coming free of the case.  The Kindle and case secure to each other magnetically and, at least on the one I got, it's a secure fit.  I also haven't dropped my Kindle, so I can't speak to how well the case would protect the device in a fall, althogh it seems like it would probably be adequate in most cases.<br /><br />Some things I like about the case (in addition to the previously mentioned aesthetics) are the loop for a stylus, and the clever folding back that allows the Kindle to stand either horizontally for media viewing or vertically for reading.  I also like the way the Kindle keyboard fits into the case completing the set.  BUT...<br /><br />The devil's in the details, and some of the details end up being problematic.  The folding stand can't be used whiile the keyboard is in place, which isn't a huge deal, but might be a consideration for some customers.  A larger issue (which I also mentioned in my review of the keyboard itself) is the way in which the keyboard attaches to the case.  In order for the keyboard to magetically lock to the case, it is placed with the keys facing OUT, away from the case.  So, if you're using your Kindle as a reading device, or holding it on a plane, for example, and you have the keyboard attached, the case is folded open in such a way that your fingers are constantly pushing keys on the keyboard.  Naturally, this wakes the keyboard and can cause all sorts of problems.  Since the keyboard can't easily be used while it is in the case  anyway, it's too bad they didn't make it mount (or at least ABLE to mount in a position that would leave the keys inaccessible when it is mounted.<br /><br />That issue asiide, the case looks good, works well and has been a good companion to my Kindle.

The slimshell case is actually quite nice, slick and smooth, with a cloth-like material facing the screen.

Despite some reviews this case CAN be a stand in PORTRAIT and LANDSCAPE. For landscape you merely &#34;pinch&#34; the cover inwards. For portrait you &#34;pinch&#34; the cover outwards. I wanted to say the portrait stand was wobbly, but I smacked the kindle around while in portrait and it handled it like some sumo-gyroscope hybrid thus 5 stars.

The pen glides easily on the tablet; however, sometimes the tablet senses the pen too easily/soon, so I end up with unwanted nodes/lines when I'm just trying to carefully place the pen slowly to the tablet surface. I don't care much for the buttons on the pen, but I know that it can be more practical to use them. It bothers me when I grasp the pen and accidentally touch one of the buttons. Right now I use mainly the keyboard features (to delete, clear a node, etc.) until I feel comfortable enough to use the pen buttons. Overall, this is a nice tool for digital art.

"input: Bought two of them. One stopped being recognized after about 8 months (powers Dell laptop but not recognized so doesn't charge battery). Got my full money back since it was still under warranty.<br /><br />I believe the problem is in the third (innermost) wire inside the plug that sends the digital signal ID telling the DELL laptop that the charger is valid. Either their is a break somewhere in the wire or the chip that generates the ID inside the adapter is fried. The problem is mostly DELL's fault for requiring an ID to charge which is more about increasing the sales of DELL-branded adapters than providing any type of added (protection).<br /><br />So while I blame the adapter manufacturer in part for making a cheap adapter (but hey I only paid about 6.50), I blame Dell just as much for their anti-competitive tricks.

"input: I haven't had the drive long enough to write a proper review but I felt I could help by clearing some things up.  #1, this drive does NOT have a power button on it.  To the person who says it does, did you actually look in the manual and/or push the button?  It's not power, it's the Maxtor One Touch button.  Maybe you have a different model.<br />And to the person who claimed that the drive isn't USB 2.0, I'm sorry but that's completely wrong.  The drive is 2.0 and backwards compatible to 1.x.  To get 2.0 performance you need a USB 2.0 port in your computer!!!  They put an asterisk on the box to inform you that if you have 1.1 and want to ugprade to 2.0 they have a card (PCI USB 2.0) they will sell you.  I'm sure it was frustrating for you to discover that your PC only had a 1.x USB port and you needed to buy something additional.  But a good portion (I would say most) of folks know that to get USB 2.0 speed you need to have a USB 2.0 port.  If a company sells you a UDMA 133 IDE drive and you're on UDMA 66 or 100 you're going to get reduced speed until you upgrade your IDE.  The person said they replaced it with a Western Digital Drive, but unless that box came with a USB 2.0 PCI card included the results would have been the same.<br />I've had the drive 1 week so far it seems good and the transfer speed at USB 2.0 is good.

However, I mainly got a case like this so I could prop it up in the kitchen & follow recipes.

If I prop it up it sometimes slips, and it definitely slips if I have it propped up & am using it w/ the stylus or my finger. Otherwise, I can deal with it at the lower angle most of the time...and like I said, when closed it offers good protection for everyday moving around / throwing in my purse, backpack, breifcase, etc. I like the color, and the stylus slides nicely on the outside at the fold...overall decent deal for the price.
