Comes with a stand, but I put it in a drawer and never use it because of the extra bulk and weight. Do not miss it al all.

I also love that it came with a big bumper case to help protect the product. Orange is fun, and super gender neutral. The only reason this product received 4 stars from me is because it lags a bit. Playing games such as Temple Run is a bit harder on this device than it is on our iPad; however, this is a great product for a child. Definetly don't regret buying!

"input: It's a nice device to carry a lot of video and music files to play on your mobile device without running out of memory on your mobile device. The only negative I find is while creating Playlist on it (You can only create playlists on this device as it will not copy your playlists from iTunes). To create a playlist it opens up a list of all your songs in alphabetical order without any quick way to jump to a particular song. You have to scroll down each time you add a song to the list. No option to choose Album or Artist or anything else, only an alphabetical list of songs.

"input: This compact laptop packs one hell of a punch. Though I am still getting used to Windows 8, I use this computer for everything. It is replacing my 15.6 inch Gateway laptop. The touchscreen is a plus. For me 2GB of RAM is sufficient so far, and there is plenty of room for storage on the 320GB hard drive. I must say I am impressed with this laptop so far and would definitely recommend to a friend. I am glad my husband convinced me to jump on the Gateway wagon!!!<br /><br />UPDATE 3 Weeks Later<br />I was really was really enjoying this laptop until it conked out on me. I went to log on and after I entered my password, the screen would turn blue and stay that way. I tried rebooting it, recharging it, and I even took the battery out, all to no avail. Hence, I returned it today and reduce my rating from five stars to one star. I should have known not to purchase the first release of an item since the manufacturer probably has more kinks to work out. Hope this helps.

"input: Obviously, with a 5 star rating, I like this Kindle.    Here are my personal favorite features:    1) Prime TV Show/Movie Downloads - With a Prime Subscription, I can not only stream shows, but also DOWNLOAD shows to watch offline.  This is really great, especially when you're in spots with no wifi (like a bus stop, or plane, etc.)  The interface to manage shows is much better than the Prime website itself.    2) Sound - Wow!!! Sound is amazing when watching TV Shows or Movies.  Much better than an iPad.    3) Automatic App Updates - This was recently something added to iPads as well, but it's a great feature.  One less management task I have to do!    And here are a couple of my least favorite things:    1) Above anything else, the charging adapter....what where they thinking?  The USB port sticks out at an odd angle, making it difficult to plug in.  It's just very odd and makes charging annoying.    2) The battery life is ok, but not as good as my larger iPad by far.  What is sucking up so much battery?      Update - After a recent update to the Kindle OS, the battery life is MUCH better.

"input: Built products are put together well and use quality materials, which you'd expect because they're expensive.  But this bag has problems that make it less than ideal.<br /><br />I bought this to be a minimal bag, small, slim, and sleek.  But it's wider than it needs to be.  The straps attach in a way that flairs out of the top of the bag, making it wider than needed.  It also makes the bag an odd trapezoid shape.<br /><br />The second problem is, it's too tight. If your MacBook Air has a slim plastic case (like a Speck case).  A Speck case is very thin, yet its little extra size makes it very difficult to get the computer into and out of the Built bag.<br /><br />Another problem is the bag flap. It's too long.  It adds weight. It makes the bag harder to open and close.  If you put a computer power cord in the bag's front pockets, then the long flap won't stick and the flap sticks out unattractively.<br /><br />For me, this bag wasn't worth the high price.

"input: I was afraid it was a bad case because of the reviews. But I was surprised. Case arrived in a week, and the back is good, hard plastic. The front is soft, but definitely not flimsy. It's flimsy only because it's foldable, like the picture. At first I couldn't get it to stand, but then I realized I folded it incorrectly and it stood up well. Magnet also keeps the folds together. The rilakkuma is cute and I really love this case! I've dropped my iPad a few times but the case hasn't broke. It's a very good case, because it's thin and light as well.

"input: The display image itself is very nice with very sharp images and vibrant colors. No complaints on the actual display (5 stars for the image). I use this monitor for work, and it is outstanding for viewing documents and web pages. I have not used it for gaming or watching movies, so I can't comment on the image quality for those uses. I really like the fact that this monitor uses a scant 27 W.    The display's physical housing however, is a major disappointment (1 star for the housing):   - The display is wobbly on the base.   - The tilt adjustment is super stiff. It takes 2 hands and more force than I'd like to apply to the wobbly base to adjust the tilt (one hand to hold the base and one hand to hold the bezel).   - The bezel and base are gloss black, so they show every single fingerprint and smudge. Samsung seems to be aware of this issue because they included a cleaning cloth with the monitor that is NOT for the display area, but for the bezel and base! Hey Samsung, skip the cleaning cloth and use a finish that does not highlight every fingerprint and smudge! Another downside of a gloss black bezel is that it reflects light from adjacent light fixtures and windows, which I find to be a distraction. I have half a mind to get out some 400 grit sand paper and take care of the gloss finish once and for all.  - The base is some stylish post modern curved design that cannot be used to put anything on (e.g. won't hold a pen, a note pad, a paperclip, or my reading glasses), and is therefore a useless waste of my desk space.   - The touch controls on the lower right side are exactly where I grab the monitor to adjust its position. Every time I do this, I accidently shut the monitor off or activate some on-screen adjustment. I prefer buttons in the lower middle to avoid this issue and show deference to our left-handed friends.  - There are no VESA mounts on the back (in case that matters to you).    Finally, the power cord includes a power converter brick in the middle ofthe cord, which is an inconvenience.    So, I love the display image and hate the housing on this monitor, resulting in 3 stars overall. If my complaints about the housing are not things that would bother you, go for it. If you prefer a housing with a stable and useful base, an easy tilt adjustment, a non-reflective bezel, and/or VESA mounts then you should pick a different monitor.

"input: I love my HP 17&#34; Pavilion laptop, it is a workhorse and travels everywhere with me, but as things do the OEM battery finally stopped taking a charge and I had to find a replacement for an &#34;obsolete&#34; part.  I replaced the original 8 cell battery with this 12 cell, and it has been a perfect match!  I followed the instructions for charging and completely depleting the battery a few times and it has taken and held a 100% charge since.  With the additional cells the battery profile has added about 3/4&#34; to the bottom of my laptop.  This actually works out nicely because it raises the back of the laptop slightly and makes the angle of the keyboard more comfortable (for me) to type on and gives a little more airflow for the fan to ventilate the unit.  The price point for this battery was a significant bonus, as the the HP version (if you can find one) is upwards of $70.  All things considered, this was the right purchase for me, and if I'm still using this laptop when this battery wears out, I would purchase again.

"input: There's a lot to like about this case in terms of its aesthetics and overall design.  I should start by saying I haven't personally experienced this issues some customers have reported with the Kindle coming free of the case.  The Kindle and case secure to each other magnetically and, at least on the one I got, it's a secure fit.  I also haven't dropped my Kindle, so I can't speak to how well the case would protect the device in a fall, althogh it seems like it would probably be adequate in most cases.<br /><br />Some things I like about the case (in addition to the previously mentioned aesthetics) are the loop for a stylus, and the clever folding back that allows the Kindle to stand either horizontally for media viewing or vertically for reading.  I also like the way the Kindle keyboard fits into the case completing the set.  BUT...<br /><br />The devil's in the details, and some of the details end up being problematic.  The folding stand can't be used whiile the keyboard is in place, which isn't a huge deal, but might be a consideration for some customers.  A larger issue (which I also mentioned in my review of the keyboard itself) is the way in which the keyboard attaches to the case.  In order for the keyboard to magetically lock to the case, it is placed with the keys facing OUT, away from the case.  So, if you're using your Kindle as a reading device, or holding it on a plane, for example, and you have the keyboard attached, the case is folded open in such a way that your fingers are constantly pushing keys on the keyboard.  Naturally, this wakes the keyboard and can cause all sorts of problems.  Since the keyboard can't easily be used while it is in the case  anyway, it's too bad they didn't make it mount (or at least ABLE to mount in a position that would leave the keys inaccessible when it is mounted.<br /><br />That issue asiide, the case looks good, works well and has been a good companion to my Kindle.

The slimshell case is actually quite nice, slick and smooth, with a cloth-like material facing the screen.

Despite some reviews this case CAN be a stand in PORTRAIT and LANDSCAPE. For landscape you merely &#34;pinch&#34; the cover inwards. For portrait you &#34;pinch&#34; the cover outwards. I wanted to say the portrait stand was wobbly, but I smacked the kindle around while in portrait and it handled it like some sumo-gyroscope hybrid thus 5 stars.

The pen glides easily on the tablet; however, sometimes the tablet senses the pen too easily/soon, so I end up with unwanted nodes/lines when I'm just trying to carefully place the pen slowly to the tablet surface. I don't care much for the buttons on the pen, but I know that it can be more practical to use them. It bothers me when I grasp the pen and accidentally touch one of the buttons. Right now I use mainly the keyboard features (to delete, clear a node, etc.) until I feel comfortable enough to use the pen buttons. Overall, this is a nice tool for digital art.

"input: Bought two of them. One stopped being recognized after about 8 months (powers Dell laptop but not recognized so doesn't charge battery). Got my full money back since it was still under warranty.<br /><br />I believe the problem is in the third (innermost) wire inside the plug that sends the digital signal ID telling the DELL laptop that the charger is valid. Either their is a break somewhere in the wire or the chip that generates the ID inside the adapter is fried. The problem is mostly DELL's fault for requiring an ID to charge which is more about increasing the sales of DELL-branded adapters than providing any type of added (protection).<br /><br />So while I blame the adapter manufacturer in part for making a cheap adapter (but hey I only paid about 6.50), I blame Dell just as much for their anti-competitive tricks.

"input: I haven't had the drive long enough to write a proper review but I felt I could help by clearing some things up.  #1, this drive does NOT have a power button on it.  To the person who says it does, did you actually look in the manual and/or push the button?  It's not power, it's the Maxtor One Touch button.  Maybe you have a different model.<br />And to the person who claimed that the drive isn't USB 2.0, I'm sorry but that's completely wrong.  The drive is 2.0 and backwards compatible to 1.x.  To get 2.0 performance you need a USB 2.0 port in your computer!!!  They put an asterisk on the box to inform you that if you have 1.1 and want to ugprade to 2.0 they have a card (PCI USB 2.0) they will sell you.  I'm sure it was frustrating for you to discover that your PC only had a 1.x USB port and you needed to buy something additional.  But a good portion (I would say most) of folks know that to get USB 2.0 speed you need to have a USB 2.0 port.  If a company sells you a UDMA 133 IDE drive and you're on UDMA 66 or 100 you're going to get reduced speed until you upgrade your IDE.  The person said they replaced it with a Western Digital Drive, but unless that box came with a USB 2.0 PCI card included the results would have been the same.<br />I've had the drive 1 week so far it seems good and the transfer speed at USB 2.0 is good.

However, I mainly got a case like this so I could prop it up in the kitchen & follow recipes.

If I prop it up it sometimes slips, and it definitely slips if I have it propped up & am using it w/ the stylus or my finger. Otherwise, I can deal with it at the lower angle most of the time...and like I said, when closed it offers good protection for everyday moving around / throwing in my purse, backpack, breifcase, etc. I like the color, and the stylus slides nicely on the outside at the fold...overall decent deal for the price.

The unit will even charge while my Nexus 7 is still in its MoKo Google New Nexus 7 FHD 2nd Gen Case.<br /><br />One of the things that I think is great, is that using this unit will help keep the wear and tear on the micro usb plug down by eliminating the need to plug in th charging cord to charge every day.  I also have the 2012 Nexus 7 and the power/usb port is getting a tad sloppy from the need to charge it every day for the last year of use. Unfortunately the original Nexus 7 can not use this wireless charger but it will help prevent my new one from suffering the same wear and tear on the usb/charger port.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

Since I often travel with my laptop, I wanted something to replace my bulky laptop bag, but also something that would protect my computer, rather than just having it bounce around inside my packpack.  This laptop sleeve was just the thing.  It fits my 15.6\\"" Dell perfectly and has a slim profile.  I find it fits into my Maxpedition Kodiak Gearslinger, and is easy to extract when going through a security check point at airports.  For under $20.00, it's a good solution for anybody trying to cut down on their baggage articles without compromising the physical security of their laptop.

"input: I purchased this drive to keep a backup of my Aperture library while I am on scuba vacations. I would hate to lose my MacBook Pro AND all my photos from the trip so this is extra insurance to have a copy of everything. The drive is fairly compact however there are some portable drives out there that are smaller if you need something really compact. Included is a nice rubber cover that will protect the drive from drops but it does take away some of the portability factor. There are three included cables so you won't need anything extra to get going.<br />I plugged the drive in via the Firewire 800 and waited for it to mount. It took about 15 seconds to mount and then was ready to go. It is bus powered so it does not require any separate power supply, just plug into your computer and let the drive mount to use. I began copying some files to test the drive. It was very fast and worked just as promised, preformatted for the Mac and ready to go. I will report back on speed and longer term performance as I use the drive more but so far it is a worthy purchase.

Price being a motivating factor attracted me to this unit and it has not disappointed.  The keyboard has a nice feel, keystrokes are smooth and quiet.

"input: I just received the TP-Link AC 1200 Dual Band Wireless Router nicely packaged from Amazon.  I opened the box, laid out all the gear inside, and began the process of installing the router.<br /><br />Other reviewers have mentioned how easy it is to set up this router and they are correct for those people who are replacing an existing router with the new TP-Link reviewed here.  For those folks new to using a router, TP-Link makes your task easy by providing you with a Resource CD which takes you step by step through the installation process.<br /><br />Even though I have a router already in place, I decided to use the CD just to be sure that I got the maximum benefit from this new router.  I was pleased with the systematic and clear directions given on the installation Wizard.  In about ten minutes or less the Wizard told me installation was complete.<br /><br />Now to test the router, which is located in a third floor office in my home.  I went down to the first floor and turned on a HP Laptop with a Windows 7 operating system.  After initializing the computer to accept the new router, I opened Google first and then AOL.  Both browsers opened quickly, not quite as fast as the desktop computer that I am using to write this review, but fast nonetheless.  Good start.<br /><br />I decided to first bring up a video from YouTube - John Denver playing \\""The Bells of Rhymney.\\""  Perfect picture and excellent sound.  Next I went to NetFlix and clicked on \\""Grand Hotel,\\"" a new Spanish film.  Again, excellent picture quality and sound.  The TP-Link works just as advertised.<br /><br />What about customer service?  Often it is difficult or impossible to get anyone on the phone to help if difficulty with new equipment is encountered.  Not so with TP-Link.  I was quickly connected to a tech adviser who talked to me about various features of this router.  He was competent and friendly.  I decided that if I ran into any problems with the router, help would be easily available.<br /><br />Bottom line.  Fast and easy to install, the TP-Link AC 1200 Dual Band Wireless Router works as advertised.  How will it hold up over time?  I will come back and update this review in a couple of months to discuss reliability issues with Amazon readers./>Bottom line.

"input: This kit consists of an indoor camera/transmitter, a USB receiver for your PC and software. I'm a PC expert, but a security system novice. Here are my observations:<br /><br />Setup:<br /><br />Setup requires the following steps:<br />1) Find a place to mount the indoor camera. It must be within 10 feet of a power outlet, no exceptions. Mount the camera, plug it in the wall.<br />2) Load the software on your PC. The PC must be running Windows XP (any variety) or Vista. The installation is relatively painless.<br />3) Plug the receiver module into the wall and connect the receiver to your PC via USB.<br /><br />Comments:<br /><br />A) The requirement that the camera be within 10 feet of a wall outlet will create issues for some. It certainly did for me: There was no convenient outlet near the front door, which is where I would have preferred to mount the camera. (Remember that even if you have a convenient outlet, the cord is only 10 feet long, and you may not want the cord draped along the floor or whatever). As a result, I mounted the camera on the second floor to look down on the entryway porch--not my favorite choice, but good enough for now.<br />B) Because this system uses power-line ethernet (it uses the power lines in your home to do the networking), it is subject to the standard bugaboos of that approach, namely the connection can become flakey if you use certain appliances on your line (hair dryers are bad, for example), and the quality of the connection can also vary depending on where the transmitter and receiver are relative to the wiring.<br />C) The installation was relatively painless, but does require reboots and downloads to update the software.<br />D) You should plan for the PC to which you attach the receiver to be on 24/7, or at least at any time you want the camera system to work. If you expect to use this as a security monitoring system when you are gone, I would strongly recommend you put your PC on a good quality uninterruptable power supply (note that the receiver unit MUST be plugged directly into the wall, not the UPS, so if your power goes out, you will NOT get any camera feed until power is restored. But at least if your PC is on a UPS, transmission can start up again automatically when the power is restored).<br /><br />Use:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) I was surprised at the good quality image I was getting from the camera, given the inexpensive nature of this kit and the relatively low light in the area to which it was pointed. Thumbs up.<br />2) The control software is relative easy to use. Thumbs up.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) This kit promises you can view your camera's output remotely. To me, that was probably the coolest thing. You could be in another city and keep an eye on your home. HOWEVER, it turns out that the only thing you can do without spending more money is watch the camera real-time. You can adjust the camera, and you can't review the video that your camera has captured remotely without paying $80/year to unlock additional features. I hate hidden cost software unlocks that are required to obtain the full usefulness of a product. This, in my opinion, pushes this kit down a full star (at least) in usefulness.<br /><br />2) No sound. I am not sure why I expected this kit to capture sound, and I am not even sure if it matters, but it was disappointing to discover that the camera is video only. I consider this a minor nit.<br /><br />Overall, I found that this kit exceeded my expectations in terms of the quality of the video that it captures, but that the powerline networking (with the limitation of a 10 foot power cord for the camera) and the $80 unlocking fee before remote operation is useful considerably reduce my overall happiness with the device. If they were to introduce a camera that used standard 802.1g wireless networking (either battery operated or capable of using a longer power cord), that would considerably increase the usefulness of the camera. If they would also stop with the $80 fee and just include all the features with the package (even if the package was priced higher), that could address the second issue.hat could address the second issue.

I want to use it for presentations and I don't like carry my 15inch laptop to school just to open a word or excel file.<br />I did a long research over similar devices, like Miix, Venue, Acer W4 and I choose this one because of GPS and micro HDMI. And I am really glad I made this choice. It feels comfortable in my hands, it is noticeably heavier than Ipad Mini, but weight didnt bother so far.<br />One of issues is hearing a cracking sound (sometimes) when touching corner of screen which I don't like.<br />Battery is really good, performance is superb! and interestingly even for all old windows applications (not metro ones) I clicked with 100% accuracy on menus, buttons and everything.<br />Because I needed to demo some of my applications written in OpenGL, I searched internet and some websites say it has Open GL ES, but it actually support OpenGL up to ver 4.0. And interestingly I could run Skyrim on it, with low setting really good!<br /><br />Update 2:<br />Good news! You can make screen mirroring (either via hdmi or miracast) with installing newest intel drivers. Unfortunatly toshiba did not as of now provide them. But oyu can grab them from dell venue 8 pro website (.exe file called Intel Platform Driver Installer , version 12/2/2013) and extract content of .exe file, then with have disk method update graphics driver from .inf file located at \GFX directory.<br />Although you have to change resoulutions from intel graphics options.<br /><br />Update 1:<br />I havent heard that cracking sound anymore. Maybe it just takes time to fix itself.<br />Also If you are having trouble with connecting your mobile phone to device with bluetooh (which I had with my Galaxy S4) try searching for<br />\\""iogear bluetooth driver 12.0.0.8030\\"" it is actually lat4est version  of broadcam bluetooth I could find. Which added many more profiles to bluetooth stack.

"input: Having a Cf USB 2.0 card reader made life much more simpler than transfering images via the Camera.  There are 2 big advantages in buying one.  1) It is powered by your Computer via a USB cable and does not require you to upload via your camera, so you can save your camera's batteries.  2) It transfers images from the CF to the PC at a significantly faster rate than the camera. Without keeping track of time I would say it is 2/3 rds quicker with a CF reader than using a conventional usb transfer via the camera.  My only regret is that I did not buy this product sooner.
output: ",Works like a charm. Super fast image transfer

"input: I purchased this as a gift for my brother and his wife.  The purpose was for them to be able to back up their pictures of their new born child.  They were just storing all of their pictures on a desktop and the camera memory cards.<br /><br />I suggested that they follow the same routine that I do with all of my pictures.  They can save the pictures to their computer and then organize them by year then month.  Every couple of weeks they plug this drive in a back up their pictures.  While they are not using this drive they should keep it unplugged from their computer and in their safe.  (Another tip I gave them was that every year they should buy a USB thumb drive and save the previous calendar year to it as well).<br /><br />Using this drive in this fashion does not take advantage of any of the software features that it comes with nor does it touch on the life expectancy of it.  What it does though is allow for you to back up a ton of priceless pictures that would be devastating to lose.<br /><br />For us, the cost is great for what you get.  I have used many WD Passports and have never had a problem.<br /><br />-One tip that I will offer and you can take it if you wish...  I would not leave this (or any) USB drive plugged into your computer all of the time.  When you are not using the data that is on it it is best unplug it.  These drives have moving parts in them and the more they are used the more wear they take on.  Doing this will prolong their life.
output: ",great for backup (if you don't leave it plugged in all of the time)

"input: I would probably give this negative stars if I could. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and it worked for a month or so then it would come on and only have a black screen. Thank God I bought the square trade protection plan since there is no way to contact Zeepad or any affiliates. I tried for along time to get a number to call, an email, anything, but no apparently there isnt a way to contact Zeepad. If I cant contact them at all, what does that tell you about how they stand behand there product. Dont waste your time or money.

"input: This is my first venture into NAS.  I'd have to say I'm pretty satisfied with it.<br /><br />I can't say it is without flaws.  I've had it for a few months, and it has frozen twice while trying to shut it down.<br /><br />That being said, it is pretty easy to set up.  I'm only running it with 2 drives at the moment but I wanted room to grow.<br /><br />I paid $209 for it directly from Amazon.  Why it's now a higher price, I can't say.  I guess I got it at a good time.

"input: Added hours and hours to my FiOS DVRs recording capability. I have so many shows recorded now it's outrageous and gives me the freedom to record shows without having to worry about space or deleting something.<br /><br />I tried using an external ESATA box I had laying around with a hard drive, and it worked for a while, but even after trying two drives, they would eventually failed after a couple months causing the UI to stutter and pause and make even going to the guide almost impossible- and playback was a slideshow. So now, after months later of 24/7 use, I can say this recommended solution of the MyBook DVR Expander has been flawless and there have been zero problems. I don't know if these DVR's require a special firmware on the drives or if I just had really bad luck with two drives go bad right after the other, but I do know using this DVR expander has given me zero trouble and works just as advertised - plug and play. Highly recommended.
output: ",Highly recommended - Rolling your own DVR expansion isn't worth it
"input: Setup was fine, after less than three month of use and it was probably turned on ten times the drive has stopped working. Now I have to return the drive to Amazon. Great,
output: ",Terrible
