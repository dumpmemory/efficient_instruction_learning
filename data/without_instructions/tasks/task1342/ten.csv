"input: LOVE this case!  Have one for my phone and wanted to replace what I was using on my iPad.  So glad I did.  Love that my screen is protected and all the ports are covered.  Comes with a stand, but I put it in a drawer and never use it because of the extra bulk and weight. Do not miss it al all.  I put this in my Amazon cart and waited for the price to come down before purchasing. Got it for $48. Can't imagine anyone not liking this case!
