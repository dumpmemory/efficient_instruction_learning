The restrictions to be abolished shall include in particular those arising out of measures which prevent or limit the establishment of beneficiaries by the following means:(a) In Germany:the provisions granting the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs the discretionary right to impose its own conditions of access to this business on foreign nationals and to prevent them from pursuing this business within the Federal Republic (Law of 6 June 1931 (VAG), Article 106 (2), No 1, in conjunction with Article 8 (1), No 3, Article 106 (2), last sentence, and Article 111 (2));(b) In Belgium:the obligation to hold a 'carte professionelle' (Article 1 of the Law of 19 February 1965);(c) In France:- the need to obtain special consent (Law of 15 February 1917, as amended and supplemented by the 'décret-loi' of 30 October 1935, Article 2 (2) — 'décret' of 19 August 1941, as amended, Articles 1 and 2 — 'décret' of 13 August 1947, as amended, Articles 2 and 10);- the obligation to provide a surety-bond or special guarantees as a reciprocal requirement (Law of 15 February 1917, amended and supplemented by the 'décret-loi' of 30 October 1935, Article 2 (2) — 'décret-loi' of 14 June 1938, Article 42 — 'décret' of 30 December 1938, as amended, Article 143 — 'décret' of 14 December 1966, Articles 9, 10 and 11);- the obligation to deposit technical reserves ('décret' of 30 December 1938, amended Article 179 — 'décret' of 13 August 1947, as amended, Articles 8 and 13 — 'décret' of 14 December 1966, Title I).(d) In Ireland:the provision that, to be eligible for an insurance licence, a company must be registered under the Irish Companies Acts, two-thirds of its shares must be owned by Irish citizens and the majority of the directors (other than a full-time managing director) must be Irish citizens (Insurance Act, 1936, Section 12; Insurance Act, 1964, Section 7).3.
