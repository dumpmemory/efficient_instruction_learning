(5) OJ No 194, 27.11.1964, p. 3243/64  Article 2For the purpose of this Directive, a film shall be regarded as having the nationality of one or more Member States where it satisfies the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 of the first Directive concerning the film industry, adopted by the Council on 15 October 1963. Article 1 (a) shall not apply in Member States in which films are usually shown in the language of their country of origin. The opening of a specialist cinema in a Member State shall not entitle any other Member State to grant any direct or indirect aid, whether financial or other, which would have the effect of distorting the conditions of establishment.In particular, no such aid shall be granted for:  - the construction, reconstruction or modernisation of any cinema;- the execution of work in connection with safety, hygiene or technical improvements;- the purchasing of equipment;- the renting of full-length films;- the covering of risks or trading losses.Any and every kind of aid available in the Member State in question for the opening of a specialist cinema shall be available without discrimination to operators who are nationals of other Member States of the Community.Beneficiaries from Member States shall in no instance be treated less favourably than natural persons or companies or firms from third countries. A Member State which, on the day of notification of this Directive, requires cinemas to set aside a minimum number of days per calendar year for the exhibition of domestic films (screen quota) shall, by 31 December 1966 at the latest, allow films having the nationality of one or more Member States to be included in the quota under the same conditions as those applicable to domestic films. That Member State may increase the number of days comprising its screen quota so as to allow for the inclusion of films from other countries.Member States which, on the day of notification of this Directive, do not impose screen quotas, may introduce such quotas provided that they are also applicable to films having the nationality of other Member States.Screen quotas shall not be applied to the specialist cinemas referred to in Article 1 (a). The Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission and at the request of a Member State, may, by a qualified majority, authorise that State to impose limits on the exhibition, whether in specialist or in non-specialist cinemas, of foreign films in the language of their country of origin where such language is that of the region in which the cinema is situated. Import quotas for films having the nationality of one or more Member States shall be abolished by 31 December 1966 at the latest.The Federal Republic of Germany shall, however, during the transitional period, retain the power to limit the importation of films having the nationalty of one or more Member States and in respect of which the national censorship authority has granted a certificate more than four years before the date on which the application to import is submitted to the competent authorities.Abolition of import quotas gives the right to import prints, dupes an advertising material without restriction. Provisions requiring that the dubbing of films must take place in the importing country shall, by 31 December 1966 at the latest, be repealed in respect of films having the nationality of one or more Member States. Member States shall adopt the measures necessary to comply with this Directive within six months of its notification and shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof. 0This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

Without prejudice to the application of Council Regulation No 17 and in accordance with Article 85 (3) of the Treaty the Commission may by regulation declare that Article 85 (1) shall not apply to categories of agreements to which only two undertakings are party and:  (a)  - whereby one party agrees with the other to supply only to that other certain goods for resale within a defined area of the common market ; or- whereby one party agrees with the other to purchase only from that other certain goods for resale ; or- whereby the two undertakings have entered into obligations, as in the two preceding subparagraphs, with each other in respect of exclusive supply and purchase for resale;(b) which include restrictions imposed in relation to the acquisition or use of industrial property rights-in particular of patents, utility models, designs or trade marks-or to the rights arising out of contracts for assignment of, or the right to use, a method of manufacture or knowledge relating to the use or to the application of industrial processes.2. The regulation shall define the categories of agreements to which it applies and shall specify in particular:  (a) the restrictions or clauses which must not be contained in the agreements;(b) the clauses which must be contained in the agreements, or the other conditions which must be satisfied.3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply by analogy to categories of concerted practices to which only two undertakings are party. 1. A regulation pursuant to Article 1 shall be made for a specified period.2. It may be repealed or amended where circumstances have changed with respect to any factor which was basic to its being made ; in such case, a period shall be fixed for modification of the agreements and concerted practices to which the earlier regulation applies. A regulation pursuant to Article 1 may stipulate that it shall apply with retroactive effect to agreements and concerted practices to which, at the date of entry into force of that regulation, a decision issued with retroactive effect in pursuance of Article 6 of Regulation No 17 would have applied. 1. A regulation pursuant to Article 1 may stipulate that the prohibition contained in Article 85 (1) of the Treaty shall not apply, for such period as shall be fixed by that regulation, to agreements and concerted practices already in existence on 13 March 1962 which do not satisfy the conditions of Article 85 (3), where: - within three months from the entry into force of the Regulation, they are so modified as to satisfy the said conditions in accordance with the provisions of the regulation ; and- the modifications are brought to the notice of the Commission within the time limit fixed by the regulation.2. Paragraph 1 shall apply to agreements and concerted practices which had to be notified before 1 February 1963, in accordance with Article 5 of Regulation No 17, only where they have been so notified before that date.3. The benefit of the provisions laid down pursuant to paragraph 1 may not be claimed in actions pending at the date of entry into force of a regulation adopted pursuant to Article 1 ; neither may it be relied on as grounds for claims for damages against third parties. Before adopting a regulation, the Commission shall publish a draft thereof and invite all persons concerned to submit their comments within such time limit, being not less than one month, as the Commission shall fix. 1. The Commission shall consult the Adivsory Committee on Restrictive Practices and Monopolies: (a) before publishing a draft regulation;(b) before adopting a regulation.2. Article 10 (5) and (6) of Regulation No 17, relating to consultation with the Advisory Committee, shall apply by analogy, it being understood that joint meetings with the Commission shall take place not earlier than one month after dispatch of the notice convening them. Where the Commission, either on its own initiative or at the request of a Member State or of natural or legal persons claiming a legitimate interest, finds that in any particular case agreements or concerted practices to which a regulation adopted pursuant to Article 1 of this Regulation applies have nevertheless certain effects which are incompatible with the conditions laid down in Article 85 (3) of the Treaty, it may withdraw the benefit of application of that regulation and issue a decision in accordance with Articles 6 and 8 of Regulation No 17, without any notification under Article 4 (1) of Regulation No 17 being required. The Commission shall, before 1 January 1970, submit to the Council a proposal for a Regulation for such amendment of this Regulation as may prove necessary in the light of experience.This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

Where the country of origin or the country whence the foreign national comes does not issue such documentary proof of no previous bankruptcy, such proof may be replaced by a declaration on oath made by the person concerned before a judicial or administrative authority, a notary, or a competent professional or trade body, in the country of origin or in the country whence that person comes.3. Documents issued in accordance with paragraph 1 or with paragraph 2 may not be produced more than three months after their date of issue.4.

Where, pursuant to Article 97 of the Treaty, a Member State introduces or alters an average rate in order to offset, with respect both to imports and to exports, the turnover tax which is directly or indirectly imposed on the manufacture of a product or group of products, that rate shall be calculated in  1OJ No C 10, 14.2.1968, p. 4. 2OJ No. 317, 28.12.1967, p. 9.accordance with the provisions of this Directive, in the light of the actual conditions of production.2. This Directive shall not apply to:    - average rates existing when this Directive enters into force, even if used for calculating previous tax burdens in accordance with the provisions of Article 6;- adaptations of the average rates arising solely from a general change of the rate of turnover tax. 1. The average tax burden on a product shall be equal to the weighted average of the tax burdens on that product at the different representative stages of production established for each stage in accordance with Articles 3 to 6. The weighted average shall be based on the importance of each stage in relation to the total production of the product.2. The average tax burden on a group of products shall be equal to the weighted average of the average tax burdens on representative products for that group. The size of the group of products shall determine the number of representative products to be taken into account. For each representative product the average tax burden shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1. The weighted average shall be based on the importance of the representative products in relation to the total production of the group of products. For purposes of calculating the tax burdens on a product at the final stage of production, the tax burdens on all factors in the cost price at that stage may be taken into account. 1. For purposes of calculating the tax burden on a product at the penultimate stage, account may be taken of the burdens imposed at that stage on those raw materials, semi-finished products and finished products which are used in raw materials, semi-finished products or finished products taken into account at the final stage, or in any other factor or component taken into account at the final stage, if it represents at that stage not less than 3 % of the selling price of the final product before tax.2. For purposes of calculating the tax burden on a product at the other stages, account may be taken of the burdens imposed at each of these stages on those raw materials, semi-finished products and finished products which are intended for the manufacture of a raw material, semi-finished product or finished product taken into account at the final stage. 1. If, for a factor or for a component taken into account at any stage, the tax burden at previous stages has not been calculated in accordance with Article 4, the bourden on that factor or that component may be increased at a standard rate of 50 %. If, however, the amount of the tax burden on that factor or that component is due to the application of a special rate, that amount must be recalculated before application of the standard rate, on the basis of the standard rate of turnover tax. Where that special rate covers one or more previous stages, the burden resulting from the application of that rate shall not be increased at a standard rate.2. The burden thus calculated for previous stages may not exceed that which would result from applying Articles 4 and 6 to that factor or component. If, for a factor or component taken into account at any stage, an average rate exists, that may be used for calculating the previous tax burden on that factor or that component where it is in accordance with Article 97. This rate shall be applied if it is supported by calculations submitted to the Commission in accordance with Article 10. 1. Where, in the case of a product or group of products, a Member State does not calculate the average tax burden in accordance with Articles 2 to 6, that burden may be estimated at a standard rate corresponding to 100 %, 75 %, 50 % or 30 % of the standard rate of turnover tax, according to whether the factors and components of the product or group of products which may be taken into account at the final stage and are liable to the standard rate or to the increased rate of turnover tax represent 65 %, 50 %, 35 % or less than 35 %, respectively, of the selling price of the product or group of products before tax.2. The burden thus estimated may not exceed the average tax burden which would result from applying Articles 2, 3, 4 and 6. The average rates shall be rounded to the next half point above or below according to whether the decimal fraction of the rate obtained reaches or does not reach 0 775 or 0 725. After consulting the Member States, the Commission shall, if necessary, lay down by directive the procedure for application of Articles 1 to 8. 01. Where a Member State intends to introduce or to alter an average rate, it shall submit to the Commission the calculations by which the average tax burden was established in accordance with Articles 1 to 8.2. Where the Commission considers that a tax burden established at a standard rate in accordance with Article 5 or 7 exceeds the limits set in paragraph 2 of those Articles, the Member State shall submit to the Commission, on request, the calculation by which that burden was established under Articles 2, 3, 4 and 6. 1Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they subsequently adopt in the field covered by this Directive.This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

As proof of the right of residence, a document entitled 'Residence Permit for a National of a Member State of the EEC' shall be issued. This document must include a statement that it has been issued pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 and to the measures taken by the Member States for the implementation of the present Directive. The text of such statement is given in the Annex to this Directive.3. For the issue of a Residence Permit for a National of a Member State of the EEC, Member States may require only the production of the following documents;  - by the worker:    (a) the document with which he entered their territory;(b) a confirmation of engagement from the employer or a certificate of employment;- by the members of the worker s family:    (c) the document with which they entered the territory;(d) a document issued by the competent authority of the State of origin or the State whence they came, proving their relationship;(e) in the cases referred to in Article 10 (1) and (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68, a document issued by the competent authority of the State of origin or the State whence they came, testifying that they are dependent on the worker or that they live under his roof in such country.4. A member of the family who is not a national of a Member State shall be issued with a residence document which shall have the same validity as that issued to the worker on whom he is dependent. Completion of the formalities for obtaining a residence permit shall not hinder the immediate beginning of employment under a contract concluded by the applicants. 1. The residence permit:    (a) must be valid throughout the territory of the Member State which issued it;(b) must be valid for at least five years from the date of issue and be automatically renewable.2. Breaks in residence not exceeding six consecutive months and absence on military service shall not affect the validity of a residence permit.3. Where a worker is employed for a period exceeding three months but not exceeding a year in the service of an employer in the host State or in the employ of a person providing services, the host Member State shall issue him a temporary residence permit, the validity of which may be limited to the expected period of the employment.Subject to the provisions of Article 8 (1) (c), a temporary residence permit shall be issued also to a seasonal worker employed for a period of more than three months. The period of employment must be shown in the documents referred to in paragraph 4 (3) (b). 1. A valid residence permit may not be withdrawn from a worker solely on the grounds that he is no longer in employment, either because he is temporarily incapable of work as a result of illness or accident, or because he is involuntarily unemployed, this being duly confirmed by the competent employment office.2. When the residence permit is renewed for the first time, the period of residence may be restricted, but not to less than twelve months, where the worker has been involuntarily unemployed in the Member State for more than twelve consecutive months. 1. Member States shall, without issuing a residence permit, recognise the right of residence in their territory of:   (a) a worker pursuing an activity as an employed person, where the activity is not expected to last for more than three months. The document with which the person concerned entered the territory and a statement by the employer on the expected duration of the employment shall be sufficient to cover his stay ; a statement by the employer shall not, however, be required in the case of workers coming within the provisions of the Council Directive of 25 February 19641 on the attainment of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services in respect of the activities of intermediaries in commerce, industry and small craft industries.(b) a worker who, while having his residence in the territory of a Member State to which he returns as a rule, each day or at least once a week, is employed in the territory of another Member State. The competent authority of the State where he is employed may issue such worker with a special permit valid for five years and automatically renewable;(c) a seasonal worker who holds a contract of employment stamped by the competent authority of the Member State on whose territory he has come to pursue his activity.2. In all cases referred to in paragraph 1, the competent authorities of the host Member State may require the worker to report his presence in the territory. 1. The residence documents granted to nationals of a Member State of the EEC referred to in this Directive shall be issued and renewed free of charge or on payment of an amount not exceeding the dues and taxes charged for the issue of identity cards to nationals.2. The visa referred to in Article 3 (2) and the stamp referred to in Article 8 (1) (c) shall be free of charge.3. Member States shall take the necessary steps to simplify as much as possible the formalities and procedure for obtaining the documents mentioned in paragraph 1. 0Member States shall not derogate from the provisions of this Directive save on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. 11. This Directive shall not affect the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community which relate to workers with recognised skills in coal mining and steel making, or the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community which deal with the right to take up skilled employment in the field of nuclear energy, or any measures taken in implementation of those Treaties.2. Nevertheless, this Directive shall apply to the categories of workers referred to in paragraph 1, and to members of their families, in so far as their legal position is not governed by the abovementioned Treaties or measures. 21. Member States shall, within nine months of notification of this Directive, bring into force the measures necessary to comply with its provisions and shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.2. They shall notify the Commission of amendments made to provisions imposed by law, regulation or administrative action for the simplification of the formalities and procedure for issuing such documents as are still necessary for the entry, exit and residence of workers and members of their families. 31.

Member States in which the taking up or pursuit of any activity referred to in Article 1 (2) is subject to possession of certain qualifications shall ensure that any beneficiary who applies therefor be provided, before he establishes himself or before he begins to pursue any activity on a temporary basis, with information as to the rules governing the occupation which he proposes to pursue. 1.

Tenders shall be considered only if a deposit is lodged.The deposit shall be forfeited in whole or in part if obligations are not fulfilled or are only partially fulfilled. 1. Implementation of the measures taken pursuant to Article 6 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 shall be ensured by the intervention agency of the Member State on the territory of which is located the cold storage depot where the butter or cream for which aid is granted will be stored.The intervention agency of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg shall, however, be authorised to conclude contracts for storing butter or cream on the territory of another Member State, provided that the supervision provided for in paragraph 9 (1) (f) is assured.2. Private storage aid shall be conditional on the conclusion of a storage contract with the intervention agency. Such contract shall be drawn up in accordance with provisions to be laid down.The intervention agency shall conclude a contract with any interested party capable of fulfilling the terms of the contract.3. The conclusion of the contract may be subject to the lodging of a deposit guaranteeing that, the storer will store the quantities shown in the contract within the time limit laid down. The deposit shall be forfeited in whole or in part if storage is not effected or is only partially effected within such time.4. Until the date on which the provisions adopted in accordance with Article 27 of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 apply the intervention agency of a Member State may conclude a contract for butter only if that butter is produced in that Member State and if it is:    - graded 'beurre de marque de contrôle' as regards Belgian butter;- graded 'Markenbutter' as regards German butter;- graded 'pasteurisé A' as regards French butter;- produced exclusively from cream which has been subjected to centrifugal and pasteurising treatment as regards Italian butter;- graded 'marque Rose' as regards Luxembourg butter;- graded 'Exportkwaliteit' as regards Netherlands butter. 1. The storage contract shall in particular include provisions as to:    (a) the quantity of butter or cream to which the contract relates;(b) the amount of aid;(c) the deposit, if any;(d) the dates relating to the execution of the contract, subject to the provisions of paragraph 2;(e) conditions to be laid down as to the minimum quantity of the product per lot;(f) the inspection measures which shall relate in particular to the nature of the stocks and whether the quantities stored agree with the quantities declared.2. Should the situation on the Community market so require the intervention agency may be authorised to remarket some or all of the stored butter or cream. 01. The amount of private storage aid shall be fixed for the Community with reference to storage costs and foreseeable price trends for fresh butter and stored butter.In cases where, at the time of removal from store, the market has developed unfavourably under conditions which could not be foreseen, the amount of aid may be increased.2. If the state of the market so requires, the amount of aid may be amended for future contracts. 1This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.It shall apply from 29 July 1968.This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

Intervention agencies shall buy-in throughout the milk year any skimmed milk powder of the kind mentioned in paragraph 1 which is offered to them.The Council, acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission, shall lay down conditions for the suspension and resumption of buying-in when the market situation so allows. Intervention agencies shall buy-in skimmed milk powder manufactured by the roller process at the same price as that for skimmed milk powder manufactured by the spray process, less, per 100 kg:    (a) 3 750 units of account for the 1968 69 milk year,(b) 4 750 units of account for the 1969 70 milk year. 1. The skimmed milk powder shall be delivered to a storage depot appearing in the list referred to in Article 4 and designated by the intervention agency.The intervention agency shall choose the available storage depot nearest to the place where the skimmed milk powder is stored. However, in special cases to be determined, another storage depot may be chosen.2. The intervention price shall apply to skimmed milk powder delivered to a storage depot not further from the place where it was stored than a distance to be determined.3. If the storage depot to which the skimmed milk powder is delivered is situated at a distance greater than that referred to in paragraph 2, the additional transport costs, to be determined at a flat rate, shall be borne by the intervention agency. A list of storage depots shall be drawn up before the beginning of the milk year in the light of information supplied by the Member States ; it may be amended during that year. Only storage depots satisfying criteria to be determined shall appear on the list. 1. The sale of skimmed milk powder held by intervention agencies shall take place when the date of its remarketing, the quantities involved, conditions of sale and selling prices have been determined.2. The selling price of first-quality skimmed milk powder shall be not less than a minimum price to be determined. This minimum price shall be higher than the intervention price by an amount to be determined with reference to the market situation and storage costs, in order to retain the possibility of voluntary storage. 1.

"input: 1. A free-at-frontier price shall be determined by the Commission for each pilot product.2. These prices shall be determined for products of good marketable quality. Free-at-frontier prices shall be determined on the basis of the most favourable purchasing opportunities in international trade in the products listed in Article 1 (a) 2 and (b) to (g) of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68, with the exception of assimilated products the levy on which is not equal to the levy on the related pilot product. When recording the most favourable purchasing opportunities in international trade, account shall be taken of all information on:    1. free-at-frontier prices ruling in the Community for products imported from third countries:2. prices on the markets of third countries, known to the Commission either direct or through Member States. When recording the most favourable purchasing opportunities in international trade, account shall not be taken of information:    1. relating to a small quantity unrepresentative of trade in the product in question;2. in respect of which price trends in general or other information available to it lead the Commission to believe that the price in question is unrepresentative of the real trend of the market. 1. Prices referred to in Article 3 which do not apply    (a) free-at-Community-frontier,(b) to products of good marketable quality, shall be adjusted.2. Prices referred to in Article 3 which apply to an assimilated product the levy on which is equal to the levy on the related pilot product shall be adjusted by taking account, in particular, of differences of      (a) composition,(b) maturity,(c) quality,(d) presentation,between the assimilated product and the related pilot product.Adjustments relating to composition shall be calculated by multiplying the difference between the milk component content of the pilot product and that of the assimilated product in question by the value attributed in international trade to a unit of weight of the milk component in question.Other adjustments shall be calculated with reference to the difference between the value attributed on the Community market to each of the relevant characteristics of the pilot product and the value attributed on that market to the corresponding characteristic of the assimilated product in question. When information on prices is not available the free-at-frontier price may be determined exceptionally on the basis of:    1. the value of the raw materials contained in the pilot product in question calculated on the basis of the prices of milk products for which prices are available,2. average processing costs,3. average yield. A free-at-frontier price may exceptionally be maintained unchanged for a limited period when:    1. the price for a given quality or origin which served as a basis for determining the previous  free-at-frontier price has not come to the knowledge of the Commission in time for determining the next free-at-frontier price, and2. the prices available, which the Commission does not regard as sufficiently representative of the real trend of the market, would entail sudden, substantial alterations in the free-at-frontier price. 1. Levies shall be fixed every fortnight. They shall, however, be altered in the intervening period if necessary.For the purposes of this Article, 'fortnight' means a period from the 1st to the 15th or from the 16th to the last day of a month.2. The levy on a product shall apply until another levy on the same product becomes applicable.3. Save express exceptions, levies shall be fixed in units of account per 100 kilogrammes. 1. For products falling within tariff sub-heading No 04.02 B I (b) 2, the component of the levy fixed by means of a coefficient expressing the weight ratio between the milk powder contained in the product and the product itself shall be calculated by multiplying the basic amount by the quantity of milk powder contained in the product.The basic amount shall be one-hundredth part of the levy    (a) on the pilot product of group No 2 in respect of products falling within tariff sub-heading No 04.02 B I (b) 2 (aa),(b) on the pilot product of group No 3, in respect of products falling within tariff sub-heading No 04.02 B I (b) 2 (bb),(c) calculated in accordance with Article 3 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 823/68, in respect of products falling within tariff sub-heading No 04.02 B I (b) 2 (cc).2. For products falling within tariff sub-heading No 04.02 II (b), the component of the levy fixed by means of a coefficient expressing the weight ratio between the milk components contained in the product and the product itself shall be calculated by multiplying the basic amount by the quantity of milk components contained in the product.The basic amount shall be one-hundredth part of the levy    (a) calculated in accordance with Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 823/68, in respect of products falling within tariff sub-heading No 04.02 B II (b) 1,(b) calculated in accordance with Article 5 (3) of that Regulation, in respect of products falling within tariff sub-heading No 04.02 B II (b) 2. 01. By way of derogation from the provisions of Article 8 (1), the first fixing of levies shall be for the period 29 July to 15 August 1968.2. When levies are fixed for that period the levies on white sugar to be taken into account pursuant to Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 823/68 shall be those valid during the first twenty days of July 1968. 1The pilot products and assimilated products referred to in this Regulation are those listed in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 823/68. 2This Regulation shall enter into force on 29 July 1968.This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

For calculating the average price referred to in the second indent of Article 4 of this Regulation, the average price obtained by member producers for each of the three calendar years preceding that in which they joined the organisation shall be determined: - on the basis of available commercial and accounting documents admissible as evidence, or, where no such proof is available,- by calculating the average price ruling for each product on the most representative producer market for the area in which the head office of the producers' organisation in question is situated, this average price being the average of the representative prices recorded in that market by the competent authorities of the Member State during the year under consideration, account being taken, where necessary, of seasonal variations in production. 1. Applications for reimbursement must relate to expenditure effected by Member States in the course of one calendar year and must be submitted to the Commission once a year before 31 December of the following year.However, applications for reimbursement of expenditure effected in 1967 may be submitted up to 30 December 1969.2.
