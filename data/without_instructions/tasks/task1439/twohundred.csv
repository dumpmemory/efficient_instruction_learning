"input: CONTEXT: I make bacon and other cured meats frequently. I find that the amount of liquid released from pork belly varies. That is not a useful measure of how the cure is proceeding. Bacon, in particular, is usually cooked after the cure, so I don't worry too much. I use the salt-box method, coat the belly in cure mixture, place in large zip lock, place in container slightly larger than belly and put in fridge. Flip every day or so for a week. What I look for next is a firming up of the belly. I pinch it. If it has firmed up after a week, I move on to hot smoking (or you could use your oven). If it still feels soft, I give it another day or two.  <sep>  Q: How much juice should come out when I'm curing pork belly? A: I find that the amount of liquid released from pork belly varies  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: My latest batch has extracted less than half of the juice of the first two. Is this normal?

"input: CONTEXT: Traditionally, mozzarella is sold extremely fresh - as in made that day or the day before. If it's held for more than a day or so, it comes packaged in a brine. Most of the American stuff is just too soft to be held for packaging like other shredded cheese in the mega-mart.In the US, being extreme gluttons for convenience, we tend to make do with part-skim shredded mozzarella instead of the good stuff. Slight temperature variations can make the shreds stick together in a globby mass. It's harmless from a safety point of view, and the expiry date can be long after the occurrence of perfectly safe globbiness.Pro-Tip: Put the globby pieces in the freezer for 20 minutes, and then shred it like a block of harder cheese. Upon heating, it will melt (almost) as if the the globbiness had never happened. I have taken advantage of a few good sales that way. Mozzarella will become... ehem... colorful before it becomes unsafe. While this answer is more for mozzerella than for other types of cheese; the last paragraph works for any mega-mart shredded cheese.  <sep>  Q: Why would unopened shredded cheese get soggy in the fridge?

Follow the much more helpful links in the comments that follow this and make the oil properly.Once you do this you can cook pretty much anything that needs a little (or a lot) of extra heat. You said you have other peppers so it might be interesting to set up a few jars with different pepper combos.Bonus: if what I've heard of these peppers is correct, you can probably make a low grade mace this way.If you're looking for something to do right away, I'd mix a very small piece in some melty cheese and throw it on some chips, burritos, pizza, or anything really.

"input: CONTEXT: My whole wheat bread takes 4x to go off than my white bread. Even a mixture of 50% whole wheat flour will make it last longer. But that will only help if the problem is the bread getting hard too soon. That can also be prevented by keeping it in a plastic bag. You'll get the mold before the bread goes stale.If you're keeping the bread in a plastic bag, try paper bags.To solve the mold problem, the traditional way is to add some acidity. For example, you can add a sourdough starter. If you don't like the taste of sourdough, a poolish starter should also help. The bacteria it grows will prevent the mold growing.I know it's not what you're asking, but freezing will also help. When you bake more bread than you eat, freeze it wrapped in a plastic bag and thaw it overnight and you will get a good, fresh bread.  <sep>  Q: Is there anything I can add to homemade bread to preserve it?

Depending on the type of soup you are making you may have some cooking liquid left over which would be far preferable to plain water.In fact it's not a bad idea to start with a little more cooking liquid than necessary. Use a fine-mesh sieve to separate the soup ingredients from the cooking liquid. You can then re-introduce the cooking-liquid a bit at a time until you arrive at the right texture.

"input: CONTEXT: Ribs should not be cooked with direct heat, generally. The directions on the meat are VERY defective. You should turn the left burner on, and put the ribs in the right side of the grill. You should cook at a temperature between 250-300F, typically for 4-5 hours. They're done when the meat pulls back from the bone and when you can easily tear the meat between bones, not when they hit a certain temperature. Check out amazingribs.com, and also get your money back. The instructions on the packaging border on fraud.  <sep>  Q: I burn my ribs to a crisp, what does ""medium high"" mean?

"input: CONTEXT: I would not keep it or eat it and just consider it a loss. That is a long time for the food to cool down/seal, etc. The processing time is usually carefully calculated so that the core of the product in the jar gets to the proper temp. With the processing time only being 10 mins it would mean only the jar and maybe a small amount on the edges would have gotten to 240 deg F. I suppose it could make a difference if it was a hot pack vs. cold pack, but I would still not risk it.Since you're an experienced canner, I assume you already know that it's possible to lose pressure during the process and then restart the time when the canner gets back up to pressure, but that is usually a few minutes at most, not hours.  <sep>  Q: If there was an interruption in canning process, would the meat still be safe?

"input: CONTEXT: Honestly, all three of those will crisp up very quickly, and just about any ratio will produce a crispy end product. The blend may be for textural reasons; potato starch is typically very fine and produces a tempura-like shell, while rice flour can have little bits of individual rice grains which produces a ""chunkier"" texture.I probably wouldn't try to use pure starch as it will brown and burn very easily, but you probably don't even need all three ingredients. Personally, I'd start with a 50/50 blend of potato starch and rice flour and adjust from there. You could use tapioca starch instead of potato if it's easier for you to find locally, but definitely keep rice flour in the mix.  <sep>  Q: Any ideas what ratio of flour, potato startch and rice flour would be optimal for getting a crispy wing?

"input: CONTEXT: The primary reason is definitely convenience. If you don't want skin and seeds in your sauce, then you have to do some work to avoid it. Yes, it's possible, e.g. passing through a food mill, or blanching and peeling plus retaining only the flesh, but having it already done is a whole lot easier.Passata is usually much thicker too, so it won't need as long a cooking time to reduce into a non-watery sauce as fresh tomatoes. On top of that, you don't have to worry about whether you can find good fresh tomatoes, e.g. if it's winter and they're out of season.Your two cases for comparison seem to overlook this: if you just chop and cook, you'll have skin and seeds in your sauce, as well as excess liquid to cook down, while if you use passata, you won't. (Also, for what it's worth, you'd need pretty giant tomatoes to get the equivalent of 3/4 cup of passata out of one tomato.)Of course, if you don't mind skin and seeds, it's also perfectly fine to simply cook fresh tomatoes and be done with it.Note that you can often get similar advantages from other canned tomato products. In the US, crushed tomatoes are far more common, and a roughly similar texture. (Peeled whole tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste can also be useful depending on what texture you're aiming for.)  <sep>  Q: Why specifically use Passata, rather than tomatoes, in Ragu? A: The primary reason is definitely convenience  Q: what is a specific difference? A: Passata is usually much thicker  Q: do I cook it much longer?

"input: CONTEXT: I use 1 rounded teaspoon for 12 to 16 ounces (depends on the mug I'm using), so about 8 teaspoons (or about 2 1/2 tbsp) for a gallon of water. Hot water, just under boiling, is best. Ideally, the water is heated and poured onto the tea at just under boiling. Because I don't think you want to boil a gallon of water, I'd use the amount of hibiscus for a gallon of tea, but only use about a quart of hot water to start, let the tea steep in that (at least 5 minutes, longer will give a stronger flavor) then add the remaining 3 quarts of water.  <sep>  Q: Do you know how to Brew Hibiscus tea?

"input: CONTEXT: There is some difference between the flavor, but seeing as there are so many other predominant flavors in Worcestershire sauce and that fact that you're (hopefully) not drinking it straight, it's fairly insignificant. It's very common for one product produced in different countries to have a range of manufacturing differences, sometimes arbitrary, sometimes to suit the local palate, and sometimes because of costs, hence people calling American Lea & Perrins a ""knockoff.""I've had both, and can assure you that once you've mixed it into a casserole or marinade you won't really miss anything.

output: ",Yes
"input: CONTEXT: There's no reason why you couldn't boil vegetables as you make the stock and then puree them in as a base. It's really about taste and the result you want. Making the stock without vegetables in it will give you a clear broth with a simple pork flavor and the vegetables will be distinct in it. If you add vegetables while cooking the stock and then puree them in your base will be much more vegetable-y, and opaque - the color will be determined by the vegetables added. The pork taste will be a bit more hidden by vegetable flavors. Spices and herbs are 2 separate matters. In general you can overcook herbs very easily but it's hard to overcook spices (although some spices can change during long cooking times). Adding bay (laurel) is one of the exceptions herb-wise. Spice-wise adding at the beginning will make the spice permeate the meat, careful not to overdo it though.Like I said it's all about the look and taste you want.  <sep>  Q: Should I add vegetables and spices in the stock-making stage of pig-knuckle soup? A: There's no reason why you couldn't boil vegetables as you make the stock and then puree them in as a base.

"input: CONTEXT: As far as I can see, you don't defrost the pie before baking in the recipe so some of the time in the oven would just be defrosting the pie; so this could be done in advance by bringing it out of the freezer an hour and a half before baking say. As the chicken is already cooked it looks like all you're doing is cooking the pastry so you could just use thinner pastry which would cook quicker, or better you could use layers of phyllo pasty which would cook a lot quicker but of course wouldn't puff up like the puff pastry.If you follow this it could probably bake for just 25 minutes or there about.Hope this helps!  <sep>  Q: How can I reduce baking time for a frozen pot pie?

"input: CONTEXT: Scallions are very touchy. You don't want them to dry out, and yet you don't want them too wet or they will get slimy and disgusting.What works best for me is remove any binding holding them together (e.g. rubber band or twisty-tie), (and certainly trim off any parts of the scallions that are already damaged and/or slimy), don't wash until you are ready to use them, wrap the bunch of scallions loosely (but completely covered) in a paper towel, and then store that wrapped bundle in a flimsy plastic bag (maybe the one you brought them home from the supermarket in) in your refrigerator. Sounds ""fussy"" when you lay out all the steps like that, but really, it's not a whole lot of work. Removing the rubber band etc. prevents damage where it would cut into the veg. flesh, paper towel absorbs condensation & liquid water which will rot the scallions (paper towel will prob. become slightly damp after a while in the fridge, but this is OK), plastic bag prevents evaporation of moist air.I find this works well for lots of greens, esp. cilantro - the worst offender in the demanding vegetables category.P.S. If you aren't too squeamish, you can even remove the very outermost layer of a scallion which has begun to ""slime-out"", wash the remainder right before using - & it's fine!  <sep>  Q: How do I preserve scallions? A: Scallions are very touchy. You don't want them to dry out, and yet you don't want them too wet or they will get slimy and disgusting  Q: What is the best way to keep them fresh longer?

"input: CONTEXT: I'm an American cornbread lover living in the UK, so I have some experience with this. In the UK and commonwealth corn flour = US cornstarch, and in the UK corn meals are coarser then their US counterparts. Coarse polenta is like ball bearings, fine polenta is still too coarse for decent cornbread and fritters. You can get fine corn meal in the UK now, which is slightly finer than your average US cornmeal, but not as fine as US corn flour. So if I'm in the US using an American recipe that calls for fine corn meal I'd just use regular corn meal, if I'm in the US using a UK recipe and it calls for fine corn meal it would probably mean fine polenta, which is what you generally get in the US.  <sep>  Q: What is ""fine ground cornmeal""?

"input: CONTEXT: In the fridge, an hour should not be a problem, but could still end up bitter depending on the kind of onion used. Usually, Marinades, Pestos etc. that use mashed onions and/or garlic taste best if they are made the way the name ""Pesto"" suggests: Cutting stuff very fine, then using a mortar and pestle. Most explanations WHY that is the case have to with the fact that blenders tend to disintegrate cell walls with relatively rough cuts of a fast but half-sharp or blunt blade, releasing more enzymes etc. from the cell walls as opposed to from the cell contents. These are plausible, since some of the compounds in different parts of onion cells are known to actively react when the onion is disintegrated.Also, try adding oil (which you often want in a marinade anyway. No unrefined olive oil in a blender, though - that is known to get bitter!) while mortaring or blending - this will help extract flavor compounds and probably provide some oxidation protection.There is a well known marinade working with onions, garlic etc: Bulgogi marinade.  <sep>  Q: How long can blended onions stay relatively fresh?

"input: CONTEXT: Some of the volatile flavors will be diminished, but I've managed to make fairly good drinks with the help of mint that I kept frozen. In my experience, freezer burn starts to become visible after two or three months, and starts to harm flavor probably around 4-6 months.I'm not sure preparing the drink will work really well, but if you just defrost the drink in the refrigerator, it probably won't be terrible. Active thawing with heat will probably cause some harm. Many infusions and teas become a bit cloudy and lose color after bottling or freezing, which is why most bottled teas use an enzyme (not usually a listed ingredient) designed to mitigate that.  <sep>  Q: Would freezing affect the flavour of mint tea?

"input: CONTEXT: As with all fish, just don't cook it any longer than necessary - all you need is long enough to get the temperature up (to 145F/63C), and anything past that is just overcooking. Boiling is a really fast cooking method, and simmering or poaching is not much slower. Note that this also means removing it from the water as soon as it's done, since the water is way above the necessary temperature and will easily overcook seafood even if it's removed from the stove.Tiny fish like you mention will probably be done in only a minute or two, similar to small. The best way to tell, though, is not to use a timer but to directly check the fish: it should be opaque and flaky. (For small fish, those aren't very big flakes, but you could still pull it apart or bend it and tell.)  <sep>  Q: How to cook small fish(unfrozen and frozen) in water without overcooking?

"input: CONTEXT: Mold is growing because there's something for it to consume, the only way to prevent it from happening is to clean your grill more effectively, or carbonize it before the fire goes out. No grill is air-tight, so even though it gets a good heat blast (not enough to sterilize it as you may think), spores will get in from outside. Remember, hot air is less dense, so as the BBQ cools it will draw air in, hence the spores. Once there they thrive in the sheltered and often damp conditions in a closed-up barbecue. I think where you may be going wrong is that you close the valves after cooking. That cuts off the air and kills the fire. I leave all my valves open to keep it as hot as possible after I'm done cooking, and it does a better job of charring all the leftovers.  <sep>  Q: Curious mold growth in a sealled BBQ, how does one avoid it?

"input: CONTEXT: Generally speaking, frying gives a better crust due to the higher direct heat producing more Maillard flavours. A good, heavy, screaming hot pan is required. Oil the steak, not the pan, with vegetable or groundnut oil (olive oil will burn), and baste with butter towards the end for extra flavour.If your steak is thick, you might try a reverse sear - roast the steak at about 150Â°C until the centre is 10Â°C off your desired doneness level (if you don't have a digital probe thermometer, invest the small amount they cost, it is completely worth it), then sear the outside on your mega hot pan.

"input: CONTEXT: To make you pancakes spread more, and thus be thinner, increase the amount of liquid in the recipe. This will make the batter less viscous, so that it will spread more before beginning to set, thus giving you thinner pancakes. I would start slowly, perhaps a couple of tablespoons extra milk (or just plain water) until you find the consistency that you like.You will also have to experiment to determine the appropriate cooking time, as the additional liquid will somewhat need to be cooked off to get the best texture.Of course, there is nothing wrong with using the bottom of your ladle to help the batter spread out a bit more. This is normal, and will somewhat even out as the pancakes cook.  <sep>  Q: How can I get thinner pancakes?

"input: CONTEXT: First off, when reheating soup, it won't matter much. If you get the pan too hot before you add the soup, you could get some spattering, but that's about it.As for making a fresh batch, there are those who believe that browning the ingredients before adding the liquids will develop more flavor. This will be a lot easier to do with a hot pan, than trying to get a cold pan full of stuff up to a heat sufficient to cause browning. Overall, it's a tradeoff. If you're in a hurry, it might be worth saving the few minutes to just throw everything in the pan and heat it up. If you really want to develop every last bit of flavor, you'll probably be better off heating your pan, browning ingredients, then adding liquid.  <sep>  Q: Should I preheat the pot if I am going to make soup or put in the ingredients and heat it all up together?

"input: CONTEXT: A lot of sourdough recipes don't call for a sponge, per se, because the starter essentially already is a sponge. The purpose of a sponge in a bread with normal yeast is to allow a longer fermentation time and extra time for enzymatic reactions to happen in the flour before adding it to the final batch. This isn't necessary with sourdough the starter is continuously fermenting and reacting. And your guess is about right, if the proportion of starter you add is too high, the waste products and dead yeast cells in it can cause changes in the gluten that make it very slack and unusable.  <sep>  Q: How does a sourdough sponge work?

"input: CONTEXT: No, bartenders do not shake carbonated beverages. I was a bartender for years and I have never known this to happen or be part of a recipe. The carbonated sodas are always put on the top of the glass after pouring. The foam comes from the sugar or egg whites in the sweet n sour mix. You can find that recipe on line. Here is one that is overly complicated, bars rarely (never to my knowledge) use fresh lemon or lime juice. However a good bar uses separate lemon & lime mix for different drinks, or they used to anyway. I personally use limeade or lemonade at home. You can use one of the other or mix them together.

"input: CONTEXT: I would use any uncolored brandy made from distilled fruit. Himbeergeist, sliwowitz, or what you can lay your hands on. Kirsch doesn't taste much like cherries, and I suspect that it functions more as a solvent for some of the aroma in the spices than for adding its own taste. Even though it does contribute a bit, the taste will be subtle, and other slight fruity notes from a different fruit brandy will blend with the heavy spices just as well. In a pinch, you could use a colored brandy too, like Chantre. But it will add more of its own flavor, and while it can make a good combination, it will be further from the original than a random obstwasser.

First, cook the soup until your noodles are al dente (but will become just right while cooling at a normal speed). Take the big pot of soup off the heat. Second, take a small pot, and fill it with just one portion of soup per eater. Put it on the heat, and cook until the noodles are done. (Alternatively, put the single portions into porcelain bowls and microwave until the noodles are ready - it spares you washing an additional pot, but I wouldn't nuke a good soup for no reason). Third, eat your cooked soup portions and let the big pot of soup slowly cool on its own. Fourth, freeze the soup from the big pot. Finis. Note that from a food safety point of view, you are better off with flash cooling the soup. But what I outlined here is probably much simple and hassle-free.

If you don't dry them they will get mushy and rot in the oil, which isn't very pleasant. Drying them in your oven will stink up your house big-time, but it's worth it. Alternatively you can make chili strings with them and they will air dry, or you can freeze them for years and they'll stay good.  <sep>  Q: What oil do I use to infuse with hot chilis?

I stored them overnight in the fridge in a large ice cream tub, rather than refrigerating the crock. (Thanks for that tip Joe and MargeGunderson.)In the morning, I combined everything in the crock pot and brought it to work. I started the crock pot on low at 8am. Everything was already cooked, so no need to worry there. The meatballs were heated through by noon. (Thanks everyone for the tip on starting early.

"input: CONTEXT: I've never tried steaming bok choy, but yes, the ribs and leafy bits cook at different speeds.For stir frys I trim the bottom so the ribs come free, clean off any dirt that's gotten trapped in between, then stack up the leaves and cut the leaves from the ribs. I slice the ribs into about 5mm / 3/16"" slices, and add them towards the end; the leaves I cut into ribbons (perpendicular to the ribs), and stir them in at the last second, so they barely cook. The center I just chop the top off the leafy bit, and slice the more rib-like bits a litte larger than the rest of the ribs (they're thinner, so cook faster).As I've never tried steaming it, and I don't tend to cook in bags (except for silver turtles when camping), this is going to be a complete guess. Now, it tastes fine al dente, so you could leave the ribs as large as I use for a stir fry, but en papillote tends to be fancier cooking, so I'd probably try for maybe 1/6"" slices or a little thicker (maybe 2-3mm), and if you had a mandoline so they all came out even, that'd be great. I'd still cut the leaves into ribbons, just because it's easier to eat than a huge intact leaf.I'd assume that the leaves would cook at a similar rate as spinich, and the ribs closer to fennel, if that helps at all.  <sep>  Q: How should I prepare Bok Choy before I cook it?

"input: CONTEXT: Lime juice isn't going to make it less spicy, if anything I've found it accentuates the spiciness a bit although I'm not sure of the mechanism. It could be that the acidity frees up more capsaicin compounds (what makes hot food hot), or wakes up your taste buds more. Most likely you have simply added a weak jalapeno. Peppers of the same variety can vary in heat strength quite a bit depending on the where and how it was grown, although you'll get weak and strong peppers from the same plant. You can make up for the lack of spice by adding more jalapeno or a bit of hot chili powder.  <sep>  Q: Does lime juice make jalapeÃ±os less spicy?

"input: CONTEXT: The brown color of the stock comes from the cooking method, not the kind of bones, a chicken stock cooked in the ""brown stock"" method can be as dark as what we expect beef stock to be.Roasting the bones was a good start; but you also need to brown the vegetables, either with the bones for the last half hour or in a pan on the stovetop.One of the most important parts of brown stock is to add tomato to the vegetable mix, either finely diced or more often tomato paste. Cooking the tomato to a dark brick red will round out the components needed to make a very dark stock.

"input: CONTEXT: I'm specifically answering your question ""Is it okay to use a microwave in convection mode without the turntable?"" -- Yes.Your own answer points out the reality that if a pan is too large then the turn table will simply hit the sides of the microwave oven and then stop turning. There is nothing wrong with this. There is nothing wrong or damaging to have a metal tin touch the metal sides of your oven.How was your baked items bottom? If you can sit your tin up so there is air flow under your tin, then you will improve the baking efficiency and it will bake more evenly.CAUTION: If anyone else is reading this question and wondering about their own machine, then you really need to take caution about the ""convention only"" mode.

"input: CONTEXT: Mixing it with milk (or liquid in general) is probably just to remove clumps. It clumps easily, especially when things aren't perfectly airtight (probably more common in your grandmother's time), and mixing in a small amount of liquid is an easy way to make sure it all breaks up.I'm less sure about the alternating. It is pretty common to alternate wet and dry as a way of getting things evenly mixed and avoiding lumps, so it's possible it's a variation on that. The paste might be too thick to easily mix into the wet, but also wet enough that it'd tend to stay as a lump if you mix it straight into the dry, so alternating wet-dry-paste might get you more even mixing? But if you're able to mix the paste smoothly into the wet, it's completely fine to just do that.  <sep>  Q: Why pre-mix baking soda into 2 tsp of milk?

At some point (around 5-10 minutes of steeping at ~95Â°C), you will lose majority of the 'good stuff' and continue picking up less desirable compounds. You will notice that while colour might persist, the taste will be come less and less desirable.

"input: CONTEXT: Scallions are very touchy. You don't want them to dry out, and yet you don't want them too wet or they will get slimy and disgusting.What works best for me is remove any binding holding them together (e.g. rubber band or twisty-tie), (and certainly trim off any parts of the scallions that are already damaged and/or slimy), don't wash until you are ready to use them, wrap the bunch of scallions loosely (but completely covered) in a paper towel, and then store that wrapped bundle in a flimsy plastic bag (maybe the one you brought them home from the supermarket in) in your refrigerator. Sounds ""fussy"" when you lay out all the steps like that, but really, it's not a whole lot of work. Removing the rubber band etc. prevents damage where it would cut into the veg. flesh, paper towel absorbs condensation & liquid water which will rot the scallions (paper towel will prob. become slightly damp after a while in the fridge, but this is OK), plastic bag prevents evaporation of moist air.I find this works well for lots of greens, esp. cilantro - the worst offender in the demanding vegetables category.P.S. If you aren't too squeamish, you can even remove the very outermost layer of a scallion which has begun to ""slime-out"", wash the remainder right before using - & it's fine!  <sep>  Q: How do I preserve scallions?

"input: CONTEXT: Breads get their structure from glutens--a type of protein formed by the combination of glutenin with gliaten. Kneading and resting the dough helps the formation of glutens--I assume by shifting glutenin and gliatin molecules around, this increases the odds of bindings occurring.Oils can bind to glutenin and gliatin and inhibit these reactions, so fats--oils and butter--definitely play a role in the texture control.It prevents the dough from getting too elastic, which controls texture. This elasticity change would also change the maximum air bubble size. Altering resting times and yeast quantity also change these, but trading off for a different flavor. Oil may play other roles, but these are what I recall reading about off the top of my head. Yes, it does contribute to flavor as well.  <sep>  Q: What is the purpose of oil or butter in bread?

"input: CONTEXT: To prevent the sticking, you might want to use a spray oil, maybe even just on the foil before you put the vegetables and potatoes on. It's a tiny amount of oil, not enough to make things noticeably greasy, but will be pretty effective. Another spray over the top will make them brown a little more nicely and may even prevent a little drying out. Alternatively, you can just toss them all in a bowl with a small amount of oil; it really doesn't take much, and I'd hardly describe it as ""covering with a lot of oil.""As for preventing things from drying out, first and foremost, don't overcook them. Broccoli and onions both roast very nicely, but you definitely want to pull it out before it starts browning/burning too much. If you slice the potatoes thinly enough, they'll cook in roughly the same amount of time as the broccoli and onions. So if things are getting overcooked, just don't leave them in the oven as long.You can also always try covering them. Another sheet of foil over the top will trap a fair amount of moisture, letting them steam a bit and probably preventing some burning as well.(I suppose it's also possible that it's all drying out because you're cooking them too slowly, so they have plenty of time for moisture to escape, but that seems less likely given the way you described things.)  <sep>  Q: When I cook my meat, I usually bake or broil it, I basically use the oven. I like using the oven to make the side dish while baking the meat. Usually the side dish consists of a combination of sweet potatoes / yams, broccoli and onions.

"input: CONTEXT: Short answer: No.Long answer: this could probably be made to work, but only for a short time. At some point, and probably within a few uses, the rapid heat cycling from the fire would cause the pizza stone to crack.Pizza stones are made from corderite or clay, sometimes with grog. This offers a smoother surface than firebrick, but that smooth surface is because of a higher amount of vitrification and less airspace in the ceramic. This means they are less resistant to cracking due thermal shock, and the fact that your pizza stone is 1/4 a thick as firebrick makes that worse.In contrast, firebrick is a standard 2.5"" thick, and made from higher-temperature materials with more airspace in the clay itself. These properties give it both higher thermal insulation, and higher thermal mass (so that it cools down slower). Both of these properties help it resist cracking.  <sep>  Q: Pizza stone as floor pizza oven vs firebrick A: This offers a smoother surface than firebrick  Q: Does it get as hot as firebrick?

"input: CONTEXT: What you describe is grill basting - where a liquid is poured onto the grill and covered (with a metal salad bowl or a basting cover) to more evenly cook the food and maintain its moisture. The liquid is added towards the latter half of cooking, as adding it in the first half of cooking has no real beneficial effect. Additionally, the steam will melt cheese more evenly if grilling burger patties.

"input: CONTEXT: I'm not a professional fudger, but here is my theory: one should add it to the boiling mixture. The reason is that butter has milk solids that are said to âburnâ at low temperatures (somewhere in the range 120C-150C or 250F-300F) which just above the soft ball stage (113C or 235F) needed for making fudge. I interpret the burning to mean that those milk solids (sugars and proteins) get a chance to contribute to the Maillard reaction that gives caramel (and its grained cousin the fudge) its great and rich flavor. Given how unique and varied the flavors arising from butter are, I would not want to miss their contribution by adding them after the heat is gone.  <sep>  Q: Butter usage in fudge? A: I'm not a professional fudger, but here is my theory: one should add it to the boiling mixture  Q: I have a number of questions relating to fudge. Thank you in advance for your help.

"input: CONTEXT: Personally I'd suggest blanching your pasta. By blanching:I mean get a big pan of heavily salted water on a rolling boil. Drop your pasta into the water, give it a stir.After 1 min or when the water has come back to boil drain the pasta off.At this point your pasta will still be el' dante but not raw which is what I suspect the directions are suggesting when they say ""2 min less than instructed"" then just use it at the mixing with sour cream step.If you were to just use the pasta freshly made it will likely not have the texture desired. Boiling it will help moisten it up and start to cook the flour.  <sep>  Q: Is using homemade pasta instead of dried in a bake recommended?

"input: CONTEXT: It should be about 7 crackers per cup, maybe 8, depending how finely you crush them. One of the inner packages from your 14.4oz box should be plenty (there are probably three packages with 9 in each, or 4.8oz). If you need to go the other way, that's 1/7 to 1/8 cup per cracker, or more simply, 0.5oz or 15g per cracker.I know this from making graham cracker crusts - and you can confirm it by looking at some recipes. You generally need 1.5 cups of crumbs for a pie crust, and it takes 10-12 crackers. I've seen recipes ranging from 9 to 12 crackers (and checked ten or so when writing this), but I don't think I've ever used fewer than 10. One cup is 2/3 of that, 7 or 8 crackers. (Some people do say 20 or 24 squares, but they're clearly half-cracker squares, not the whole crackers.)For what it's worth, the Martha Stewart crust recipe says ""6 1/2 ounces graham crackers (12 crackers), finely ground (1 1/2 cups)"", and 2/3 of that is 4 1/3 oz, pretty close to 1/3 of your box, maybe a cracker short, so by weight this works out too.  <sep>  Q: How much is a cup of graham cracker crumbs in crackers and weight?###I have a recipe that calls for one cup of graham cracker crumbs.

"input: CONTEXT: Short answer: No.Long answer: this could probably be made to work, but only for a short time. At some point, and probably within a few uses, the rapid heat cycling from the fire would cause the pizza stone to crack.Pizza stones are made from corderite or clay, sometimes with grog. This offers a smoother surface than firebrick, but that smooth surface is because of a higher amount of vitrification and less airspace in the ceramic. This means they are less resistant to cracking due thermal shock, and the fact that your pizza stone is 1/4 a thick as firebrick makes that worse.In contrast, firebrick is a standard 2.5"" thick, and made from higher-temperature materials with more airspace in the clay itself. These properties give it both higher thermal insulation, and higher thermal mass (so that it cools down slower). Both of these properties help it resist cracking.  <sep>  Q: Pizza stone as floor pizza oven vs firebrick A: This offers a smoother surface than firebrick  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Does it get as hot as firebrick?

"input: CONTEXT: Traditionally, mozzarella is sold extremely fresh - as in made that day or the day before. If it's held for more than a day or so, it comes packaged in a brine. Most of the American stuff is just too soft to be held for packaging like other shredded cheese in the mega-mart.In the US, being extreme gluttons for convenience, we tend to make do with part-skim shredded mozzarella instead of the good stuff. Slight temperature variations can make the shreds stick together in a globby mass. It's harmless from a safety point of view, and the expiry date can be long after the occurrence of perfectly safe globbiness.Pro-Tip: Put the globby pieces in the freezer for 20 minutes, and then shred it like a block of harder cheese. Upon heating, it will melt (almost) as if the the globbiness had never happened. I have taken advantage of a few good sales that way. Mozzarella will become... ehem... colorful before it becomes unsafe. While this answer is more for mozzerella than for other types of cheese; the last paragraph works for any mega-mart shredded cheese.  <sep>  Q: Why would unopened shredded cheese get soggy in the fridge?

"input: CONTEXT: I don't think this has a single answer: The amount of alcohol would depend on the alcohol content of the soaking liquor or liqueur, soaking time, temperature of chocolate, and how thick the strawberry was. I suspect uncut strawberries would take at least several days to fully absorb alcohol and reach equilibrium, but the surface should take up alcohol fairly quickly. If they are cut up, exposing the more porous interior, I imagine an overnight soak would be sufficient to reach maximum alcohol content. The enormous, bloated mutant strawberries you sometimes see at stores could take considerably longer than others to absorb their maximum alcohol. Alcohol is much more volatile than water, so the immersion in warm, melted chocolate would remove some alcohol, but once the chocolate cools, it should trap any remaining content.The flavor of alcohol is easily masked by other flavors at under 20% content; this could explain why your friend didn't taste it, but you did. It's quite possible the strawberries packed a sobriety-busting punch, but it was disguised by the chocolate and fruit tastes.  <sep>  Q: How much alcohol remains in strawberries soaked in alcohol?

"input: CONTEXT: We have a convection oven and almost always use it. I can't remember the last time we didn't use convection. Our model automatically decreases the temperature, so if you set it for 300, then it will heat to 275. Not sure if that is a magic 25 degree number, but it seems to work. Almost all recipes cook time wise as they would with a non-convection oven. Our also has a single and multi-rack mode, and it circulates the air differently in that case.

"input: CONTEXT: There's no reason why you couldn't boil vegetables as you make the stock and then puree them in as a base. It's really about taste and the result you want. Making the stock without vegetables in it will give you a clear broth with a simple pork flavor and the vegetables will be distinct in it. If you add vegetables while cooking the stock and then puree them in your base will be much more vegetable-y, and opaque - the color will be determined by the vegetables added. The pork taste will be a bit more hidden by vegetable flavors. Spices and herbs are 2 separate matters. In general you can overcook herbs very easily but it's hard to overcook spices (although some spices can change during long cooking times). Adding bay (laurel) is one of the exceptions herb-wise. Spice-wise adding at the beginning will make the spice permeate the meat, careful not to overdo it though.Like I said it's all about the look and taste you want.  <sep>  Q: Should I add vegetables and spices in the stock-making stage of pig-knuckle soup?

"input: CONTEXT: I've struggled with this issue as well because I live in a moist climate and instant espresso powder cakes up on me between uses.Generally recipes which use instant espresso power are trying to add a kick of bitter and roasted flavors to deepen chocolate flavors and make them richer. You can try substituting instant coffee 1:1, but the flavor of the baked good will certainly suffer a loss of richness. Increasing the amount of instant coffee, however, would likely add more bitter or acidic flavors -- and caffeine -- to the cookie or cake than you want. Also, instant coffee takes longer to dissolve, so it needs to be added straight to a liquid.There's no real way to substitute liquid coffee in most recipes, such as chocolate cookie or brownie recipes, because the recipe has no water in it in the first place. In the rare recipes where there is water, you could substitute strong-brewed coffee for an equal quantity of water+espresso powder, and this would likely work fairly well.So, summing up: there's no really good substitute for instant espresso powder in recipes which call for it that I've found with some significant experimentation. Hopefully someone else has had better ideas than me.  <sep>  Q: Instant espresso powder substitutions?

"input: CONTEXT: Our brains are wired to consider food more palatable if the dedicated taste receptors (one of the six basic tastes) for salt are triggered. And in a non-urban world, salt/sodium is a valuable nutrient; the fact we might have it too readily available in the developed world doesn't change that we would DIE on a zero-sodium diet (mind that animal products like meat aren't zero-sodium, and that herbivores tend to love licking salt where they find it!). So our brains have a good evolutionary reason to like salt.Also, salt actively interferes (negatively) with another basic taste receptor - the receptor for bitterness (which can mean poison both in nature and in the developed world, or at least something we have no use for, eg an alkali). Most aromatic food (think green vegetables or spices) is bitter, and salt both attenuates that perception and balances it making the combined food still desirable for our brain. You end up with an even more palatable food since you can use an aromatic (desirable) and shut out the bitterness (not always desirable) response.Umami is a different basic taste, probably related to the presence of protein (glutamate, inosinate, guanylate... trigger it - these are amino acids or salts thereof, and an indicator of easily-digestible protein presence).  <sep>  Q: Why does salt enhance the flavor of food?

There isn't really a way to tell if this is near or not without chemical analysis.In watermelon country (I live near an ancient greek watermelon port) watermelon is generally refrigerated.

"input: CONTEXT: While I suspect that the formula is mostly reliable if you repeat the experiment with the same person, I found the individual heat sensitivity varies a lot. Most professional cooks and seasoned homemakers can handle (pun intended) higher heat than those who rarely expose their hands to high temperatures. In our home, weâve had heated discussions about whether the dishes in the just finished dishwasher are too hot to touch or not. And this is just one example.If you exclude the differences between individuals, using your own handâs heat sensitivity to gauge a temperature range is absolutely possible (as long as a few degrees donât matter). It takes time and practice - which is usually described as âexperienceâ. I personally donât think in âdegreesâ though, but more in categories like âtoo coldâ / âshould be okâ / âtoo hotâ and a few steps in between. So in short, if you need a precise temperature, get a thermometer. If you are still working on judging by hand, either get a thermometer or plan a few trial-and-error loops. And sometimes the exact temperature is not important for a recipe to work.Using the X-time at Y-distance formula may work, if your heat sensitivity is similar to the authorâs.  <sep>  Q: How accurate is the hand technique for grilling?

"input: CONTEXT: This 'trick' is used by many a fine chef. Meat is salted, wrapped and refrigerated hours or even overnight, prior to cooking. Yes, salt will draw moisture from the meat initially, but over time that moisture will migrate back into the meat taking the salt with it! The salt also breaks down the protein structure in the muscle rendering a more tender steak.The steak is rinsed and dried (a wet steak will steam not char), seasoned, and fired.Ground beef can be handled in the same fashion. Using a medium or coarse salt and erring on the less salty side, you can find the right proportion to suit your taste. Season before forming or after. Some contend that the seasoning is made bitter by the heat and flame of the grill. Go figure.Other tips: The meat should be mixed and formed with a gentle hand â use only as much pressure as it takes to hold the patties together. For almost foolproof rare or medium-rare meat, go right from fridge to grill.  <sep>  Q: Do you know why, what makes a burger taste so salty? A: This 'trick' is used by many a fine chef.

"input: CONTEXT: The primary reason is definitely convenience. If you don't want skin and seeds in your sauce, then you have to do some work to avoid it. Yes, it's possible, e.g. passing through a food mill, or blanching and peeling plus retaining only the flesh, but having it already done is a whole lot easier.Passata is usually much thicker too, so it won't need as long a cooking time to reduce into a non-watery sauce as fresh tomatoes. On top of that, you don't have to worry about whether you can find good fresh tomatoes, e.g. if it's winter and they're out of season.Your two cases for comparison seem to overlook this: if you just chop and cook, you'll have skin and seeds in your sauce, as well as excess liquid to cook down, while if you use passata, you won't. (Also, for what it's worth, you'd need pretty giant tomatoes to get the equivalent of 3/4 cup of passata out of one tomato.)Of course, if you don't mind skin and seeds, it's also perfectly fine to simply cook fresh tomatoes and be done with it.Note that you can often get similar advantages from other canned tomato products. In the US, crushed tomatoes are far more common, and a roughly similar texture. (Peeled whole tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste can also be useful depending on what texture you're aiming for.)  <sep>  Q: What exactly is Passata? A: crushed tomatoes  Q: Is it better to use Passata instead of fresh tomatoes? A: The primary reason is definitely convenience  Q: Is the procedure that much more difficult to use fresh tomatoes instead of using Passata? A: f you don't want skin and seeds in your sauce, then you have to do some work to avoid it  Q: Fresh is usually better; however, is it really just a matter of convenience or is the taste effected?

To flavor carnitas all the way through, put them back in the braising liquid that has been reduced since cooking the pork.

"input: CONTEXT: Venison is, generally, an extremely lean meat. This means it responds well to two cooking methods: very very fast and very very hot (grilling, perhaps roasting with a lot of basting, or lard the meat first), or very very slow and moist (braising). This is of course dependent on the cut; loin is best grilled, shoulder is best braised (due to the connective tissue), leg is best roasted.I wouldn't use plain water as a braising liquid. 50/50 water and red wine, or stock and wine, or just stock... cider would be lovely, so would various juices.  <sep>  Q: How do I get good results with marinaded venison?###I had some deer ragout and let it marinade one day in wine, brandy and with some spices. ###Then I added some fresh vegetables, cold water and put the heat on.

"input: CONTEXT: It really depends on your audience and setting. With a Filipino Lechon, it's served communally and eaten as pulled pork, so it's expected that you'll just plunk it down on a side table, and people will crack through the crisp, almost hard, skin and pull servings for themselves with tongs or forks. And they'll go for the whole thing, skin, ears, jowls and all (most people I know don't eat the ears, but they may crunch the crispy skin off them).A similar thing is done with a country-style hog roast. Those may be skinned before serving, but generally you're responsible for pulling or slicing what you want right off the hog (and usually throwing it on a cheapo burger bun). In both of these settings there are almost always some people who don't want to dig right into the pig out of squeamishness or out of fear of getting some part that's not nice to eat. The good host will periodically pull some of the good stuff onto a platter for those folks.If you're doing something more formal, I guess you'd want to section it like Foodrules suggests.  <sep>  Q: How do I serve a whole pig?

"input: CONTEXT: I've never tried steaming bok choy, but yes, the ribs and leafy bits cook at different speeds.For stir frys I trim the bottom so the ribs come free, clean off any dirt that's gotten trapped in between, then stack up the leaves and cut the leaves from the ribs. I slice the ribs into about 5mm / 3/16"" slices, and add them towards the end; the leaves I cut into ribbons (perpendicular to the ribs), and stir them in at the last second, so they barely cook. The center I just chop the top off the leafy bit, and slice the more rib-like bits a litte larger than the rest of the ribs (they're thinner, so cook faster).As I've never tried steaming it, and I don't tend to cook in bags (except for silver turtles when camping), this is going to be a complete guess. Now, it tastes fine al dente, so you could leave the ribs as large as I use for a stir fry, but en papillote tends to be fancier cooking, so I'd probably try for maybe 1/6"" slices or a little thicker (maybe 2-3mm), and if you had a mandoline so they all came out even, that'd be great. I'd still cut the leaves into ribbons, just because it's easier to eat than a huge intact leaf.I'd assume that the leaves would cook at a similar rate as spinich, and the ribs closer to fennel, if that helps at all.  <sep>  Q: How should I prepare Bok Choy before I cook it? A: For stir frys I trim the bottom so the ribs come free, clean off any dirt that's gotten trapped in between, then stack up the leaves and cut the leaves from the ribs  Q: Are the leaves usable?

"input: CONTEXT: A bunch of spinach usually weighs something like 250-500 grams. My best guess is that something like half that is the stems, which can easily be as long as the leaves. So very roughly, I'd say a bunch is 125-250 grams. Alternately, if you want to go by volume (e.g. if your store has bulk loose baby spinach), think of a bunch as something like a head of lettuce, except with the bottom third to half mostly stems.Full-size spinach also definitely gets a lot better than 4x6 cm leaves, so you may still be using somewhat more tender baby spinach,Â but that of course won't cause you any problems. (The stems on baby spinach are tender enough to eat, especially when blending, so you can use everything in your bags.)In any case, smoothies are really forgiving - not only do you not need a lot of precision, but you can just add and blend until the color and flavor look how you want!  <sep>  Q: How much is a bunch of spinach?

"input: CONTEXT: Ripening of the avocado is slowed down greatly by refrigeration, so it is usually a good idea to let the avocado ripen fully at room temperature. Once it is ripe, it can be stored in the refrigerator for at least a week. This way, it is ready to use whenever you want it. Fortunately, there is a day or two when the avocado is ripe, but not too ripe, so if you check on it everyday when ripening, you will be able to save it at the correct ripeness without worrying about it too much.Putting an unripened avocado in the refrigerator may prevent it from ever ripening completely.

"input: CONTEXT: I would use any uncolored brandy made from distilled fruit. Himbeergeist, sliwowitz, or what you can lay your hands on. Kirsch doesn't taste much like cherries, and I suspect that it functions more as a solvent for some of the aroma in the spices than for adding its own taste. Even though it does contribute a bit, the taste will be subtle, and other slight fruity notes from a different fruit brandy will blend with the heavy spices just as well. In a pinch, you could use a colored brandy too, like Chantre. But it will add more of its own flavor, and while it can make a good combination, it will be further from the original than a random obstwasser. I would avoid any liqueurs, they will add way too much foreign taste, and also won't have enough alcohol to solve the spices in the same way.  <sep>  Q: What can I substitute for Kirsch in Leckerli (Basel Lackerli) cookies?

"input: CONTEXT: It is hard to tell from the picture, but this doesn't look like burned off seasoning, it is more like a burned on residue. If that's the case, you can try cleaning it some way. The problem is that physical cleaning methods probably won't be sufficient, chemical cleaning with alkali will damage the seasoning and chemical cleaning with acid, if the seasoning is compromised, can rust the pan a bit. So there is a high chance you will end up reseasoning. If this really looks and feels like a buildup and not like exposed oxidised metal, my preference would be to soak in warm, not hot, acid. Vinegar or a citric acid solution should work well. Afterwards, try to scrub off with a stiff plastic brush. If it doesn't go away, or the seasoning goes away too, or if this was missing seasoning from the beginning, you have to strip and reseason. We have several questions on the topic, and the Internet is also full of suggestions. I personally prefer doing it with lye (best results, strips both old seasoning and rust), owners of self-cleaning ovens like incinerating it, and there are a list of other methods to work with.  <sep>  Q: How do I recover from overheating my cast-iron skillet?

"input: CONTEXT: I'm not a professional fudger, but here is my theory: one should add it to the boiling mixture. The reason is that butter has milk solids that are said to âburnâ at low temperatures (somewhere in the range 120C-150C or 250F-300F) which just above the soft ball stage (113C or 235F) needed for making fudge. I interpret the burning to mean that those milk solids (sugars and proteins) get a chance to contribute to the Maillard reaction that gives caramel (and its grained cousin the fudge) its great and rich flavor. Given how unique and varied the flavors arising from butter are, I would not want to miss their contribution by adding them after the heat is gone.  <sep>  Q: How is butter used in fudge? A: one should add it to the boiling mixture  Q: My main question here is Why do some recipes put the butter ON the fudge once its hot whereas the professional videos (i.e. youtube mackinac fudge shops) seem to show the butter in the boiling mix?

"input: CONTEXT: On the question of dry ice, yes...it makes excellent ice cream using a kitchen aid and the beater in the standard bowl. It is best if you pulverize the dry ice in a blender first. You will want to avoid using too much (your base will become carbonated, but you can allow it to off-gas). Add a little at a time until the appropriate texture is achieved.

"input: CONTEXT: Allowing dough to rise twice results in a finer gluten structure than allowing it to rise once. It results in a smaller crumb and prevents huge gaping airholes in your bread. The reason that you have to let it re-rise is that you just pushed all the air out with the kneading you did developing that gluten structure.  <sep>  Q: Why let dough rise twice?

"input: CONTEXT: My understanding is that what many people call white chili would be considered a green chile stew in a place like New Mexico. It's not red in color because it doesn't have any significant amount of dried red chile in it--it gets whatever heat and chile flavor it has from green chile, which doesn't color the stew significantly.As to defining chili, I think you could work on a definition forever. Apart from the notion that a chile is the pepper, which is the main ingredient, and chili is the dish, I don't like to define it too carefully (of course, New Mexicans think the dish is chile too, but what they have is different from Texas chili, even when they use red chiles). I think chili is a stew, though. Most stew isn't chili, but all chili is stew. And I believe that for most people to accept what you're making as chili, it would have to include a significant dose of dried red chile powder.So if you can accept the validity of white chili at all, and what you're making has almost all green chiles and very little red chile, then I'd say you're making a white chili. Or a green chile stew--which would be my preferential term in this case.  <sep>  Q: What makes white chili white?

If that's the case, plunge the mold into an ice bath, but don't completely submerge it. Assuming your mold is metal (molten sugar is hot!) they will cool rather rapidly although I can't give you an exact time.In general, an ice bath is the way to go for rapid cooling. You could get it a little cooler by adding a generous dose of salt to the ice bath, but meh I think you'll only shave a few seconds.  <sep>  Q: Cooling melted sugar quickly?

"input: CONTEXT: It sounds very much like you didn't manage to completely dissolve the sugar. It's also possible to get a bad texture from ice crystals in your ice cream, but I don't think you'd describe it as gritty or sandy, just icy.It can be rather difficult to dissolve that much sugar in liquid, especially if it's cold straight from the fridge. You might want to try heating it gently and stirring, and being careful to go until there's no undissolved sugar hiding at the bottom. That does make the chilling take a bit longer, probably more like 4-8 hours or overnight, not just 1-2 hours. But in my experience heating to dissolve is pretty much standard in ice cream recipes, presumably because it's about the only way to do it easily.  <sep>  Q: My homemade ice cream texture is gritty/sandy, any advice?

"input: CONTEXT: Mast O Khiar, as you mention mainly consist of plain yogurt and cucumbers and most recipe do not require much more than that. Because of such, the shelf life for the yogurt product will be the shelf life of the yogurt itself. If it is a store bought yogurt, then the shelf life should be about 2 weeks in the refrigerator.Make sure to store the sauce in an air-tight container. Most tubberware should work. Those soup containers from Chinese takeout orders work perfectly.EDIT: After a bit of a debate in cooking chat, I decided to change my answer a little. The reason I said 2 week is because personally I had eaten 2 week old Mast O Khiar. However it could be recipe dependant so it could be different for a different recipe. However it is very easy to tell whether yogurt OR cucumber is bad.Mast O Khiar should have a very fresh/clean aroma. When yogurt turn bad, it releases a rancid smell. If it smells bad, dont eat it.If you see fuzzy mold it's a good idea to throw it out.  <sep>  Q: What is the shelf life of a yogurt product?

"input: CONTEXT: Gumbo is a creolized (blending of different cultures) dish that was really a way of making use of many whatever might be on hand. The word ""Gumbo"" itself comes from the African Bantu tribal language which uses the word ""Ngambo"" for okra. In the plantation culture of the south ""ngambo"" became ""gumbo"" and eventually came to be the word for a soup containing okra. In the deep south of South Carolina and southern Georgia it typically has Okra in it to provide thickening from the mucilaginous substance secreted from the okra.As people moved westward toward the Louisiana region they adopted the Choctaw Indian method of using ground sassafras leaves (gumbe file) as the preferred thickening method in that area. Sidenote: Gumbo file is considered to be the only indigenous north American spice.Without knowing what it is that you've been disappointed with, it's difficult to make suggestions. As with so many regional dishes there are certain consistencies but more often than not...more variations. This is one of those items where there isn't necessarily ONE primary method.Some gumbos use a roux for added depth of flavor, color, and thickening while others are more broth based.The main consistency is that it is typically served ladled over rice.  <sep>  Q: What is Gumbo?

"input: CONTEXT: A lot of sourdough recipes don't call for a sponge, per se, because the starter essentially already is a sponge. The purpose of a sponge in a bread with normal yeast is to allow a longer fermentation time and extra time for enzymatic reactions to happen in the flour before adding it to the final batch. This isn't necessary with sourdough the starter is continuously fermenting and reacting.

"input: CONTEXT: I'm sorry to say this, but I think prevention is the best answer. Once you're vegetables freeze things happen at the cellular level that changes the nature of the vegetables. For example, ice crystals pierce cell walls which destroys some of the structure, which is responsible for the crispness and crunch of the vegetable. I don't think there is really a way to ""fix"" this, once it happens.That said, cooking does something similar to vegetables. Cooking destroys cell walls, which is why cooked carrots are so much softer than raw carrots. I would think that vegetables that stand up to cooking would survive freezing the best (such as your mushrooms).

"input: CONTEXT: Some of your 'shortcuts' are not good ideas. Definitely start with cold water. Definitely bring up the temp slowly. Definitely do not boil. Do add aromatics upfront to the broth, but remove them as they get mushy so they don't cloud it.Standard ratio for beef broth would be: 8 pounds of bones to 6 quarts of water to 1 pound of veggies (onion, leek, carrot) to one 'boquet garni', essentially garlic, rosemary, anise flavoring for pho, and bay leaf, plus whatever else I forgot.If you have 'pond water', which I interpret as thin-tasting, you probably put too much water in the second time -- this is fixable by slowly evaporating out the water until it gets to a good texture. If you skimmed properly, it will be clear as you do this. I will typically strain through a kitchen towel or cheesecloth as the liquid evaporates down.I'm guessing you put in like a gallon of water, so you had like three or four times too much water.As a warning which you probably already know, you are not going to be able to duplicate your local pho joint's broth -- the broth recipe is the thing for pho makers, and they probably have a bunch of tricks they use, including using a neverending supply of yesterdays pho, that you won't be able to do at home.

"input: CONTEXT: The answer depends on where you live, and what type you have brought.In many countries that import chickpeas they heat treat them to kill seed-borne diseases and insects. The heat treatment process makes them more difficult to cook, and soaking times double or triple.Beans from exporters with phytosanitary certificates can be imported without heat treatment; these are the ones you want to get.I don't think you can tell which is which by looking at them. At the moment we have some particularly dark, dry, and dead looking beans that soak up beautifully in 8 hours!Soak non-heat treated beans for 8 to 12 hours, heat treated beans for 24 to 36 hours. Some overly heat treated beans will never fully revive, and you are best to return these to the shop as ""faulty"".Soak and cook without salt, unless you are going to mash them. They fall apart more readily if salted.If you are not mashing them, the secret to great chickpea taste is after soaking and cooking in water, is to lightly fry them with a little olive oil until dark spot appear, keep them or the pan moving so none burn.

However, if you are just looking at it as a simple binary system with water as the solvent and various sugars as solutes, one at a time, then there is a very simple answer (not necessarily useful alone).For dilute solutions, freezing point depression is primarily driven by the solvent and not so much the solute, and the relationship is linear. For sugars, Freezing Point Depression (Â°C) = 1.86 * MM is mass/molecular-mass of whichever sugar you use in 1000ml of water. For your example of 10g of sucrose in 100ml water, M is 0.29 and your freezing point is minus 0.5C.For disaccharides like sucrose and lactose, they have identical molecular mass of 342.

"input: CONTEXT: What to doA dough should be generally risen by size anyway, not by time. But it is also very forgiving, so it will probably still give you decent edible bread if you do it by time. The best way is to wait until it has doubled, no matter what the clock shows. But you insist on going by the clock, don't change the time, wait the 30 minutes. It may be underproofed (with such a short time given by the recipe, there is virtually no chance of overproofing it), but the same would have happened if you were using the original amounts and going by the clock. Dough proofing and timeThe rising time for dough at room temperature is not affected by recipe scaling, the time it takes a specific dough to double will be the same regardless of the size of your batch. If the temperature in your proofing container is significantly different from the dough temperature, you will see some effect on rising times with different batch sizes and dough shapes, as the center of the dough will need some time to get to the same temperature as the proofing container, and warmer dough rises quicker than cold dough. This is unlikely to have a measurable effect at dough amounts used by home bakers, especially considering that the possible proofing temperature window is rather narrow.  <sep>  Q: How does halving a bread recipe impact rising time?

If you are going to go for a cold infusion then it's highly recommended that you dry your chillies first so you get a long lasting result. If you don't dry them they will get mushy and rot in the oil, which isn't very pleasant. Drying them in your oven will stink up your house big-time, but it's worth it. Alternatively you can make chili strings with them and they will air dry, or you can freeze them for years and they'll stay good.  <sep>  Q: Can I Appropriate oil to infuse with hot chillies?

"input: CONTEXT: Moist salts are naturally harvested sea salts from which not all the water has been removed. They are noticeably wet, often caking up or forming more of a ""slush"" than a powder.Some aficionados only believe that sea salt is ""real"" and ""natural"" if it is moist. Me, I have enough humidity in the apartment.  <sep>  Q: What is a ""moist"" salt? A: Moist salts are naturally harvested sea salts from which not all the water has been removed  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: can you tell me anything else about it? ###

"input: CONTEXT: It really depends on your audience and setting. With a Filipino Lechon, it's served communally and eaten as pulled pork, so it's expected that you'll just plunk it down on a side table, and people will crack through the crisp, almost hard, skin and pull servings for themselves with tongs or forks. And they'll go for the whole thing, skin, ears, jowls and all (most people I know don't eat the ears, but they may crunch the crispy skin off them).A similar thing is done with a country-style hog roast. Those may be skinned before serving, but generally you're responsible for pulling or slicing what you want right off the hog (and usually throwing it on a cheapo burger bun). In both of these settings there are almost always some people who don't want to dig right into the pig out of squeamishness or out of fear of getting some part that's not nice to eat. The good host will periodically pull some of the good stuff onto a platter for those folks.If you're doing something more formal, I guess you'd want to section it like Foodrules suggests.  <sep>  Q: What is the best process to serve a whole pre-cooked pig I got from the butchers? A: It really depends on your audience and setting  Q: Is there a lot of butchering involved? A: you're responsible for pulling or slicing what you want right off the hog  Q: So each guest pulls off what they want at the table? or do I need to do in advance for them? A: generally you're responsible for pulling or slicing what you want right off the hog  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Do I need to reheat the pig before serving or serve it right out of the box at room temperature?
output: ",No
"input: CONTEXT: You are better off making the crumpets in advance and then reheating them. The rising agent in crumpets is usually bicarbonate of soda or baking powder, and so the batter can't be 'held' in the fridge like a yeasted batter - it would be very dense if you left it too long.So, make the crumpets, then reheat them. I'd suggest using the toaster - this is how crumpets are sold and prepared in the UK. Make sure you have plenty of salted butter on hand too!  <sep>  Q: Can I make crumpet batter in advance?

"input: CONTEXT: If you whisk egg whites to much they will definitely separate.Basically you are over tightening their stretchy proteins which squeeze out all the water. You are left with useless protein fluff floating on water.The flavor and odor will not change, however. That would be a sign off spoiling and unrelated to the whisking.  <sep>  Q: Is it possible to whisk egg whites too much?
output: ",Yes
"input: CONTEXT: Don't most cake recipes require mixing dry ingredients first? Well, what's been done has been done.The standard professional chef way of getting lumps out of anything is to pass it through a fine strainer. In your case a standard metal pasta strainer should work. Put the strainer over a bowl, pour the batter in and use the back of a large spoon or ladle to gentle press the batter through. The lumps of sugar will be left over and you can just crush them then.Whipping the batter might work the gluten proteins in the flour which will make for a tough chewy texture. Some cakes actually take this into account and others it is bad, so be careful.  <sep>  Q: What can I do with batter that has lumpy sugar in it? A: you can just crush them  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: I already tried beating it on high speed, but there's still lumps, so how can I smash them all?
output: ",Yes
"input: CONTEXT: There are many kitchen utensils which will work. My favorite will be canning jars, filled with some water so they don't float, and sealed. Food safe, can withstand the temperature, easily cleaned. One may be enough, if you find the perfect size. If you don't have them and want to try it with something else first, look in your kitchen for metal or ceramic vessels which can stand upright and are several centimeters taller than the sauce level after displacement. This can be a thermos flask without the cap, or even a tall mug. Just put it there, again fill with some water, and fill the sauce around it. The biggest risk is that it topples over, and you end up with a somewhat watery sauce.  <sep>  Q: Ways to displace liquids while cooking A: There are many kitchen utensils which will work. My favorite will be canning jars  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: What can I use that won't displace the flavor?
output: ",Yes
"input: CONTEXT: It's safe because freezing greatly slows (if not completely arrests) the growth of the bacteria that would otherwise make the meat spoil. It doesn't kill them, it just puts them in 'stasis'. The expiration date is given based on the meat only being refrigerated. If you intend to store the meat past its expiration date, best practice is to freeze the meat ASAP, and to use it within 24 hours of defrosting.The main hazard is in that defrosting. At no point should the chicken (any part thereof) be at room temperature for more than 2 hours. The safest method is to defrost the meat slowly in the fridge. You can also defrost it under cold running water, providing you keep it under the 2 hour mark.Of course, you can also cook the meat straight from frozen. There is absolutely nothing wrong with doing this for small cuts like chicken breasts. Slicing and cooking a partially defrosted chicken breast is perfectly safe, especially as it often easier to make really thin strips with semi-solid meat. You just have to be extra careful that the meat is at a safe temperature (170Â°F/75Â°C).  <sep>  Q: Why is expired frozen chicken safe to eat? A: It's safe because freezing greatly slows (if not completely arrests) the growth of the bacteria that would otherwise make the meat spoil  Q: Are there any food safety hazards to watch out for when defrosting expired frozen chicken? A: The main hazard is in that defrosting. At no point should the chicken (any part thereof) be at room temperature for more than 2 hours  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Thank you for the information. How long can expired chicken be kept in the freezer?

"input: CONTEXT: You could try using a different types of sugar with your soy sauce, perhaps palm sugar. This has that different flavor that your probably looking for. This is also the type of sugar that is commonly used when cooking in Southeast Asian foods, such as Indonesian food. Also the type of soy sauce you are using in the first place, You might want to try a Thai or Filipino style soy sauce, different flavor components. These are probably closer to the Indonesian taste, than say Japanese soy sauces. I find them sweeter and not as salty. Just as an aside, are you finding it difficult to find this sauce? Or do you just want to try making your own?  <sep>  Q: What other sauces have an Indonesian flavor?

"input: CONTEXT: If you heated the eggs above 160Â°F/70Â°C (and boiling is definitely above that), they're cooked, and any harmful bacteria has been killed. Can't say for sure that you did this without knowing the steps you performed.Given, if it doesn't taste good, and it was cheap ingredients... sounds like an argument to discard it anyway. Even if its perfectly safe.(Note: lower temperatures will also kill the bacteria, but it's no longer instantâyou may have to hold it for a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the temperature.)  <sep>  Q: Custard Pudding tasting like raw eggs A: if it doesn't taste good, and it was cheap ingredients... sounds like an argument to discard it  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: It was hot enough to burn my tongue.

"input: CONTEXT: If you mean cleaning in terms of getting rid of the 'beard', use clean pliers and a lot of elbow grease. It's hard to pull that out.If you mean just cleaning the shells, use a stiff bristled brush and scrub.If you mean cleaning the sand from the inside of the mussels, put the live mussels in a large container full of water and cornmeal and leave overnight in the refrigerator. The mussels should flush the sand out and replace it with cornmeal (never tried this method, but I've heard it works well.)  <sep>  Q: What is the best way to clean mussels? A: f you mean cleaning the sand from the inside of the mussels, put the live mussels in a large container full of water and cornmeal and leave overnight in the refrigerator  Q: I've tried scrapping with a knife (scissors), but it's hard work and slow.

"input: CONTEXT: If your chicken burns, the issue is likely not that you cooked it too long, but that you cooked it too hot. How long to cook it depends on the total amount of meat, the size of pieces that it is in (anything from bite sizes pieces for a stir fry up to an entire chicken), and how you're cooking it - oven, saute pan, braising ...Roasting in the oven or braising in a stew are generally the most ignorable techniques - if you overcook a roast it may dry out, but won't burn, and if you overcook a stew the meat (especially chicken) may dissolve into shreds but burning is less likely.Since undercooked chicken can be unsafe, you should choose cooking techniques that are sure to fully cook the chicken without burning it.  <sep>  Q: How long is too long to cook chicken?

"input: CONTEXT: If you were using supermarket cream, the reason would be very clear: it is not only pasteurized, but also homogenized. This means that it has been mechanically emulsified to prevent the butter from separating. I don't know if the cream for creme fraiche is homogenized too before creme fraiche is made, but with your result, I'd suspect homogenization too. It won't show up on the label as an ingredient, as it is done by forcing the cream through microfilters.  <sep>  Q: Why might I have trouble making butter from CrÃ¨me FraÃ®che? A: If you were using supermarket cream, the reason would be very clear: it is not only pasteurized, but also homogenized  Q: ahh, that makes sense. what would i want to use to make sure it comes out right?

"input: CONTEXT: Advance warning: I haven't tried this.It seems that you don't want to remove the ovaries because that would affect the shape, but you do want to remove the capsaicin from them. It's soluble in fat and alcohol, so you could try making a small hole in the bottom and pumping a light vegetable oil or vodka through from the other end using a syringe. Obviously you're likely to end up with some solvent trapped inside, and you might also wash away some of the flavours you're trying to preserve, so experimentation would be necessary.  <sep>  Q: How can I make fresh chili peppers less hot? A: e, but you do want to remove the capsaicin from them  Q: I want to keep the flavor, but how do I remove or offset the actual heat? A: It's soluble in fat and alcohol, so you could try making a small hole in the bottom and pumping a light vegetable oil or vodka through from the other end using a syringe  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: How should I cook them after putting vegetable oil or vodka in them?

"input: CONTEXT: It was timing. If you want to make chocolate meringues, add the cocoa powder to the liquid egg whites, and then whisk it all together at once. Beaten egg whites are bubbles. Don't add things to an already-formed meringue, as they will just cause the bubble structure to collapse.Ever sprinkled sugar or cinnamon powder on a cappuccino? Notice how the milk foam immediately collapses? The same thing happened to your meringue.  <sep>  Q: What caused my meringue to fall after adding cocoa?

"input: CONTEXT: This seems nonsensical to try with your home stove. You are correct, the rate of gas output is directly controlled by the knobs. In a typical home stove, drilling holes will not increase the gas output. It would affect the gas to air ratio, but I doubt it would result in an increase of temperature, and more likely a decrease.  <sep>  Q: Can you tell me a gas hack for greater output? A: to try with your home stove  Q: Yes, certainly. But, I need a hack to try working on it. Do you know any? A: This seems nonsensical to try with your home stove  Q: So, it doesn't work?

"input: CONTEXT: There's no particular reason you couldn't prepare a stock with something other than water, but it's the equivalent of buying a ream of heavy pink paper, rather than plain white photocopy paper. If that's the effect you really want, great. The thing is, stock is meant to be as boring as plain white photocopy paper -- it is a foundation for other things, versatile and effective, subtly enhancing without overwhelming the dish. For your beer idea, for example, I would cook down a couple bottles and add some stock to it. That way, the rest of my batch of stock would be useful for other recipes that don't use beer.Note that stock may be boring but shouldn't be flavorless; stock still should taste good. If your stock was flavorless, try upping the amount of meat, veggies, and herbs compared to bones. Also, bear in mind that stock should not contain salt (you will likely reduce the stock at some point). The lack of salt, however, will deaden the flavor. When you are ready to use the stock, be sure to add a pinch of salt.  <sep>  Q: Can I use other liquid than water when making stock? A: There's no particular reason you couldn't prepare a stock with something other than water  Q: Would it be weird to use lager?

"input: CONTEXT: The key to this is really high heat and pan-fry in a single layer, very quickly. The goal is to get that nice brown caramelized surface and barely cook the interior and then get it out of the pan before it starts to seep water.

"input: CONTEXT: I think on some level you'll just get what you get with something hard like an almond. A really really sharp knife with a thin blade can help, but you can only do so much. My hand-cut ones are always a bit on the raggedy side.When using a food processor, try smaller batches to leave bigger or more consistent pieces. You don't have to pulse as long to get everything broken up, so you get less that's ground to nothing. Do a small batch for a short chop, dump 'em out, do another.As to how to do slivered or sliced almonds, I always figured that they started with blanched almonds (which are less crisp in my experience) or maybe even raw ones and then roasted them after cutting to crisp them up. You might experiment with blanched or unroasted almonds and see if you get a better result with a knife.  <sep>  Q: How can I take apart almonds?
