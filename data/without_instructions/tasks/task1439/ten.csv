"input: CONTEXT: I always submerged mine in warm water and, bare handed, worked the cap until it came free. The water should dissolve the salt with the help of the mechanical action. That was with glass bottoms and metal tops. You should be able to brute force your full metal shaker with no ill effect as the metal will have a much higher shear strength than the salt that is binding it.  <sep>  Q: have you untwist a salt shaker before? A: I always submerged mine in warm water and, bare handed, worked the cap until it came free  Q: I can try that but is there a better way? A: The water should dissolve the salt with the help of the mechanical action  Q: Hmm, would it be a good idea to use pliers to pry it open? A: You should be able to brute force your full metal shaker with no ill effect as the metal will have a much higher shear strength than the salt that is binding it  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: that's a good explanation. What is shear strenght?

"input: CONTEXT: Apparently the chicken haddie plant had fire damage and we have not been able to buy it for over a year now in New Brunswick, Canada. I too grew up with it for making the best fish cakes. Anyway, the plant is up and running again as of January 2012 and I've been buying at Sobeys.  <sep>  Q: Are chicken haddies still available? A: the plant is up and running again as of January 2012  Q: Where exactly is it located? A: New Brunswick, Canada  Q: Do you know exactly what companie?###companies*? A: I've been buying at Sobeys  Q: Do you get good ones over there? A: I too grew up with it for making the best fish cakes  Q: Have you ever tried its chowder?

"input: CONTEXT: I make bacon and other cured meats frequently. I find that the amount of liquid released from pork belly varies. That is not a useful measure of how the cure is proceeding. Bacon, in particular, is usually cooked after the cure, so I don't worry too much. I use the salt-box method, coat the belly in cure mixture, place in large zip lock, place in container slightly larger than belly and put in fridge. Flip every day or so for a week. What I look for next is a firming up of the belly. I pinch it. If it has firmed up after a week, I move on to hot smoking (or you could use your oven). If it still feels soft, I give it another day or two.  <sep>  Q: How much juice should come out when I'm curing pork belly? A: I find that the amount of liquid released from pork belly varies  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: My latest batch has extracted less than half of the juice of the first two. Is this normal?

"input: CONTEXT: You are making Gianduja - and if you make chocolates out of it, they're Giandujotti - singular form Giandujotto; The name might help you find sources of information.The tempering process will be basically the same (I've seen sources suggest 2Â°C below temperatures for white chocolate temperatures at all times), but keep in mind that it won't be as melt resistant and as such not particularly good for enrobing.  <sep>  Q: What Effect of liquified hazelnuts on chocolate tempering?

"input: CONTEXT: Well, you don't need to spend hundreds of dollars, but you might need to put in more elbow grease. You can get a hand-crank meat grinder for about $30 or so and a manual sausage stuffer for about the same. You could save on the grinder if you have a food processor or blender that can have its way with the meat.  <sep>  Q: How do you make homemade sausage without meat grinder/sausage stuffer?### A: Well  Q: No, I don't. A: You can get a hand-crank meat grinder for about $30 or so and a manual sausage stuffer for about the same  Q: What do you mean by elbow grease?###Can I use a food processor? A: You could save on the grinder if you have a food processor or blender that can have its way with the meat.  Q: What else can I do besides buying a machine I will barely use? A: a food processor or blender  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: How would I stuff the sausage without a stuffer?
output: ",Yes
"input: CONTEXT: Traditionally, mozzarella is sold extremely fresh - as in made that day or the day before. If it's held for more than a day or so, it comes packaged in a brine. Most of the American stuff is just too soft to be held for packaging like other shredded cheese in the mega-mart.In the US, being extreme gluttons for convenience, we tend to make do with part-skim shredded mozzarella instead of the good stuff. Slight temperature variations can make the shreds stick together in a globby mass. It's harmless from a safety point of view, and the expiry date can be long after the occurrence of perfectly safe globbiness.Pro-Tip: Put the globby pieces in the freezer for 20 minutes, and then shred it like a block of harder cheese. Upon heating, it will melt (almost) as if the the globbiness had never happened. I have taken advantage of a few good sales that way. Mozzarella will become... ehem... colorful before it becomes unsafe. While this answer is more for mozzerella than for other types of cheese; the last paragraph works for any mega-mart shredded cheese.  <sep>  Q: Why would unopened shredded cheese get soggy in the fridge? A: Slight temperature variations can make the shreds stick together in a globby mass  Q: Is this normal? A: It's harmless from a safety point of view  Q: Is it safe to use the soggy parts? A: It's harmless from a safety point of view, and the expiry date can be long after the occurrence of perfectly safe globbiness  Q: How can I prevent this from happening? A: Put the globby pieces in the freezer for 20 minutes, and then shred it like a block of harder cheese  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: How should I store these shredded cheeses if I want to buy them when they are on sale and use them later on?

"input: CONTEXT: As commented by SAJ14SAJ, you can dust the apple pieces with some of the cake mix. There is no need to change the proportions asked for by the cake mix box. You also do not need to cook the apples ahead, but you can slice them quite thinly or cut in small pieces to ensure that they are cooked enough.  <sep>  Q: I'm using a spice cake mix. I know how to keep the apple bits evenly spaced by using flour, should I increase the liquid because of the flour? A: There is no need to change the proportions asked for by the cake mix box  Q: Should I cook the apples (at least partially) before dusting and adding or will the cook enough when baking the cake? A: do not need to cook the apples ahead  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Will the flour make the apples taste flour-y?
output: ",No
"input: CONTEXT: This seems nonsensical to try with your home stove. You are correct, the rate of gas output is directly controlled by the knobs. In a typical home stove, drilling holes will not increase the gas output. It would affect the gas to air ratio, but I doubt it would result in an increase of temperature, and more likely a decrease.  <sep>  Q: Can you tell me a gas hack for greater output? A: to try with your home stove  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Yes, certainly. But, I need a hack to try working on it. Do you know any?

"input: CONTEXT: For several years, I've been putting canola in a plastic squeeze spray bottle and using that.I do not recommend 'vegatable' oil, which in the USA is usually 100% soy oil and I have found that it gums up and can leave a difficult to clean residueYes, my system can apply too much and do so unevenly too. just use a paper towel to wipe off ecess and even out.Far cheaper with canola priced at about $5 per US gallon versus 8 oz of generic aerosol spray at $1.99  <sep>  Q: How do I make homemade cooking spray? A: For several years, I've been putting canola in a plastic squeeze spray bottle and using that  Q: Are there alternatives to canola? A: I do not recommend 'vegatable' oil, which in the USA is usually 100% soy oil  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Does the spray bottle get gummed up?

"input: CONTEXT: I've never used bhut jolokias but I love spicy vegetable oil. DO NOT just throw the peppers in a jar of oil. Apparently this is bad. Follow the much more helpful links in the comments that follow this and make the oil properly.Once you do this you can cook pretty much anything that needs a little (or a lot) of extra heat. You said you have other peppers so it might be interesting to set up a few jars with different pepper combos.Bonus: if what I've heard of these peppers is correct, you can probably make a low grade mace this way.If you're looking for something to do right away, I'd mix a very small piece in some melty cheese and throw it on some chips, burritos, pizza, or anything really. Spicy cheese rocks.Good luck and enjoy.  <sep>  Q: What can I do with Bhut Jolokia's?
output: ",Yes
