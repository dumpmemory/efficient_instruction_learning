"input:  Person1:     How do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ?  
 Person2:  I think that the public transport system could be made simpler . I never know where the bus routes actually go . The routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line .  
 Person1:      I think we just need to build more roads . Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams .  
 Person2:  If we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . I think we should discourage people from using their cars .  
 Person1:      How would you do that ?  
 Person2:  I think we should do a few things at once . Improving public transport would encourage people to use that . If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much .  
 Person1:      I don ’ t know . I think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money . They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax , for example .  
 Person2:  I think that they should pay more tax . Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes .  
 Person1:      The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . It well be unpopular .  
 Person2:  That ’ s a good point . Car owners will probably be against it , but people who use public transport will be in favor of it .

 Person2:  OK , the cost depends on the floor to move to , the distance between two places and the amount of the furniture to move .  
 Person1:      How much will it cost in that case ?  
 Person2:  Oh , let me see . It fits the second standard rates . Have a look at the contract , please .  
 Person1:      Your charge is divided into two parts , the Payment in Advance and the rest . I thought that I should pay all of it before moving .  
 Person2:  No , firstly we sign the contract ; you pay 50 % of what it costs , and the rest when we finish moving .  
 Person1:      The damage and compensation item confuses me . Could you give some explanation ?  
 Person2:  OK . If any of the articles was damaged during moving , you may make a claim for compensation with our department .

"input:  Person1:     what's your apartment like ?  
 Person2:  it's furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus .  
 Person1:      what is it like living in on-campus housing ?  
 Person2:  it's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it .  
 Person1:      did you have to pay a deposit ?  
 Person2:  no , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month .  
 Person1:      do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ?  
 Person2:  no , it's all included . Besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here .

 Person2:  that's the bad thing---the contract ends in June , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon .

"input:  Person1:     Well , we've settled the problems of price , quality and quantity . What mode of payment do you wish to employ ?  
 Person2:  Irrevocable letter of credit , of course . It's the normal terms of payment in international business .  
 Person1:      Could you adopt D / A or D / P ? You see I have to pay a deposit when I open a letter of credit . That will tie up my funds and add to the cost of my imports , especially for such a huge order .  
 Person2:  You might consult your bank and see if you could reduce the required deposit to a minimum .  
 Person1:      Anyhow , there would be certain bank charges . We've done business for years and you should have some faith in our credit . It would help me greatly , if you could accept D / A or D / P . It makes no difference to you , but it does to me .  
 Person2:  Well . As you understand , the irrevocable L / C gives the exports additional protection of the banker ’ s guarantee . We always ask for L / C for our exports , and the other way around , we pay by L / C for our imports . We only accept L / C for regular orders .
