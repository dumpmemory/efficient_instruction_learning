 Person2:  In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . In writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page .  
 Person1:      Oh , now I see what you mean . When you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something !  
 Person2:  A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . Don ’ t you think so ?  
 Person1:      I think I see what you mean . I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can ’ t write it .  
 Person2:  Exactly .  
 Person1:      So I have another question for you . What do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ?  
 Person2:  They ’ re both harder than reading or writing .  
 Person1:      In what way ?  
 Person2:  Because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of English .  
 Person1:      You are making me feel really discouraged .
