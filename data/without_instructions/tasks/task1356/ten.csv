"input: The device will be marketed in partnership with the local internet retail giant JD.com. The team behind the Nokia 6 phone said the handset's ""premium design"" would appeal to the local market. The announcement coincided with the final day of the CES tech show in Las Vegas, where other new mobile phones and gadgets have been launched. Nokia no longer manufactures phones that carry its name but has instead licensed its brand to another Finnish company, HMD Global. Until now, the only phones that had been released under the deal had been more basic ""feature phone"" models. The Android device had been highly anticipated and marks Nokia's return to the smartphone market after a series of Windows Phone models. Nokia also briefly sold Android-based handsets - known as Nokia X - in 2014. Microsoft used Nokia's brand for a short time after buying the company's mobile devices the same year, but later referred to the devices solely by their Lumia name. Mobile World Congress Nokia once dominated the mobile phone market but struggled after the launch of the iPhone a decade ago, and the subsequent release of Google's Android operating system. HMD Global had previously indicated it would release several Nokia-branded Android phones in 2017. It is expected to provide details of at least some of the other launches at another trade show - Barcelona's Mobile World Congress - in February. ""The decision by HMD to launch its first Android smartphone into China is a reflection of the desire to meet the real world needs of consumers in different markets around the world,"" the firm said in a statement. ""With over 552 million smartphone users in China in 2016, a figure that is predicted to grow to more than 593 million users by 2017, it is a strategically important market where premium design and quality is highly valued by consumers."" The Nokia 6 phone runs Android 7.0 - the latest version, also known as Nougat - and features: The specifications are mid-range, and so is the price: 1,699 yuan ($245; £200). That makes it slightly more expensive than Huawei's Honor 6X but cheaper than Xiaomi's Mi 5s. ""Nokia remains one of the most recognised mobile phone brands on the planet,"" commented Ben Wood from the CCS Insight technology consultancy. ""HMD Global will be hoping it can capitalise on this as it seeks to relaunch Nokia devices in 2017. ""It will be hoping the brand will help it stand out in the incredibly crowded Android smartphone market, which is characterised by cut-throat competition and a sea of design sameness. "" Brandon Ackroyd, Head of Customer Insight at Tiger Mobiles believes that Nokia will launch the Nokia 6 globally if the device has a successful launch in Asia. ""If the Nokia 6 performs well in China then it's highly likely we will see a new international variant of the handset sometime in 2017. We'll be keeping our eyes on the certification websites in the coming months looking for a variant with more connectivity options like GSM, LTE, and CDMA that will make the device compatible with networks worldwide.""

"input: President Donald Trump said Mr Mnuchin had spent his career making money in the private sector and would now work for the taxpayer. Mr Mnuchin pledged to create jobs and combat terrorist financing. Democrats had argued that Mr Mnuchin had made a fortune foreclosing on families during the financial crisis. The top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, Maxine Waters of California, called Mr Mnuchin ""the foreclosure king"". His critics have also questioned whether he is too close to the Wall Street banking community, which he will be responsible for regulating. Democrats also complained that Mr Mnuchin had failed to disclose nearly $100m (£79m) in assets when he filed with the Senate Finance Committee. Mr Mnuchin spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before becoming a hedge fund manager. He later founded a film production company that was behind such box office hits as the X-Men franchise and American Sniper. Mr Trump said Mr Mnuchin would help make the US a ""jobs magnet"". ""He'll work 24 hours a day, I know him. He'll work 28 hours a day if they give him the extra four hours,"" he said. Another former Goldman executive, Gary Cohn, is the director of President Trump's National Economic Council. What do we know about the new treasury secretary's policy plans? Mr Mnuchin hasn't announced a fully fledged plan, but his responses in media interviews and during the Senate debate over his appointment make clear some of his priorities: There are still many policy areas that have not been addressed, including how he will approach trading relations with China, Mexico and other partners.

"input: The director of Dissapearance Committee told BBC Sandehaya that the Committee has received information of over fifty cases of disappearance in recent weeks. “The protesters urged President Mahinda Rajapaksa to immediate attention to these abductions while security is tightened in Colombo,” KVJ Dayanan said. The government appointed a retired judge, Mahanama Thilakaratne, in September to investigate the abductions, but so far no report has been submitted. Last month, the Asian Human Rights Commission accused the government of abducting suspected rebels. The government has denied any involvement. The Sri Lankan Human Rights Commission said at least four hundred Tamil youths have gone missing from the northern Jaffna peninsula since December. The Tamil Tigers have also been accused of abducting civilians by human rights groups.

"input: The competition will be held at the Perthshire resort in 2014, the first time it has been held on Scottish soil almost 40 years. Aberdonian golfer Paul Lawrie handed the trophy over to Gleneagles Chief Executive Patrick Elsmie to mark the countdown to the event. Scotland's economy is expected benefit by £100m by hosting the Ryder Cup. Lawrie, who played a key role in helping the European team to retain the Ryder Cup at Medinah at the weekend, made the stop at Gleneagles before making his way to St Andrew's for the Dunhill Links Championship which begins on Thursday. Spurring event He said was delighted to see the cup return to Scotland: ""This is the home of golf and it somehow feels right to be taking the trophy, and all it represents, to Gleneagles. ""I have never experienced anything like that final day in Medinah, but being involved has spurred me on to hopefully play a part in Team Europe at Gleneagles 2014. ""It will be a really special event and I hope I can do enough to be in contention."" Patrick Elsmie, managing director of Gleneagles, said it was an honour to host the Ryder Cup: ""The Medinah Country Club set an incredibly high bar in hosting a truly memorable Ryder Cup, but the scenes in Chicago also demonstrated just why we were so keen to host this amazing sporting event. ""Seeing the trophy here at Gleneagles today brings home the fact that it's Scotland's turn next, and that the countdown to the 2014 Matches has begun. ""It is going to be a wonderful time for Scotland, and we at Gleneagles will ensure the tradition, class and theatre of The Ryder Cup are celebrated in style."" Economic boost The event is expected to be one of the largest ever hosted in the country with the Scottish government spending about £20m to stage the match. It is anticipated that over the week of the competition an additional £100 million will come into the Scottish economy. About 250,000 people are expected to travel to Perthshire to attend the event, with an estimated half a billion households watching it on television. Ryder Cup Director Richard Hills said: ""Medinah was epic and has given Scotland a real taste of what to expect in two years' time. Bringing the trophy back to the Home of Golf is the perfect way to continue Team Europe's celebrations."" First Minister Alex Salmond said the arrival of the cup meant that the countdown to the 2014 tournament had begun. Increased expectations Mr Salmond said: ""The Ryder Cup is going to bring enormous economic benefits to Scotland. ""Before last weekend in Medinah it was estimated that 2014 would pump £100m into the local and wider Scottish economy during the tournament week alone. ""However, last weekend showed us that the Ryder Cup continues to grow in scale tournament-by-tournament. Scotland's Ryder Cup in 2014 is now likely to be even bigger than we have anticipated up to now.""

"input: Net profit for the three months to September fell to $4.47bn (£2.79bn), from $5.74bn a year earlier, and missed expectations. Total revenues fell 8% to $16bn. PC sales fell as consumers either put off new purchases in a tight economy or opted for tablet devices instead. Microsoft deferred a total of $1.36bn of revenue, which it will regain in the following quarter. This included $783m in licence fees for PCs pre-loaded with Windows 8, because it cannot recognise the revenue until the units go on sale on 26 October. It also deferred $384m for PCs that shipped with Windows 7 but are eligible for a $15 upgrade to Windows 8, and $189m for PCs that shipped with the new version of Office or are eligible for an upgrade. Microsoft shares fell 3% in extended trading.

"input: The proposals are designed to replace a current grass pitch on the Crichton Estate in Dumfries. The Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland has voiced concerns about the impact on the landscape. However, planning officers say that is outweighed by the potential economic and community benefits. The £410,000 scheme is a joint project between Dumfries and Galloway College, Dumfries and Galloway Council and the Crichton Development Company. It has received grant support from Sport Scotland. If the scheme receives planning permission a new pitch, fencing and floodlights would be built at Hospital Park, the home ground of South of Scotland League side Crichton FC.

"input: Fox wants to buy the 61% of Sky it does not already own. But it faces regulatory problems after the Competition and Markets Authority found the £11.7bn deal was not in the public interest. Fox had already pledged to ensure the independence of Sky News. The Murdoch family's news outlets are currently consumed by nearly a third of the UK's population across TV, radio, online and newspapers. The Murdoch Family Trust controls News Corporation, which publishes newspapers including the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times. Sky was the top gainer on the FTSE 100 in early afternoon trading on Tuesday, with shares up about 2%. What is the ring-fencing proposal? Under the proposed new deal, the news channel would become a distinct company within Sky, run by the head of Sky News. Funding for Sky News would also be guaranteed for 15 years. Previously, Fox had said it would be funded for 10 years. The executive chairmen of Sky, Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, and the chief executive, Chase Carey, would not try to influence editorial decisions made by the head of Sky News, according to a statement by 21st Century Fox. The company had already proposed remedies to the CMA's concerns, including having an independent board for Sky News. However, critics of that proposal, including politicians such as Ed Miliband, Vince Cable and Kenneth Clarke, had said that the head of Sky News would still be appointed by the head of 21st Century Fox and so could be influenced by the Murdochs. Fox hit back at those politicians on Tuesday, saying their assertions were ""unsupported and fanciful"". What is the new Disney proposal? Fox also proposed selling off Sky News to Disney, whether or not Disney's proposed acquisition of Fox goes through. Disney's proposed takeover of 21st Century Fox, which has yet to be approved by regulators, includes Fox's current 39% stake in Sky. Even if that takeover gets knocked back, Sky News would still be sold off under the new proposal. Disney chief executive Bob Iger is keen on Sky and has said he is ""committed"" to Sky News, which is loss-making. US media giant Comcast has also thrown its hat into the ring for Sky with a £22.1bn bid in February. Comcast has a broadband division serving 29 million US customers. It also owns NBC and Universal Pictures and wants to buy a majority stake in Sky. What do Sky shareholders think of the proposals? Analysis: Simon Jack, business editor This is great news for Sky shareholders. If Sky News is sold to Disney or legally separated from the rest of Sky, then the thorny issue of Murdoch control over Sky News - to add to the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times - is finally laid to rest. What we will then have is a straight shoot out between 21st Century Fox and US rival Comcast to acquire Sky. A proper auction between those two bidders will mean a higher price for Sky. Currently Fox is offering £10.75 per share and Comcast has indicated it would be prepared to bid £12.50. Directors at Sky are pretty confident that Fox will have to come in with a better offer. At that point, we will see how serious Comcast really is in its bid to derail Rupert Murdoch's carefully laid plans to sell Fox to Disney and effectively dismantle a media empire it has taken a lifetime to build.

"input: The victim, named locally as Ozell Pemberton, 16, was found injured at about 15:30 BST on Thursday at Lower Parade in the main shopping area of Sutton Coldfield, north of Birmingham. West Midlands Police said the suspect handed himself into a police station in the early hours and remains in custody. The attack reportedly took place near a McDonald's and a group of bus stops. Police said there had been disorder in the area at the time and several people were seen fleeing. The ambulance service said despite its ""tremendous efforts"", Ozell was confirmed dead at the scene. Police said he has has not yet been formally identified and a post-mortem examination will be held in due course. But a tribute to Ozell was released by his former school earlier. ""We were deeply saddened to hear about the tragic death of one of our former pupils and our thoughts and prayers are with his family,"" a spokesperson for Greenwood Academy, Castle Vale, said. ""For our part, we are providing counselling and support to our pupils and staff to help them through this difficult time."" Staff said he last attended the school in November 2015. Councillor David Pears, who represents the Sutton Trinity ward, described the violence as ""appalling"". He added: ""My sympathies go out to this person's family and their friends. ""I think people want to feel safe; it's really important that police take action very quickly."" Analysis by Sima Kotecha, BBC Midlands correspondent Unfortunately fatal stabbings in Birmingham are nothing new. This crime happened in the affluent area of Sutton Coldfield and in the middle of the afternoon. The age of the victim is also unnerving; just 16 and killed as a result of what officers call ""disorder"" involving several people. At a time when police resources are stretched in the region and crime rates are soaring, there is a palpable fear among some residents who are repeatedly saying that they just don't feel safe anymore. That fear is particularly prevalent among the older generation, but the victims in many of these violent cases are young men and boys. @sima_kotecha Part of Lower Parade remains sealed off for investigations to be carried out. West Midlands Police Assistant Chief Constable, Alex Murray, said: ""This is a tragic set of circumstances and our thoughts, and I'm sure the thoughts of everyone in the community, are with the boy's family at this truly devastating time. ""A dedicated team of homicide detectives has worked non-stop on the investigation since yesterday and has made good progress."" Mr Murray added: ""We need parents, community leaders, schools and young people themselves to pass the message that it is never OK to carry or use a knife."" David Jamieson, the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, said ""much more needs to be done"". ""This is another stark reminder of the importance and responsibility we all have in ending violence in our communities,"" he said. Mr Jamieson said he was spending an extra £2m ""tackling violence"" over the next two years. Knife crime in the West Midlands Source: West Midlands Police Related Internet Links West Midlands Police

"input: Muller said ""an unprecedented 25% surge"" in farm milk production since 2014 meant supply was now ""substantially"" outstripping demand. A month-long review with its 230 Scottish suppliers concluded that the situation was ""unviable"". It will now give 14 dairy farms in Aberdeenshire 12 months' notice. Muller said the suppliers were based in areas which presented ""heightened or complex logistical transport challenges"" for the company. In a statement, the milk processor also announced plans to introduce a tiered transport charge for suppliers in Scotland from February. Muller had warned its suppliers that the growing milk surplus was not sustainable and had ""significant environmental consequences."" It said surplus milk was currently being transported to England, resulting in more than 6,000 tanker movements travelling a total of 2.5 million miles each year. Rob Hutchison, from Muller Milk and Ingredients, said: ""We fully appreciate that these measures will be extremely unwelcome and destabilising for our farmer suppliers particularly in the north east of Scotland, but the current situation is unviable and we must act. ""We completed the largest single investment in fresh milk processing in Scotland in more than a decade at our dairy in Bellshill last year and we will continue to do what we can to stimulate new demand for fresh milk. ""But with fresh milk already in 96% of the nation's fridges and overall consumer demand for the product in marginal decline, the reality is that it is extremely unlikely that this sector will soak up the heightened levels of milk production from farms which we have seen."" 'Devastating news' Commenting on the announcement, NFU Scotland president Andrew McCornick said it was ""clearly devastating news"". He added: ""Given the considerable commitment and investment made by dairy farmers, we now have producers looking to find a new buyer in the next year if they wish to continue milking cows while others, through haulage charges, face a significant cut in income at a time when milk prices are struggling to cover the cost of production."" Last month, Muller announced the closure of its Aberdeen depot with the loss of up to 45 jobs. Muller's distribution, garage, tanker and retail operations in the city had been the focus of a 30-day consultation process. The company said the decision was ""against a backdrop of declining consumption of fresh milk and significant changes in retailing"".

"input: Half of those consulted by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said patient care was compromised by insufficient staffing on their most recent shift. The claims emerged in a submission to Holyrood's health committee on the 2018/19 draft budget. The Scottish government said the number of nurses and midwives had significantly increased since 2012. It is also committed to increasing the number of training places for health care workers, Health Secretary Shona Robison added. However the report is the latest in a series of warnings over staffing issues in Scotland's health service. The RCN's submission was based on the preliminary results of a survey of 3,300 nurses and health care support workers from across Scotland. Of those who said high quality care had been affected by staff shortages, a third said there were not enough registered nurses. A quarter said there were inadequate numbers of health care support workers and nearly half had concerns about the mix of skills on their last shift. Other findings include: The RCN used their report to call for more support for the healthcare workforce. It said: ""There needs to be recognition of the fact that people are the NHS' greatest resource and that investment in workforce will have a positive impact for patients, as well as seeing improvements in areas like sickness rates and retention."" And it added: ""The RCN recognises the Scottish government's commitment to scrapping the 1% pay cap for NHS staff, but unless staff are appropriately remunerated, as well as being given the time and support to develop, issues around recruitment and retention within nursing teams will persist."" The RCN will publish more detailed analysis of the survey results later in the summer. 'Damning insight' The findings have led to further claims that morale among health care staff is at ""rock bottom"" and nurses are being ""stretched to breaking point"". Scottish Labour health spokesman Anas Sarwar said: ""This is a deeply worrying revelation. ""It reinforces our warnings that the SNP has presided over a workforce crisis in our NHS, leaving staff over-worked, under-valued and under-resourced. ""Morale is at rock bottom in the health service, with staff reporting there simply aren't enough of them to do the job properly. That risks compromising patient safety. ""This is part of the legacy left by Nicola Sturgeon who as health secretary slashed the number of training places for nurses and midwives. ""As a result, spending on agency nurses in Scotland has risen six-fold in just five years under the SNP, which is just one reason why our health service is in desperate need for a meaningful workforce plan."" Serious concerns Alex Cole-Hamilton, the Scottish Liberal Democrat's health spokesman, described it as a ""damning insight"" into the state of Scotland's NHS. He added: ""Our nurses within the NHS work incredibly hard but it is clear they are being stretched to breaking point. ""The SNP need to step in immediately and make sure that our wards are fully staffed. ""That starts by scrapping the NHS pay cap and give staff the resources and support they need to do their jobs. "" The Scottish Conservative's Miles Briggs said hospitals were being hit by the SNP government's ""horrendous lack of forward planning"". ""This is more damning evidence of that mismanagement, and it comes from those who know best,"" he added. ""We have warned the Scottish government for years that there aren't enough nurses working currently, and there aren't enough coming through the system. ""This falls completely on the SNP's head, and it must act swiftly to address these very serious concerns."" 'Safe staffing' Shona Robison, the cabinet secretary for health, defended the government's record. She said: ""There are over 3,300 more whole time equivalent nursing and midwifery staff working in our NHS compared to five years ago. This year we have also increased nursing and midwifery training places by 4.7%, bringing the total number of places available in 2017-18 to 3,360. ""For the last five years, this government has made consecutive increases to the number of student nurse training places. ""We're working with health boards to reduce the overall use of agency staff, including by establishing regional and national staff banks - which allows health boards greater access to a pool of highly-skilled, flexible NHS staff. Last year, agency nursing represented just 0.4% of the total NHS nursing workforce."" She added: ""Our recently published NHS workforce plan also sets out a commitment to delivering around 2,600 additional nursing and midwifery training places by the end of this Parliament, as part of a wide-ranging set of measures to support and sustain our workforce. ""In addition to this we have committed to enshrine safe staffing in law and are currently considering the responses we received to the recently closed consultation on this.""
