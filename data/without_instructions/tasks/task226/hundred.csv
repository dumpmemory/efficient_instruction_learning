"input: Question: Most grammar checkers are capable of detecting the the misuse of ""your"" and ""you're""; providing the necessary correction. I'm curious though, is there any sentence that can be constructed where replacing ""your"" with ""you're"" keeps the sentence grammatically correct, but changes the meaning? If this is not possible, what grammar rules are in place that prevents these edge cases from occurring? 
Answer: a. I love you and your bananas. b. I love you and you're bananas. This particular case depends on the your/you're coming after an independent clause followed by ""and,"" since its feasibility depends on functioning either as a second direct object or as another independent clause. It also depends on the noun serving either as a thing that someone might be in possession of (the bananas we eat) or as an adjective or noun complement describing a person (bananas=crazy). Easiest if that noun is plural or uncountable. The same sentence could be constructed with nuts, garbage, and other nouns which I'll let you brainstorm because my stormer hurts. You can also (and thanks to @Barmar for drawing attention to this) use verbs, in which case they act as a gerund with the possessive pronoun and a present participle with the ""you're."" As in: a. I love you and your cooking. b. I love you and you're cooking. Or: a. I despise you and your smoking. b. I despise you and you're smoking.

"input: Question: I was told in a Latin class that the name Christopher has Greek roots that mean ""one who carries Christ"". I assume that the Latin connection here is fero, which is the verb to carry. With that in mind, does the name Jennifer have a similar derivation? If so what would she be carrying? 
Answer: It's a perfect example of a false cognate pair that is created by a sort of linguistic homogenization. When we come across foreign words, we pronounce them with our own sounds, mapping a foreign sound to one natural to our own ear that seems close enough for our purposes. Unrelated sounds and syllables from unrelated languages might in this way each get mapped to a single native sound/syllable. In this way, we come to hear the sounds and syllables as related when they are not. Mesoamerican languages, for instance, did not have a ""v"" sound. Consequently, when learning Spanish, the natives of Central America had a devil of time with the fairly common v sound and ended up usually pronouncing it as a b. The b sound is related to the v sound, so it wasn't a subtle shift. In consequence, very often to this day words like ""votar"" (to vote) get pronounced identically with words like ""botar"" (to throw out) giving rise to numerous puns. When native Spanish speakers from Latin America learn English, they are often heard saying things like ""Thank you bery much,"" as a result. But ""bery,"" and its false homophones ""berry"" and ""bury"" have no shared ancestry. As a last point of interest, consider English spelling. It is so difficult precisely because speakers of English and the academic sources that safeguard the English language (Oxford English Dictionary, Merriam-Webster Dictionary, etc.) have made a general decision to preserve as best as possible the original spelling of the words in their original languages, making only occasional modifications to bring them into some kind of conventional conformity. So the Greek suffix - is conventionally transliterated as -pher, whereas the ending of Gwenhwyfar gets transliterated as -fer and the ending of aquifer stays as the Romans wrote it: -fer. This makes our spelling a bear to get a handle of, but it also locks the secret of most words' origins right into the words themselves. That means, once one has understood a bit of Latin, Greek, some common Celtic endings and a bit of German, one can almost always discern the origins of the word just by looking at it. Of course, it also means that we have to spend years and years memorizing spelling word lists and still relying on spellchecker far more than we care to admit.

"input: Question: Possible Duplicate: Types of things vs. types of thing When using the phrase ""types of"" or ""kinds of,"" it often seems appropriate to follow with a singular noun (e.g., types of rock), but at other times a plural noun sounds better (e.g., types of sentences). Is there some kind of rule about this? 
Answer: Here's a rule of thumb with which to decide the correct usage in any given case. Turn the phrase around: I like all kinds of music = I like music of all kinds I like all kinds of apple = I like apple of all kinds I like all kinds of apples = I like apples of all kinds And so on.

"input: Question: This is a question for English wordsmiths. Is there a word that ""feels"" like the word ""ethereal"" that means something ethereal that quickly disappears. Or is ""ethereal"" the correct word choice for this? Ethereal was the first word that popped into my head for this. From the various definitions that I've looked at for ethereal, it says delicate, beautiful, heavenly, etc. but not necessarily quickly vanishing, except for the secondary definitions related to ether that suggests it evaporates. I'm just wondering if there is a better word than this. I'm using the term ""ethereal skill"" to describe a certain type of pilot skill (instrument flying) that requires tremendous practice to achieve proficiency, and once proficiency is achieved it is a beautiful thing, but if you don't practice it regularly, that skill vanishes after a few weeks. USAGE: Instrument proficiency is an ethereal skill that once obtained must be maintained through constant and regular practice. 
Answer: evanescent is a good match - definitions focus on loss and vaporous qualities. It seems to be applied most often to the loss of things with positive connotation. MW defines it with : ""tending to vanish like vapor"", Cambridge with ""lasting for only a short time, then disappearing quickly and being forgotten"" Century Dictionary Online has a number of useful definitions and quotes. I like ""Vanishing or apt to vanish or be dissipated, like vapor; passing away; fleeting: as, the pleasures and joys of life are evanescent. Also from Century, this quote: ""He [Wordsworth] seems to have caught and fixed forever in immutable grace the most evanescent and intangible of our intuitions, the very ripple-marks on the remotest shores of being."" - Lowell, Among my Books.

"input: Question: Wikipedia says: A postscript may be a sentence, a paragraph, or occasionally many paragraphs added to, often hastily and incidentally, after the signature of a letter or (sometimes) the main body of an essay or book. When all letters were handwritten, and adding a new thought to the letter would have likely involved rewriting the entire letter, a postscript had obvious practicality. Now, however, one can just as easily add the thought to the main text. 
Answer: You seem to have answered your own question, but it's perhaps worth pointing out that in both email and conventional mail a postscript can be a consciously chosen device for drawing attention to what it contains. What might look like an afterthought to the reader might be a deliberate ploy by the writer.

"input: Question: I want to ask whether I can use the word ""Fuck"" in a formal context. Apparently, the word dates back to the early 16th century, so it shouldn't be considered slang (although, it is misused as slang for other reasons), but regardless of its vulgarity, could I use it in a formal context with its original definition? I imagine that people will be surprised, but when realizing in what context I am using it in, then it will be more understandable and acceptable to use it. Firstly, I do not even know the definition of the word due to its vastness in meaning, I always thought it was an exclamation-like word meaning nothing (for it to mean sexual activities is a slang definition, is that not correct?), but used purely for emphasis. What does it first and foremost mean in its original/accurate and/or formal definition? I also know of another definition of the word ""Fuck,"" which is ""I will fuck you"" as in ""I will defeat you"" (in context of fighting or combat), is that a formal definition as well? I mainly ask for this, because I need to use the word in this context, specifically and especially. Also, side question, is it possible not to always make it a vulgar word? Thanks in advance. 
Answer: It is very unwise to use ""fuck"" in any formal context whatsover (outside of technical discussion of language). The word either has strong and forceful sexual meaning, or it has the debased banality of over-frequent use by those groups of society who lack nuances and who express themselves repetitively and coarsely. In neither case does the usage fit with formal discourse. In short, although an excellent word to describe a very pleasant and necessary activity, it is rude.

"input: Question: I've found that expression on a website, and I don't understand it. At first I thought it was because the canary is yellow and the coal black... but it doesn't make much sense. 
Answer: Miners used canaries to detect carbon monoxide and other gases in the mines. As long as the canaries continued to sing, the miners were safe. If the canary died, they'd evacuate the miners. I didn't see a reference included in your posting so lacking the context of the quote, I'd go out on a limb to say that what is meant is either literally a reference to that practice of gas detection or it is some sort of metaphor for some sort of early warning system as in the example below. An example of how this expression can be used metaphorically, from wisegeek.com: ""Today, the practice of using a bird to test the air supply has become part of coal mining lore, but the ideology behind it has become a popular expression. The phrase ""living like a canary in a coal mine"" often refers to serving as a warning to others. The actual canary had little control over its fate, but it continued to sing anyway. In one sense, living this way indicates a willingness to experience life's dangers without compromise."".

"input: Question: I know that Sussex and Middlesex are in England. It looks to me as if there is a pattern in names. What does the suffix -sex mean? Where does it come from? 
Answer: The -sex suffix is from Anglo-Saxon / Old English, with the actual meaning being ""Saxon"". Sussex is essentially ""South Saxon"". Middlesex is ""Middle Saxon"". Essex is ""East Saxon"". Wessex is ""West Saxon"". Most of the wiki pages for these places will have the toponymy definition.

"input: Question: ""The worst student"" is the student who is bad at things. In this case, ""worst"" simply describes the noun. Following this logic, your ""worst enemy"" would be the person who is very bad at being your enemy, thus is actually your best friend. Your ""worst enemy"" is actually the enemy who is very good at being your enemy. Thus, in this context, ""worst"" acts to amplify the inherent negative intent of the noun. ""Worst disaster"" would be another example of this. Is this just a matter of context or there some science behind the interprettation of a negative adjective applied to a negative noun? 
Answer: Don't confuse English language with the mathematical theory. The adjective worst qualifies the noun enemy with even more bad values. So, a worst enemy is more dangerous than a normal enemy.

"input: Question: We were discussing something like pre-boss era, post-boss era. What word describes the era where the boss is still there? 
Answer: Peri-boss era. This prefix allows you to create delightfully clear parallel construction that covers all cases: pre-, before peri-, during post-, after Google [ pre- post- peri- ] for examples ""in the wild"". These prefixes are popular in medical terminology, such as pre-, peri-, and post-anesthesia.

"input: Question: The question is quite straightforward: Which of the following is preferable? ""I keep myself up-to-date on the latest technology."" ""I keep myself up to date on the latest technology."" 
Answer: The simple answer is that the non-hyphenated version is more appropriate - and more commonly used - in the example sentence that you give. The hyphenated version is more commonly seen as a compound adjective, sometimes as a jargon phrase. Indeed, I have seen it used as a perjorative, sarcastic term, although that is not common usage. So in summary, up-to-date is used as an adjective describing a condition or status of an object or document, while up to date is used to describe a state of mind or a fashion.

"input: Question: Whenever I hear statements like ""It was a great deal for he and I"" and ""Call Karen and I in the morning,"" I die a little. Such solecisms, as Twain said in another context (Cooper's prose style), ""grate upon the fastidious ear."" Moreover, I know that these things will likely become accepted usage in time, if that hasn't already happened. As someone who tries to be careful with words and speech, I feel almost a moral obligation to hold the line against this kind of decline. I'm not a word snob; I say ""ain't"" when it works for emphasis, and so on. I've tried suggesting the grammatical alternative to the above constructions, but even when I phrase my suggestion in the gentlest possible way it never works well and I almost always wind up feeling pedantic and priggish at best, and at worst I feel I've alienated someone. What's the general opinion here? Is it best to just let these things slide or to take up the fight? In sum, is there a good way to promote good grammar, or at least protect it from the most egregious violations? 
Answer: There is nothing wrong with having gut reactions to the way that people say things. I am completely aware that the standard/educated version of a language is arbitrary (i.e. is no more ""correct"" in any real sense than any dialect), and even still, I have pet peeves and things that irk me about people's language usage. I think these are unavoidable, just like my reaction to certain fashion choices that people make in their outfits. But, like with fashion, there is very little objective truth to my judgment about any of it. I try not to actually challenge people on uses that bother me; aside from the arbitrariness of language, every bit of evidence suggests that stopping language change in any significant way is like going to the beach and trying to stop the tide from coming in. There was a more in-depth discussion about this in a previous question. That said, I do believe there is a certain time and place where standards and clarity are important. In formal contexts, information is often supposed to be presented in a certain way, and, generally, these conventions benefit everyone. Also, following certain language conventions in these situations can eliminate ambiguity. If I am asked to proofread an academic paper that my colleague has written, I would make corrections for things that I would never object to otherwise.

Answer: Food in its commonest sense is a non-countable noun, with all the effects of that. It's already a plural. You would eat ""some food"" not ""a food"". You would say ""less food"" not ""fewer foods"". However, there is a less common usage where ""a food"" means ""a type of food"": ""Cheese is a food made from milk"" ... and in this form, you can pluralise it ...

Answer: ""It is me"" is ungrammatical. Transitive verbs, like speak take a subject and an object. Thus, You (subject) will speak to me. (object) The verb to be is not transitive, but copular. It takes a subject and predicate. Thus, It (subject) is I. (predicate) Also, it must be We'll soon find out who (subject) is who (predicate.) rather than We'll soon find out who (subject) is whom (object.) Edit: Please see @krubo's excellent answer below.

There seems to be two camps: The word plethora indicates plural, so therefore it should be ""There are a plethora""; and the other camp says that there is only one plethora (which contains multiple), so it should be ""There is a plethora"". I've seen many examples of both. Is there a consensus, or is it just one of those things that can go either way? 
Answer: A plethora is singular, so one must say ""there is a plethora of..."" just as one would say ""there is a bunch..."" If you are dealing in several plethoras, you could use the plural: ""there are plethoras of..."" but this feels very contrived and artificial.

"input: Question: The US emergency telephone number 911 seems to be almost always pronounced as nine one one whereas the Porsche model is typically pronounced as nine eleven One reason I can think of for preferring ""nine one one"" for the phone number is that there is no ""eleven"" key on a phone. On the other hand, ""0800"" is often pronounced ""o eight hundred"". Is there a logical or historical reason for the different pronunciations? 
Answer: How a car manufacturer names its models is more of a marketing preference than anything, but in general you'll find that the Porche model is the norm. Ask any schoolchild to read aloud the number ""911"" and you'll get ""nine hundred and eleven"", not ""nine one one"". The telephone number 9-1-1 was, as you speculated, spelled out specifically to prevent people - particularly children - from getting confused looking for the ""eleven"" key on the telephone. I have heard this anecdotally countless times, but I'm having a hard time finding an authoritative source. Closest I can come are various ""history of 911"" websites like this one: Dr. Phil Shaenman, head of the U.S. Fire Administration's research department, authored a paper explaining that children should be taught to dial ""nine-one-one,"" and not ""nine-eleven.""

"input: Question: Is there a single word to describe birds that can fly? Am I struggling to think of a word because the default notion of a bird is that it can fly? So we generally only need to differentiate the ones that can't fly. I've seen the term ""winged"" in a few google searches, but to my mind an ostrich is winged, but it is also flightless. I guess I'm looking for the word you'd put into this blank: Penguins are flightless because they cannot fly. Ostriches are flightless because they cannot fly. Pigeons are ____ because they can fly. 
Answer: I think you can just use flying to describe them; flying birds sounds perfectly normal and isn't a tautology, nor does it only apply to birds in the air, cf. the title of the Wikipedia article 'Flying and gliding animals'. It's obviously an awkward choice for your example sentence, where another option, volant, could be used instead: 2: flying or capable of flying (source: Merriam-Webster).

Answer: There is a common acronym for this, used in computing and engineering, which is COTS - ""commercial off-the-shelf"" - i.e. you can buy it ready made without having to do any research to invent it yourself, and without needing to understand every detail of how it works. It is rather old, but COTS technology.

"input: Question: Possible Duplicate: This question has been asked at/on SO? Which sentence is grammatically correct? The papers are freely available at the journal website. The papers are freely available on the journal website. Using Google's search results: available at the website returns 72,800,000 results. available on the website returns 106,000,000 results. So, I inferred that both variants are popular. Is this method (comparing the number of results by Googling) sound? 
Answer: Speaking as a longtime computer geek, files are said to reside on a hard drive or on a certain machine. Since I know that a website is made of computer files, I think of a website as being on a machine and so any part of the website is also on that machine. A website's ""address"" is a ""Uniform Resource Locator"" or URL. These terms connote the idea of website as ""place"". In this case the file would be at the website location. So, if you think of a website as it is actually constructed (files stored on hard drives), you will probably say on. If you think in the location metaphor, you will probably say at. Personally I find myself saying ""on"" to other geeks and falling into ""at"" when speaking with normal people.

"input: Question: On a Physics specification, it says: 6.7 Know how to use two permanent magnets to produce a uniform magnetic field pattern. Isn't it ""produce an uniform magnetic field"", or is the existing ""produce a uniform magnetic field pattern"" correct? 
Answer: The word uniform begins with a palatal approximant /j/. The palatal approximant is a consonantal sound, even though the letter itself is a vowel. Since we use the pronunciation of the word following the article to determine whether we use ""a"" or ""an"", and because it is pronounced starting with a consonant, we use ""a"". Thus, the original sentence is correct. Just for the sake of completeness, the letter ""u"" can also have a vowel sound, such as in the word ""umbrella"", which begins with an open-mid back unrounded vowel //.

"input: Question: Is the word ""Customizable"" a valid English word? Every time I write that word, the spell checker underlines it, and it suggests using ""Customization"" or ""Customize"". I'm not a native English speaker, but that word exists in online dictionaries so I wonder why the spell checker underlines it. 
Answer: The Oxford English Dictionary in its revision of March 2012 defines it as: That may be customized; able to be changed to suit the requirements of the user. Frequently with reference to computer software and hardware. The earliest citation is from 1960. If that definition of customizable suits your purpose, then there's no reason why you shouldn't use it.

"input: Question: Is it correct to say ""Wish you a happy weekend"" or should I say ""Wishing you a happy weekend""? 
Answer: Neither Wishing you a happy weekend nor Wish you a happy weekend would be used in normal conversation. As others have noted, spoken parting platitudes at the end of a week are normally started with have, such as: Have a good weekend Have a nice weekend etc. Change the adjective to be what you think most appropriate for the situation. On the other hand, if you are signing off some correspondence, such as an email, then Wishing you a happy weekend is more appropriate. Similar constructions include Wishing you a happy birthday Wishing you a merry Christmas Wishing you well To use *Wish you a happy weekend you need to add I to make the sentence grammatical. i.e. I wish you a happy weekend. A notable exception to this is the common postcard sign off Wish you were here where it is idiomatic to leave out the I.

"input: Question: I was googling the reason for why it's called ""shotgun"" to ride beside the driver when it suddenly hit me - why on Earth is the firearm called ""shotgun""?! Is there any other kind of a gun than one used for shooting?! Why is it called ""shotgun"" instead of just a ""gun"" or a more technical term (9-gauge, barrel gun etc.)?

Transmit -> Xmit Transfer -> Xfer I am interested to know what is the origin of this. I am curious because ""Ex"" and ""Trans"" do not have a similar sound. 
Answer: In addition to the other edifying answers and comments: from an information-theory viewpoint, given the rarity of initial ""x"" in English words, the presence of it (especially if unpronounceable) is a clear signal that there is something at play slightly out of the ordinary, and it will not be easily mistaken for anything else. That is, information-theory-wise, the chance of misunderstanding is low (more technically/precisely, the error-correction properties of this usage are excellent).

"input: Question: It is common in American English to refer to a powerful person or organization as an 800 pound gorilla. The expression makes sense -- a gorilla of that size would certainly be intimidating -- but what's so special about the number 800? Searching ""n lb gorilla"" on Google for various values of n results in many more hits when n = 800 than when n is any other quantity. Also, the Google Ngram Viewer finds notable occurrences of the phrase ""800 pound gorilla"" in texts starting around the late 1970s; other sized gorillas don't seem to be mentioned at all. The Wikipedia entry for the idiom claims that the phrase is rooted in a riddle (""Where does an 800lb gorilla sleep?""), but that's just passing the buck. A 700lb or 900lb gorilla would be equally entitled to sleep wherever he wants to. Interestingly, the Wikipedia entry for gorilla states that the average male gorilla weighs about 400lb, occasionally reaching 500lb in the wild. Only obese gorillas in captivity have attained weights of 600lb. So the number doesn't even seem to be related to gorilla biology (except that it is safely larger than any known gorilla, save King Kong). Given that it's an arbitrary figure, is there any reason the number 800 would be more popular than any other? More generally, is there any relevant research into why some numbers would be more popular or pleasing than other in contexts like this? 
Answer: Quite large gorillas in the wild are at most 550 pounds; so an 800 pound gorilla is one that's oversized, even fat. As Wikipedia states, this phrase first originated with a riddle, ""Where does an 800 pound gorilla sleep?"" Ans: ""Anywhere it wants."" Because this is the standard idiom, when people want to speak hyperbolically they will sometimes exaggerate the number to ""1,000 pound gorilla"", or some other, even larger number. In short: no, the number 800 does not have any special significance, except perhaps with reference to the typical (male) gorilla's average weight (450 pounds).

Answer: Are you sure to delete this item? Sure means ""certain, without doubt"". Therefore this asks if they are definitely going to delete the item. This isn't something to ask the user; if anything it's something for the user to ask about the program; ""will it definitely be gone"". Are you sure you want to delete this item?

"input: Question: is it 'a usual' or 'an usual'? 'A usual' sounds more correct in my head ('Today was a usual day.') than 'an usual', but u is a vowel. Which one is correct and why? 
Answer: Usual (pronounced /ju.u.l/ as in you) begins with a consonant sound and, as such, it should be preceded by a not an. As an aside, I cannot help but point out that the sentence Today was a usual day is not usually heard in regular conversation. Today was an unusual day is what one might hear, instead! Indeed, I rarely hear the construction a usual. The definite article is more commonly used, in my experience: That's the usual thing. In place of a usual, one would also be more likely to hear not an unusual: Today was a usual day / Today was not an unusual day This is a usual occurrence / This is not an unusal occurrence or This usually happens You are right in saying that a usual sounds weird. As speakers, we tend to avoid constructions which, though correct, do not flow easily from the mouth. In sum, the following are valid and commonly used alternatives: not [an] unusual the usual usually.

"input: Question: There is a person in my current daily life who never admits his wrongs. He is always quick to blame others first and always believes that he is not wrong. Even when he is proven wrong, he still believes he shouldn't be sorry and isn't wrong. Is there a single-word adjective to describe this behavior? If not, a better way to describe this person would also make do. While stubborn and irresponsible fit, I feel like they don't tell the whole story. By this, I mean if I were to say to others that he is very stubborn and irresponsible, it is not implicitly implied that he blames others and never acknowledges his own fault. Edit: I believe my question is different because the person will also never acknowledge their wrongdoing. On top of blaming others, even after it has been proven to be their fault, they will not admit wrong doing. So aside from blaming others, they refuse to acknowledge the possibility that they have committed a mistake. 
Answer: If he calls attention to the same thing when someone else does it, the word would be hypocrite. Otherwise, weasel seems to have the connotation (when I hear it used) of falsely accusing someone in order to avoid being found out, though I don't see that specified in the definition.

"input: Question: How did 7 come to be an abbreviation for 'and' in Old English? is a beautiful question about the Tiroian ""et"", which is now the """" character 1. My question is what impact did the association of this 7-like-glyph have on the eventual placement of keyboards placing the & on Shift+7 combination? The Wikipedia article on the QUERTY keyboard shows that the ampersand was a separate key in the bottom left of the keyboard in the original patent application drawings. The patent was filed in 1878. The Das Keyboard blog shows a Full Duplex keyboard (with separate keys for upper and lower case letters) from 1897 with no ampersand key at all. I have not yet been able to find a reference to the first keyboard to place the ampersand and 7 together. The Wiki article on the ampersand only mentions that it is usually keyed via Shift+7, but occasionally on 6 or 8 instead. Dvorak layouts appear to share similar associations between 7 and &. So is it a coincidence? Or is there some association? 1 This looks really different in the EL&U site fontface. See the linked question or the Wikipedia article for more faithful renderings. 
Answer: Although the 7 was the ampersand on IBM's standard keyboard layout, that is hardly universal. The first nine printable characters in ASCII are ! "" # $ % & ' ( ), which should give a good clue as to what the top row of a teletype keyboard looked like. On many early teletypes and terminals (and also, BTW, on the Apple ][), the shift key toggled bit 4 of the character being produced, thus it would turn a 1 (011 0001) into ! (010 0001), and , (010 1100) into < (011 1100). Since the digits 1-9 received consecutive code, so did the characters produced by combining them with the shift key. Shift-7 on those keyboards was apostrophe; the ampersand was shift-6. Other typewriter keyboards also varied considerably in where they put the ampersand. Its association with the number 7 is nowhere near as consistent as the association between 1 and !, 3 and #, 4 and $, or 5 and % which existed in both older computer keyboards and today's US arrangement.

But I don't have any idea how can I write a proper email with such a greeting in English? Or do I have to ignore it because the email is kinda formal? 
Answer: I almost always start formal e-mails with Dear Professor _, I hope this note finds you well. Some guidelines will suggest ending your salutation with a colon rather than a comma, but in many circumstances a comma is acceptable. If the person's title is ""professor,"" you should spell it out (not ""prof."") and begin it with a capital letter when it precedes the person's name (as it would in your example). ""I hope this note (or letter) finds you well"" politely establishes a friendly connection between you and the recipient of your letter and in most circumstances is a great way to start it. Especially if you're asking for something, it's good to indicate your concern for the person you're writing to. For the same reason, it's a good idea to end the letter with a phrase or sentence that will similarly show interest in their work or their well-being. ""Best regards,"" is fine, but if you can tailor it in a way that's a bit more thoughtful, it's better. ""I hope your book/project continues to go smoothly."" (This can be followed by a ""Best regards."") If this is a person you don't know, you may have to settle for a generic ""Best regards"" alone.

Answer: As everybody has said, to take a stab at means to attempt. I want to additionally note here that I believe it to be related to the idiom stab in the dark, meaning an attempt at something with little guidance or hope of success. It doesn't carry the full weight of that meaning, though, just an attenuated implication of not necessarily knowing what one is doing, more likely used as mild self-deprecating humor than anything else.

"input: Question: I was told in a Latin class that the name Christopher has Greek roots that mean ""one who carries Christ"". I assume that the Latin connection here is fero, which is the verb to carry. With that in mind, does the name Jennifer have a similar derivation? If so what would she be carrying? 
Answer: No Jennifer is from From a Cornish form of the Welsh name Gwenhwyfar (see GUINEVERE). This name has only been common outside of Cornwall since the beginning of the 20th century, after it was featured in George Bernard Shaw's play 'The Doctor's Dilemma' (1906). GUINEVERE From the Norman French form of the Welsh name Gwenhwyfar, composed of the elements gwen meaning ""fair, white"" and hwyfar meaning ""smooth"". In Arthurian legend she was the beautiful wife of King Arthur who engaged in an adulterous affair with Sir Lancelot. Her betrayal of her husband with Mordred prompted the battle of Camlann, which led to the deaths of both Mordred and Arthur. The Cornish form of this name, Jennifer, has become popular in the English-speaking world.

"input: Question: What's the difference in meaning between ""register"" and ""registry""? Can both be used interchangeably when talking about an official (public) list of items, records? 
Answer: The online oxford dict says: Register noun official list or record, for example of births, marriages, and deaths, of shipping, or of historic places. a book or record of attendance, for example of students in a class or school or guests in a hotel. Registry: noun (plural registries) a place or office where registers or records are kept. But yeah, it also says that a registry too can mean a list. And I think 'Registry' is used more in the former context than the later. Even while talking in context of computers we say things like 'Windows Registry'. For me, the word register brings along a sense of being finite but registry does not. like when I think of a register of records, I usually get a quantified picture of the records list comes to my mind, like a page, or a notebook. but 'registry' brings along a picture of non quantifiable !! or its just weird with me.

Answer: ""finishing"" means reaching the end of some process, ""finalizing"" means declaring the end of some process. After finishing, nothing needs to be done any more, after finalizing, nothing is to be done any more. Finishing a specification means ending the process of drafting it, finalizing a specification means ending the process of refining it into a state fit for formal adoption.

Example: ""He likes to contrast his checkered jacket with plain pants"" or ""his checkered jacket contrasts with his plain pants."" But when we say ""in contrast to"", it is behaving as a noun.

I was under the impression that farthest is strictly speaking in terms of distance, whereas furthest is more abstract. A poster on this forum gives the following example: The further [quantity] you walk, the farther [distance] you get. What gives? 
Answer: The NOAD I had on my Mac Mini reported the following note, which is the same note found on the Oxford Living Dictionaries about farther and farthest. Traditionally, farther and farthest were used in referring to physical distance: the falls were still two or three miles farther up the path. Further and furthest were restricted to figurative or abstract senses: we decided to consider the matter further. Although farther and farthest are still restricted to measurable distances, further and furthest are now common in both senses: put those plants the furthest from the window.

In my understanding, off of should usually be replaced by off, as in, I took the book off the shelf as opposed to I took the book off of the shelf Am I wrong? Or is there perhaps some simple way I can explain this to most people? 
Answer: How can I explain to people that the phrase ""off of"" is grammatically incorrect? You can't, because it's not. There are thousands of examples of ""off of"" in the Corpus of Contemporary American English, not just in spoken English, but in magazines, newspapers, and academic journals as well. ""Off of"" is well-established as standard in American English. Plain ""off"" may be stylistically preferable in many cases, but it is simply not a rule of English grammar that if a word could be removed it must be removed. Some people seem to think that such a rule exists. It does not.

"input: Question: Whenever I hear statements like ""It was a great deal for he and I"" and ""Call Karen and I in the morning,"" I die a little. Such solecisms, as Twain said in another context (Cooper's prose style), ""grate upon the fastidious ear."" Moreover, I know that these things will likely become accepted usage in time, if that hasn't already happened. As someone who tries to be careful with words and speech, I feel almost a moral obligation to hold the line against this kind of decline. I'm not a word snob; I say ""ain't"" when it works for emphasis, and so on. I've tried suggesting the grammatical alternative to the above constructions, but even when I phrase my suggestion in the gentlest possible way it never works well and I almost always wind up feeling pedantic and priggish at best, and at worst I feel I've alienated someone. What's the general opinion here? Is it best to just let these things slide or to take up the fight? In sum, is there a good way to promote good grammar, or at least protect it from the most egregious violations? 
Answer: Does the grammatical faux pas compromise or endanger the communication, or is it merely annoying? (Annoying to you personally, of course. The speaker, and no doubt many others are perfectly happy with it.) Language can be a delight, but it is also, and to many, merely a means to an end. If you are with friends who enjoy language for its own sake and who want to improve their understanding and usage of it, a courteous and appropriate correction will be appreciated. If you are with strangers or persons with whom you have only a business relationship, then as long as the communication is not jeopardized you're probably best advised to bite your tongue and realize that you are a member of a small minority. Unless, of course, you really do wish to be viewed as a snob.

Answer: Yes, placing yourself at the beginning is improper grammar. As far as why, I don't know. It just is. To me, it always sounded self-centered to begin a sentence or list of people with myself. I imagine that is the genesis of the rule but I have no idea. It makes someone sound pretty uneducated to do it, though.

Answer: Particular seasons are temporal elements, in exactly the same way as a day of the week or a month of the year. They pinpoint a specific region of time. As such, seasons should be capitalized. However, the actual word 'season' (like any generic time period), should not be capitalized, as a particular time period is not being specified. Examples: In many areas, school now starts in the middle of Summer, technically. -- We're planning a trip for sometime next season. The next tournament isn't until November. -- There is an event planned every month. Your car will be ready on Wednesday. -- Your order should get to you in a few days.

"input: Question: Is there a semantic difference between engine and motor? In some cases, would the use of one or the other word be technically incorrect? 
Answer: I like the definitions provided by WordNet and their definition is the way I've understood the difference: A motor is a machine that converts other forms of energy into mechanical energy and so imparts motion. An engine is a motor that converts thermal energy to mechanical work. wordnetweb.princeton.edu So an engine is a specific type of motor. That's why it's not incorrect to speak of a motorboat, or a motorcar, or a motor speedway, even if the boat or car is clearly powered by combustion. Note that if there's no combustion, there's no engine. Purely electric cars don't have engines. As nouns, motor can also refer to a nonspecific agent that causes motion: ""happiness is the aim of all men and the motor of all action"", and engine can refer to something used to achieve a purpose: ""an engine of change"", a railway locomotive, or a machine used in warfare: ""medieval engines of war"".

"input: Question: I just realized there are some people around my workplace who always try to correct me when using a certain word, saying that that's not how I should speak, and I should use other words (the ones they provide me with) or pretend they didn't understand what I was saying, but it's pretty clear that they did understand. This again with the same purpose, of making me rephrase, or use the words they expect. When doing this, they use, among others, the argument that they sure have understood, but others might not. But then, nobody else complains of not having understood what I was saying. Another argument they use is that even if they understood it, what I said was incorrect. I make the assumption that when I express my ideas in words, I use enough details to get the point across. I would call this type of non-constructive attitude a 'hater' attitude, but I'm curious whether there's a more specific word for this. meta: I'm not a native English speaker, and I don't know a word for this in my language, I'd just use the dictionary to find out if my language has an analogous word. Anyway it would be good to know if there's a word for this concept in these two languages. meta: Also, the situations I refer to happen (mostly) when I'm speaking my own language, but the language really isn't the point here, because I do speak multiple languages and I did meet this behavior (though very rarely) when speaking any language. 
Answer: You could call a person who does that a pedant: Pedant (noun) a person who annoys other people by correcting small errors and giving too much attention to minor details; one who unduly emphasizes minutiae in the presentation or use of knowledge (Merriam-Webster).

"input: Question: Is penultimate commonly used in English, or are its variations (such as second to last) more common? I need to use it in conjunction with the expressions First Payment Date and Last Payment Date to name variables while programming. In my mother language (Portuguese) Penultimate Payment Date would be fine, but it feels strange in English. (I know feels strange is not very helpful, but I'd like to know how to convey the meaning in the most natural way.) 
Answer: Someone I know who is a native speaker of Spanish and a professor at a university in the United States has complained that when he used the word ""penultimate"" in class, the students don't know what he's talking about. The word is perfectly, unimpeachably, 100% correct. It is a bit of an upscale, literary word though. It certainly is a ""term of art"" in fields like linguistics, where it is used commonly to refer to syllables. I searched for the word in the Corpus of Contemporary American English, and divided the results by section: spoken, fiction, magazine, newspaper, and academic, and got these results: spoken: 10 fiction: 53 magazine: 55 newspaper: 36 academic: 93 total: 247 So, it is certainly used in all areas of English, with a moderate skew towards higher registers like academic writing. Depending on the intended audience, a writer contemplating using the word ""penultimate"" should consider that there is a relatively high likelihood that word will not be understood. Instead of ""penultimate"", the phrasing in common usage is either ""next to last"" or ""second to last"". Both of those should be universally understood. Interestingly, Google Ngrams shows that the word ""penultimate"" rose in usage (in published books) steadily from 1800 to about 1990, and since 1990 it has shown a steep dropoff, taking us back to usage levels from the late 1960s. The better-understood terms ""second to last"" and ""next to last"" are less common (again, though, in published booksGoogle Ngrams tells us nothing about spoken usage), with ""next to last"" having more historical usage but a slow tapering off of usage since 1960 and ""second to last"" increasing in usage from 1970 on, with both enjoying approximately the same usage today.

"input: Question: There are many English words with silent letters, words like gnome or island that are spelt with consonants that aren't pronounced, but are there any words that work the other way round, with a pronunciation that includes extra sounds or syllables that are not in the spelling? I can't think of any real examples, hence this question, but a made-up example would be if gnome were spelt nome but pronounced with a g at the start. Or if people started pronouncing offer as ""ofter"" as a sort of weird parallel to after. Note: I don't mean words like rough, where the f sound is spelt gh, because in those cases the spelling does still include letters (however seemingly illogical) for each of the sounds. 
Answer: The name ""Stephen"" is pronounced as ""Steven"", that is, ""ph"" is pronounced ""v"", which is unexpected. Some notes: ""ph"" is normally pronounced ""f"", and both ""v"" and ""f"" are labiodental fricatives, so this strange pronunciation doesn't come entirely out of the blue. The name can also be spelt ""Steven"" (e.g. Steven Tyler), thus matching the pronunciation. Admittedly, this is not exactly what you are asking for (it's like ""colonel"", where ""lo"" is pronounced as an ""r""), but since you consider colonel ""in an adjacent neighbourhood"", you might be interested in ""Stephen"" as well.

"input: Question: I saw an article today that prompted a thought. I only took a year of Latin in high school, so I want to run this by some other people. The article referenced a female senator so-and-so. However, I think that senator, with the -or ending is in the nominative, third declension, which is not gender neutral. So, when referring to a female subject, should senatrix be used instead? Also, does anyone know if there is a reason why the male form is used exclusively? I think females were restricted from the Roman senate perhaps the term just never made sense etymologically because of this? 
Answer: A number of answers have addressed the fact that in the United States, the use of gender-specific nouns is becoming less fashionable. However, that does not explain why a female equivalent of senator has never existed, only why if it did exist once, it might be less favoured now. I try to answer the etymological question here in relation to senatrix. There is no classical support for senatrix. The word senator was, both originally in English and in Latin, an expression referring exclusively to males, simply for the unfortunate dearth of female senators. In classical Rome, a senator (Latin senator) was always a man, and when the word later came to be used to refer to members of foreign legislatures, to my knowledge all such references were to men. Indeed senator itself essentially meant 'elderly man', from senex, 'old, elderly'. The obvious female equivalent, senatrix, does appear in Lewis & Short, but a brief search on Perseus suggests it is not attested in any major classical source. Of course, Rome had two famous female senators in the tenth century mediaeval senate (or what was left of it), and indeed senatrix was the formal title used by Theorda and Marozia, her daughter*. But they are an anomaly, and were I think of little interest when the word senator was imported into English and first popularized. Therefore we begin with a situation in which anyone who read Latin would know that senatrix was not a classical word, and those of us who delight in imposing arcane Latin grammar rules on unsuspecting English speakers are equally reluctant to pollute the lexicon with artificial Latin words [and anything after August 476 AD doesn't count]. On the use of senatrice in French. The French word sometimes used for a female senator (senatrice) appears to be a backformation from senateur + -trice rather than derived directly from *senatrix. That said, senatrice is long established in the French language, appearing in the 1762 edition of the dictionnaire de L'Academie francaise. This is curious, as in 1762 the ancien regime remained strong and the date long precedes the the establishment of the French Senat in 1799. However my knowledge of French and France is embarrassingly poor, so all I shall say is that 1762 is long after the word senator appeared in English. Therefore senator had become an English word by this time, and I suggest that the continuing evolution of its cognate in French would have had limited effect on the use of senator in English. The Academie francaise now discourages the use of senatrice. There is little use of senatrix at any time in English. A Google Ngram search reveals that senatrix did have a brief period of use in the early twentieth century, around the time that the notion of female senators entered the public discourse. However, a more detailed inspection reveals that this seems to be an upswing in interest about Theodora and Marozia, rather than in the composition of the modern legislature. In that search I did find one tantalizing reference to the 'senatrix from Kansas', but as the reference dates from 1898, eighty years before the first female senator from Kansas, and is entitled 'Judge's Library: A Monthly Magazine of Fun', it cannot be taken at face value. senatrix has little in the way of a history and less in the way of a future. Lacking a sound etymological past, senatrix was not popular among those most likely to have adopted it; and until 1932 there was regrettably very little need for the word to be used at all in popular discourse. As the other answers carefully elucidate, in English, particularly American English, there is a trend away from long-established gender-specific words, so it seems quite unlikely we will see the adoption of any artificial ones any time soon. *You may recall that Gibbon famously describes them in Decline and Fall as 'sister prostitutes', but later sources are quite clear that they were mother and daughter. Gibbon does not use the word senatrix as far as I can see.

"input: Question: Is there a word or phrase which describes ""choice of misleading words"", or the negation: ""choice of non-misleading words""? The nearest phrases I can think of are linguistic deception, or controlled language, as in Nineteen Eighty-Four. For example, Richard Stallman actively opposes such misuse of language: I think it is ok for authors (please let's not call them creators, they are not gods) to ask for money for copies of their works (please let's not devalue these works by calling them content) in order to gain income (the term compensation falsely implies it is a matter of making up for some kind of damages). Another example is ""credit"" in banking, which just makes ""debt"" sound like a good thing. EDIT: The term may either refer to an individual's malicious use of misleading terminology, or to widely-accepted use of misleading terminology. The answers reflect this, but my question does not. 
Answer: I'm not sure if you're looking for a verb meaning ""to use misleading words"" or if you're looking for a noun referring to the misleading words themselves or the act of using misleading words. Either way, consider an adjective: Disingenuous disingenuous (adj). Lacking in candor. Also : giving a false appearance of simple frankness: CALCULATING. (From Merriam-Webster online) While I'm not finding this (explicitly) in any dictionary definitions, I'm also used to ""disingenuous"" carrying a connotation of being manipulative or sneaky.

"input: Question: I live in Australia, but am expected to use US English in my work. I am therefore used to spelling ""-ise"" as ""-ize"". I was a little surprised to find that ""enterprise"" is almost universally spelt with ""-ise"". Is there any particular reason that this is the case for this example, when ""-ize"" is so widely preferred in US English? 
Answer: For one, because the etymology is different. -ise (-ize) is a causative suffix in formalise, realise etc. (to make something formal, to make something real...) But enterprise is not ""to make something enterpre"" or similar (whatever that might mean). The prise bit comes as a past participle of French prendre (to grasp, to take). Another answer is that enterprize is actually attested, and was apparently used more than enterprise in the second half of 18th century (N-gram viewer).

Of course, I'm a native English speaker, and I have no idea either, hence this question. The full question, for context, was ""Several of our sister sites have taken to featuring Questions [...]"". It does seem odd, considering that English (usually) uses masculine terms as the default.

"input: Question: I'm currently writing an article that includes two contexts of communication: effectiveness and competence. Incompetent people can misuse terminology all day and the ideas are effective and do technically work. However I'm looking for a word or term that has two or more meanings and the misuse of could lead to bodily harm or even death; this is to promote the idea of the aspect of competently communicating one's ideas. What word if not used competently could end up leading to injury or death in a context that most people could understand with little-to-no explanation? 
Answer: This may not be exactly what you are looking for, but might work in the context. inflammable Many people see the ""in"" as a negative prefix, and believe anything marked inflammable is flame retardant. However, both flammable and inflammable have the same meaning: ...both mean ""capable of being easily ignited and of burning quickly."" This makes no sense to the Modern English speaker. In English, we think of in- as a prefix that means ""not"": inactive means ""not active,"" inconclusive means ""not conclusive,"" inconsiderate means ""not considerate."" Therefore, inflammable should mean ""not flammable."" -Merriam Webster Because of this, volatile or combustible materials are often labeled as ""flammable"" to avoid a potentially hazardous misinterpretation.

But recently I heard that in such cases I should ask ""Does that make sense?"" instead. Is this true? Which option is appropriate to use in business communication? 
Answer: I generally go with a simple: Is this explanation okay..? As it sounds neutral and encourages the receiver to provide feedback.

"input: Question: There is a saying in Hindi in India ""teri lal"" which translates ""yours is red"" which means ""Whatever the case may be you are right"" as in ""you are always right"". It is a sarcastic way of telling (usually) a know-it-all person (but not meant truly) ""you are right"". Is there an equivalent version of this phrase in English? Example Rohan (the know-it-all): The moon is a sphere John: hmmm Rohan: The moon has its own light. John: OK ""teri lal"" (you are right sarcastically) 
Answer: Though I agree with the others that the sarcasm is usually implied in the tone of the speaker, there is an idiomatic expression which implies a non-committal agreement without sounding overly offensive: whatever you say TFD(idioms): whatever you say I accept what you say, and I'm not going to argue with you. Usually implies that one doesn't really agree with the other person, but is going to do it to avoid a conflict. A: ""Don't worry about the auditors, just run the numbers like I told you.""
