"input: Question: Is there any difference between the two? In a technical document I have used a phrase ""this is a temporal solution"" and my coworker told that he'd use ""temporary"" in the context. Is one of the two more correct than the second? 
Answer: Temporal refers more to a time relationship between two variables. ""he started abusing alcohol after he lost his job"" shows a ""temporal"", not ""temporary"" relationship between alcohol use and job loss. It kinds of establishes an association. I don't think its exactly synonymous to temporary.

"input: Question: I am creating a computer game in which the character needs to consume food in order to not starve to death. In the game I can display the level of how much food the character currently needs via ""hunger level"" - the higher this value, the more desperately the character needs food. But what I want now is to turn that around, so that this level tells how full the stomach of the character is. In German we have a word for that, ""Sattigung"", which means how full my stomach is (or better: how full it feels to me), it is basically the opposite of hunger. Is there a similar word in English, which means exactly that, the opposite of hunger? It might be something like ""saturation"", but from what I can tell this word is usually used in a technical context, like in ""the saturation of a color"". Can I use that ""saturation"" to describe the opposite of hunger of a human or animal, or is there a better word for that? 
Answer: I think the apter word is 'satiety' than 'saturation' in the OP's context. satiety thestateof beingcompletely satisfied,especiallywithfoodor pleasure, so that you could not have any more.

"input: Question: How can I explain to people that the phrase off of is grammatically incorrect? I've heard this phrase used a lot, especially by Americans (though they aren't the only ones). In my understanding, off of should usually be replaced by off, as in, I took the book off the shelf as opposed to I took the book off of the shelf Am I wrong? Or is there perhaps some simple way I can explain this to most people? 
Answer: In my opinion, if you mean to say, ""off of"", then you should instead say, ""from"". For example, ""Take the book off of the bookcase"", when, ""Take the book from the bookcase"", is preferable. As I understand it, the expression ""off of"", is an Americanism, but the pseudo-antonym, ""on of"", is rarely (if not never), found in any language as far as I am aware.

"input: Question: There is a joke: Q: What is grey and comes in quarts? A: An elephant. Why? Why does it come in quarts? What is funny here? 
Answer: I feel like I'm walking into some kind of trolling here, but I believe the joke is based around the definition of ""comes"" which is synomymous with ""ejaculates"". In other words, the joke is implying that volume of the elephant's ejaculate is rather large: a ""quart"" of course being another word for a quarter of a gallon, aka two pints. The first-glance reading of ""comes in quarts"" would be ""is available in quarts"" (like milk), and the reversal of the understood meaning of ""comes"" is where the humour arises (if it does arise).

"input: Question: Sometimes I go through articles and find the expression utilize, I've always been wondering if there are special cases in which it should be used instead of used. Also because google ngram clearly shows that used is used (sorry for that ;D) much more. Thanks for your help and happy new year! 
Answer: Some dictionaries gloss utilize as using something for a purpose that it is not normally employed for. But prescriptive grammarians are pretty clear on such use. Fowler in Modern English Usage (p670) says: If differentiation were possible between utilize and use it would be that utilize has the special meaning of make good use of, especially of something that was not intended for the purpose but will serve. But this distinction has disappeared beyond recall; utilize is now ordinarily treated as a LONG VARIANT of use. A form is enclosed herewith for favour of your utilization is an example of the pretentious diction that prefers the long word. Partidge in Usage and Abusage (p343) is typically blunt: utilize is, 99 times out of 100, much inferior to use; the other one time it is merely inferior. And here is the more contemporary Grammar Girl's similar take on the issue. Nevertheless, this Usage Note from TheFreeDictionary indicates when utilize might indeed be the better choice: A number of critics have remarked that utilize is an unnecessary substitute for use. It is true that many occurrences of utilize could be replaced by use with no loss to anything but pretentiousness, for example, in sentences such as They utilized questionable methods in their analysis or We hope that many commuters will continue to utilize mass transit after the bridge has reopened. But utilize can mean ""to find a profitable or practical use for."" Thus the sentence The teachers were unable to use the new computers might mean only that the teachers were unable to operate the computers, whereas The teachers were unable to utilize the new computers suggests that the teachers could not find ways to employ the computers in instruction.

"input: Question: I'm trying to describe a situation in which a person prepares for an event, then realises the event won't happen, and so they undo their preparations, returning to a state of unpreparedness. Whenever I search for the opposite of ""prepare"", I get words that describe a failure to prepare in the first place, or at best words that describe what happens to the preparations, not words that describe what happens to the person. Is there a word that captures what happens to the person as they return to a state of unpreparedness?

"input: Question: What's the difference in meaning between ""register"" and ""registry""? Can both be used interchangeably when talking about an official (public) list of items, records? 
Answer: Registry is a place of registration or a book or list in which registration is made. Registration is the act of registration, so a registration number is a number under which something such as a company or a person is registered. A registry number, however, is the number given to a place of registration or a book or list of registration, since too many of them may be around, but that number is not large, say, in five digits mostly because there are only a limited number of registration places or books or lists that are in existence for every particular purpose while a registration number involving companies, items, goods or persons may be as large as 16 digits and more and may comprise from letters and digits both, because there a great many numbers of those items or companies or persons who are registered.

How could this be tested?.

"input: Question: We have racism, which implies hate against one or more races. We have sexism, which implies hate against one of the sexes. We have nationalism, which implies hate against one or more nationalities. Is there such a single word for hate against one or more religions? I realize that this might be difficult to answer because some religions closely identify with certain races and/or nationalities. If it makes it easier, the question can be narrowed down to Christianity, specifically, or broadened to describe a general hatred for all religion. 
Answer: No -ism implies hate. It implies the belief in a value derived from the things the -ism relates to. Nationalism implies the belief that different nations are of different value. Sexism implies that different sexes have different value. It does not imply hate. A -phobia, however, implies fear, literally, but often is used in a wider sense meaning avoidance, distance, and (sometimes) hate. So what you are looking for is a religiophobia. But with just around 5k hits on Google, this word still seems to be kind of uncommon and made-up.

"input: Question: I once read that JRR Tolkien, a linguist by profession and of The Lord of the Rings fame, wrote his masterpiece using elements of archaic English to emulate the Bible. Following a question on writers.SE, and comments below, this statement is not as clear as I took it. As non-native speaker, I stumbled upon a few words the first time that I read the book (in original version). It is clear that he did use a few words that, IMHO, were deemed archaic already by the time the novel was published in 1954. Most notably amongst them are the use of thou and thee. He also used less common or less modern words (or meanings), as can be seen in this list. It is even the subject of a book. As an illustration ""Begone, foul dwimmerlaik, lord of carrion! Leave the dead in peace!"" A cold voice answered: 'Come not between the Nazgul and his prey! Or he will not slay thee in thy turn. He will bear thee away to the houses of lamentation, beyond all darkness, where thy flesh shall be devoured, and thy shrivelled mind be left naked to the Lidless Eye."" A sword rang as it was drawn. ""Do what you will; but I will hinder it, if I may."" ""Hinder me? Thou fool. No living man may hinder me!"" Then Merry heard of all sounds in that hour the strangest. It seemed that Dernhelm laughed, and the clear voice was like the ring of steel. ""But no living man am I!"" -- J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings (source) Tolkien is known to have written a story to give life to made-up languages. And I have the feeling he used (somewhat) old(er) English for the speech of the Elves with Men, equally for educational purpose. I understand that one needs to define some terms, in particular ""archaic"". I would say that archaic words and/or expressions are words and/or expressions that would be out of place (due to it being too old) in a conversation of the time, and which would be noticed by the participants of the conversation as such. Or hasn't been used commonly for 50-100 years. Now, from the elements above, did Tolkien use archaic elements of language when writing the Lord of the Ring? Or do these words strike me as old because I am non-native and/or they are not so much in use today, but were faily common back then (when he wrote it) at least in University circles where he was. PS. I did hesitate to ask this question in Writers.SE, SciFi.SE, ELL.SE or here. But ultimately as it is about English language as such I thought it was better here. But please to tell me if I should ask it somewhere more appropriate? PPS. I hope I managed to limit the ""opinion-based"" part of the question. 
Answer: The basic answer to your question of whether he used archaic language to emulate the Bible is no, of course not. There is one specific exception, however, which I explain further on. The Lord of the Rings is composed entirely in Modern English using all manner of style and register. This is deliberate. (I will exempt Eomer's ""Westu Theoden hal!"" taken directly from Beowulf's ""Ws u, Hrogar, hal"", as that actually is Old English. Nothing else is.) Tolkien himself specifically explains exactly why he resorts to the second-person singular in certain situations. Please read Appendix F, section II, ""On Translation"" for this and a great deal more about what he was doing, and why, when he attributed different styles of speech to different characters at different times. The Witch-king's use of the second person was intended to be belittling. In Tolkien's letter to Milton Waldman, while attempting to present a summary of the book's plot and character, Tolkien states that: . . . even in style it is to include the colloquialism and vulgarity of the Hobbits, poetry and the highest style of prose. So his mixing of low and high, and even of poetry and prose, was done with full awareness and intent. Indeed, in the same Waldman letter he also wrote: Hardly a word in its 600,000 or more has been unconsidered. And the placing, size, style, and contribution to the whole of all the features, incidents, and chapters has been laboriously pondered Perhaps the best explanation for why Tolkien ever used archaic phrasing can be found in his Letter #171, wherein he takes up the accusation of gratuitous ""tushery"" (archaism). He addresses the point of why one would use archaic language to represent what was (purported to be) spoken by an archaic people in this way. Dear Hugh, ....Don't be disturbed! I have not noticed any impertinence (or sycophancy) in your letters; and anyone so appreciative and so perceptive is entitled to criticism. Anyway I do not naturally breathe an air of undiluted incense! It was not what you said (last letter but one, not the one that I answered) or your right to say it, that might have called for a reply, if I had the time for it; but the pain that I always feel when anyone in an age in which almost all auctorial manhandling of English is permitted (especially if disruptive) in the name of art or 'personal expression' immediately dismisses out of court deliberate 'archaism'. The proper use of 'tushery' is to apply it to the kind of bogus 'medieval' stuff which attempts (without knowledge) to give a supposed temporal colour with expletives, such as tush, pish, zounds, marry, and the like. But a real archaic English is far more terse than modern; also many of things said could not be said in our slack and often frivolous idiom. Of course, not being specially well read in modern English, and far more familiar with works in the ancient and 'middle' idioms, my own ear is to some extent affected; so that though I could easily recollect how a modern would put this or that, what comes easiest to mind or pen is not quite that. But take an example from the chapter that you specially singled out (and called terrible): Book iii, 'The King of the Golden Hall'. 'Nay, Gandalf!' said the King. 'You do not know your own skill in healing. It shall not be so. I myself will go to war, to fall in the front of battle, if it must be. Thus shall I sleep better.' This is a fair example moderated or watered archaism. Using only words that still are used or known to the educated, the King would really have said 'Nay, thou (n')wost not thine own skill in healing. It shall not be so. I myself will go to war, to fall...' etc. I know well enough what a modern would say. 'Not at all, my dear G. You don't know your own skill as a doctor. Things aren't going to be like that. I shall go to the war in person, even if I have to be one of the first casualties' and then what? Theoden would certainly think, and probably say 'thus shall I sleep better'! But people who think like that just do not talk a modern idiom. You can have 'I shall lie easier in my grave', or 'I should sleep sounder in my grave like that rather than if I stayed at home' if you like. But there would be an insincerity of thought, a disunion of word and meaning. For a King who spoke in a modern style would not really think in such terms at all, and any reference to sleeping quietly in the grave would be a deliberate archaism of expression on his part (however worded) far more bogus than the actual 'archaic' English that I have used. Like some non-Christian making a reference to some Christian belief which did not in fact move him at all. Or p.127, as an example of 'archaism' that cannot be defended as 'dramatic', since it is not in dialogue, but the author's description of the arming of the guests which seemed specially to upset you. But such 'heroic' scenes do not occur in a modern setting to which a modern idiom belongs. Why deliberately ignore, refuse to use the wealth of English which leaves us a choice of styles without any possibility of unintelligibility. I can see no more reason for not using the much terser and more vivid ancient style than for changing the obsolete weapons, helms, shields and hauberks into modern uniforms. 'Helms too they chose' is archaic. Some (wrongly) class it as 'inversion', since normal order is 'They also chose helmets' or 'they chose helmets too'. (Real mod. E. 'They also picked out some helmets and round shields.) But this is not normal order, and if mod. E. has lost the trick of putting a word desired to emphasize (for pictorial, emotional or logical reasons) into prominent first place, without addition of a lot of little 'empty' words (as the Chinese say), so much the worse for it. And so much the better for it the sooner it learns the trick again. And some one must begin the teaching, by example. I am sorry to find you so affected by the extraordinary 20th C. delusion that its usages per se and simply as 'contemporary' irrespective of whether they are terser, more vivid (or even nobler!) have some peculiar validity, above those of other times, so that not to use them (even when quite unsuitable in tone) is a solecism, a gaffe, a thing at which one's friends shudder or feel hot under the collar. Shake yourself out of this parochialism of time! Also (not to be too donnish) learn to discriminate between the bogus and genuine antique as you would if you hoped not to be cheated by a dealer! He does not actually write archaic language, or not fully archaic, for he would have lost the reader. What he does do at times is watered or moderated archaism, and he does this for a distinct reason given above. Every linguistic effect he used has a specific purpose that makes good sense in that context. Tolkien was a master of this, and if you think it all archaic, you haven't been reading closely enough. Look at the rustic speech of the hobbits or the coarse speech of the orcs and trolls: all styles and registers are represented in the book, from the low to the very highest. I would say that most uses of archaic language in fantasy literature written today are fake. That's because there is so much of it, and Sturgeon's Law applies. They are the very embodiment of what Tolkien complained of in his letter to Hugh Brogan. He himself doesn't do that because he actually knew what he was writing. Most people do not, and so their would-be antique language comes off sounding bogus, not authentic. About that exception. The one, and I believe only, place where Tolkien deliberately echoed the KJV is in the chapter ""The Stewart and the King"" from Book VI. The eagle's song found there is quite obviously cast in the stylized language of the Psalms. I believe Tolkien felt that nothing short of Biblical language could suitably convey the ""sudden joy as poignant as grief"" of the unexpected eucatastrophe after all but the wannest of hopes had been forgotten. You really should read Tom Shippey's The Road to Middle-Earth: How J. R. R. Tolkien Created a New Mythology, preferably the 2003 edition. Shippey discusses Tolkien's use of language at length. He also shows that all modes of Frye's Anatomy of Criticism are present based on the characters involved, all the way from the mythic to the ironic.

"input: Question: When should whilst be used instead of while? For example, should I use the first or the second sentence? They don't do this whilst they do that. They don't do this while they do that. Which would be correct? 
Answer: The two words 'while' and 'whilst' mean the same thing. They could be considered alternate pronunciations of the same word, similar to among/amongst or further/farther. 'While' came first, and then 'whilst' was derived from it. But they are not used with the same frequency and they give different 'feels'. 'While' is much more common (from Google nGrams) 'Whilst' sounds archaic, affected, or hyperacademic (which means no one in academia uses it). To Americans, 'whilst' sounds British, but at least in print, there is very little difference in the frequencies of the two words between AmE and BrE (via Google nGrams) In the end, it is correct grammar to use them interchangeably, but it is bad style...uh sorry, not the current fashion to use 'whilst'. No one (at least not in formal writing, like for newspapers or academic writing) uses 'whilst' anymore. It may be common and accepted in certain varieties of English (say Indian English) but is very jarring in standard English. However, in the 18th century the two were on more equal terms. The classic study of text analysis by Mosteller and Wallace to help discover the authorship of the Federalist papers was based primarily on the use of differentiating pairs like this.

Answer: I looked into this myself recently and couldn't find a definitive answer. The best I came up with was that numeric values in a formal document or contract are often crucial to its purpose. Restating a number in parentheses after spelling it out is a way to ensure the reader that the number is correct.

"input: Question: Possible Duplicate: What day is next Tuesday? Imagine that it's Monday, the 1st. The weekend would be the 6th & 7th. How do you refer properly to the coming weekend, ""This weekend"" or ""Next weekend""? I believe that using ""next weekend"" would refer to the 13th & 14th and ""this weekend"" would refer to this week's end. Technically the coming weekend (6th & 7th) would be the next weekend on the calendar. So which is correct? I'm hoping for a definitive answer with backing since this is an argument over opinion. 
Answer: The issue isn't as definitive as you might think. Ultimately, it comes down to what interpretation of ""next"" you consider to be correct. For example, the American Heritage Dictionary (4th ed) defines 'next' simply as Immediately following, as in time, order, or sequence Following this definition, ""next weekend"" will always mean the weekend with the start date in closes proximity in time. If the phrase is used during a weekend, of course, you'd be referring to the weekend following the one you are currently experiencing. However, the issue gets more complicated if you look to other definitions. The Oxford American Dictionary has a specific definition for 'next' when used in the context of time: (of a day of the week) nearest (or the nearest but one) after the present : not this Wednesday, next Wednesday Here, we're given the choice: it can either mean the weekend with the closest start date, or the following one (as specified by the parenthetical addition or the nearest but one). This definition has come about mostly because of usage development. Many words and phrases in the english dictionary have meanings contrary to their technical definitions, and yet are still used commonly and considered valid. Thus, while technically ""next"" implies immediate sequence, it is used in other ways (which dictionaries like the OAD have accommodated for validity), so it's really a matter of personal preference. For example, it is unlikely that I will even use the phrase ""next weekend"" during the week, because some people might be confused as to what I am referring to. Instead, I will say ""this weekend,"" unless it is currently the weekend, in which case I will say ""next weekend."".

"input: Question: Is there a word that describes or denotes a type of conversation in which two speakers speak two different languages. In our country, Pakistan, there are approximately 75 languages, from which Urdu, Punjabi and Sindhi are common, excluding English. So today I found two women speaking two different languages. For example: Speaker 1 has Urdu as their mother tongue. Speaker 2 has Sindhi as their mother tongue. Speaker 1 and 2 spoke their own mother tongue, which are different (Urdu and Sindhi) but both can understand each other's language. I thought that this is known as ""intermingling conversation,"" or a ""code switching.""

In that question, the phrase ""bilingual dialogue"" was suggested, which I (and others may) think that this refers to the code switching as well, which I don't want here. Some words confuse the readers which sense do they mean. I would also love to quote the comment of @Lambie regarding the term ""bilingual"" over here: ""Bilingual refers to one person. Not two people each of whom has a passive knowledge of the other's language but do not speak it well enough to use it actively."" 
Answer: I am a translator and interpreter and speak four languages (I am quadri-lingual, in fact). There is no specific term for this. And it's certainly not bilingual. If this refers to two people, it just means they at least passively know each other languages but actively only use their own. They each have a passive knowledge of the other's language, otherwise they'd be speaking one or the other. They are passive ""speakers"" of a language. passive speaker Passive knowledge means you can understand a language or read a language but cannot actively speak it with any confidence. For example, in my case, I speak three Romance languages but do not actively speak Italian. However, my passive knowledge of Italian is very good so I can actually carry on a conversation with an Italian speaker if they can understand English. (In fact, I can carry on a simple conversation but can understand an advanced one passively.) But beware: In the world of translation and interpretation, a passive language has a more technical meaning: it means the language from which a translator or interpreter is working. This is often symbolized as: German>English, English>Chinese. If a person is bilingual (which is not as frequent as one might imagine), this is signified like this: English<>Chinese. Here is a blog post about this issue as regards active and passive vocabulary in language learning, though it applies to monolinguals as well. passive and active vocabulary I often speak English to my husband and he responds in Spanish. We have a conversation in two languages. Bilingual means an individual can speak two languages equally well, though there are different levels of bilingualism. And, if I hear someone say: ""We had a bilingual conversation."" I would understand that each of the speakers spoke two languages and both switched back and forth between those two languages without causing a break in their conversation due to lack of understanding. As for codes, mixing and switching them is not ""inter-lingual"". A speaker code switches within her or his own language. Reading over the answers, I had to laugh when thinking about having a conversation with someone where one person uses a different language than the other and they understand each other. Of course, they understand each other, otherwise it would not be a conversation, would it? And, I daresay that mutual intelligibility is an issue that does not involve more than one language necessarily. Who hasn't had a conversation with eggheads in a monolingual situation where there was no ""mutual intelligibility"" at all? And for the record, the idea that a Spanish speaker can understand a Portuguese speaker is a very specious idea. The fact much in the two languages is very similar does not account for the parts that are completely different. And this can lead to major misunderstandings and comical situations. (I just can't think of an example at the moment, as I write.) The mutual intelligibility factor is true only to a limited extent.

"input: Question: There are many English words with silent letters, words like gnome or island that are spelt with consonants that aren't pronounced, but are there any words that work the other way round, with a pronunciation that includes extra sounds or syllables that are not in the spelling? I can't think of any real examples, hence this question, but a made-up example would be if gnome were spelt nome but pronounced with a g at the start. Or if people started pronouncing offer as ""ofter"" as a sort of weird parallel to after. Note: I don't mean words like rough, where the f sound is spelt gh, because in those cases the spelling does still include letters (however seemingly illogical) for each of the sounds.

"input: Question: I need to find a shortened format (abbreviation) for the words ""look at"" (to be used when referring people to another website). For example: Example given e.g 
Answer: The latinate abbreviation (corresponding to ""e.g."" for exempli gratia) is ""q.v."" for quod vide = ""which see"", to direct someone elsewhere for further information. If it's an abbreviation you want, that's the perfect fit. As other answers point out, however, ""see"" is even shorter, and provides more clarity. While ""q.v."" is common enough in some academic writing, it's not exactly common parlance. My own sense is that ""cf."" should not be used here (even though it is in the ""accepted"" answer): it has a real meaning, and that meaning is ""compare"". From the question, that isn't the intended meaning. It is properly used in situations to contrast one thing with another (see also the advice from the the APA blog on the use of ""cf."").

Here we are saying that the amount of punishment is smaller. But if you say ""substitute the lesser punishment"" you are saying the type of punishment is not as severe. Forty lashes is less punishment than 100 lashes. Being pelted with rotten tomatoes is a lesser punishment than being pelted with rocks.

Maybe a sprinkling of aspersions will make them appear more tiny vs. this casting aspersions upon her. Perhaps a sprinkling of aspersions sounds less inoffensive; somewhat harmless, or innocuous--somehow. Seem like a piddling of aspersions. Maybe because there's less of them. I don't know. Sometimes, if I apply a sprinkling of aspersions on my wife instead of casting, she thinks them funny. Try a sprinkling of aspersions instead. If that doesn't work, you can always go back to casting aspersions upon her, or even try dusting or powdering her with aspersions. See if that works. Good luck!.

"input: Question: When one buys a house with a fully done basement, is it known as a furnished basement or a finished basement? I've heard both used, but I was always under the impression that the right usage is a furnished basement. I thought, being that the words sound similar, the two terms became confused and eventually interchangeable, but perhaps both are correct. Regardless, any logical, coherent answer to this question would be appreciated! 
Answer: Given that a basement is the lowest habitable part of a building (wholly or partly underground, were it not finished, it wouldn't be habitable, I'd have thought. But an ordinary room in a house above ground level may well be finished, but waiting for furniture, which, when it is installed, makes the room furnished. Without furniture, a room, anywhere, is said to be unfurnished. Therefore, a basement, or any room, can be finished, but unfurnished. If it was furnished, it pretty well has to be assumed that it was a finished room before putting furniture in it. It is quite possible that an estate agent may massage things, and advertise a finished basement as a furnished basement, or vice versa, to encourage 'good' marketing...

"input: Question: Is there a semantic difference between engine and motor? In some cases, would the use of one or the other word be technically incorrect? 
Answer: The real difference, is the fact that ""motors"" run on electricity, while ""engines"" run on combustion. However, many people interchange the usage of these words: On the rare occasions we encounter one, we refer to a steam locomotive as an engine, the same word that we give to the motive power of an aircraft. But all electrical devices are driven by motors. In Britain at least, one's personal transport is a motor car (with compounds such as motor trade, motor vehicle and motor sport), even though it's always powered by an engine. Small boats may have outboard motors and then are often called motor boats. From a mechanic: So, what is the difference between an engine and a motor? Motors are electric. Electricity powers motors. Engines are powered by come sort of pressure or combustion, ie: steam engines, automobile engines, diesel engines. Pretty simple, really.

"input: Question: English isn't my mother tongue, and when we recently talked to a native speaker (during some company audit), he pointed out that the plural word ""trainings"" is actually wrong (he pointed that it is a very common mistake and was almost amused by it). I couldn't understand why and wondered what the correct plural of ""training"" would be. Online Dictionaries/Thesaurus don't answer it, so it's probably another opinion-based statement. I haven't found a source to back it up, though. 
Answer: Training is both countable and uncountable. Usually, referring to a process, it is uncountable and has no plural. It is sometimes used to mean ""a specific training event"", and is then countable, and has the plural ""trainings"". The OED has examples of this use going back to 1578, with the plural recorded from 1598.

"input: Question: Upon answering the telephone, the person calling asks if Joan is available. If Joan is the person who answered the phone, should she say ""This is her"" or ""This is she""? 
Answer: It's correct either way. English has lost its case system almost completely. This makes it hard even for native speakers to decide between subject case (nominative) and object case (formerly accusative/dative). A long time ago far too long ago to be directly relevant today , English still had a 'proper' case system and the copula be was followed by subject case. This is normal for Indo-European languages. Therefore, originally it would have been something like (translating to modern) ""It is she"". However, just like French but under the radar, English developed emphatic forms of its pronouns. When an adult asks a bunch of children ""Qui veut de la glace ?"" / ""Who wants some ice cream?"", the children's natural response is ""Moi ! Moi ! Moi !"" / ""Me! Me! Me!"", not ""Je ! Je ! Je !"" / ""I! I! I!"" This doesn't mean that the response is in dative / object case but that the response is emphatic. The same emphatic form of the personal pronoun is also used in connection with the copula etre / be: ""C'est moi."" / ""This is me."" The French third person feminine pronoun happens to have no special emphatic form. It's elle whether emphatic or not. In English, the non-emphatic subject case is she, and all other forms (object case and emphatic form) are her. Therefore, in natural English the correct answer is ""This is her."" This is how non-native speakers learn to say the sentence. For some reason, there is a tradition in English grammar (as taught to native speakers) to completely ignore the issue of emphatic pronouns and to assume that English has to work like German, which does not have them, or like Latin, where only emphatic pronouns exist and these carry the case distinctions. A non-native speaker who missed the drills for the emphatic pronouns but who, coming from another Indo-European language, knows about subject case after be, will quite logically say ""This is she."" English prescriptivism, in its trademark cluelessness (often pointed out by proper linguists), stepped into the same trap. English has a tradition of rules being made up by ignorant prescriptivists and then taught to generations of students and used as shibboleths that serve to distinguish those who received a 'proper' education from those who just use the language naturally and correctly, such as intelligent members of the working class and of course the likes of Charles Dickens and Jane Austen. As a result, ""This is she"" became a correct alternative again, long after it had fallen out of use. (Note on case terminology: English still has subject case and object case, though it only marks them on pronouns. It also has genitive pronouns, but since the former genitive suffix 's is now a possession-marking clitic, the status of genitive as a case in English is even less clear. English subject case is exactly the same thing that is called nominative in German, Latin etc. English object case is the result of a merger of accusative and dative, also known as accudative. This merger has long been completed in English, has almost completed in Dutch and many German dialects, but is still in progress in standard German.).

"input: Question: When it comes to cities and boats named after saints, it seems that ""Santa"" is always female and ""San"" is always male. e.g. Male Saints: San Diego, San Francisco, San Antonio Female Saints: Santa Barbara, Santa Maria So why isn't ""Santa Claus"" a woman like all the other ""Santa""s? 
Answer: The city names you quote are all derived from Spanish, where ""San"" (or ""Santo"", as @tchrist clarifies below) is the male inflection and ""Santa"" the female one. However, Santa Claus isn't derived from Spanish, but from Dutch, where it was originally rendered as Sante Klaas, and was modified to Santa when it was adopted into English (and from English, to the rest of the world). Here's Etymonline's take on it: from dialectal Dutch Sante Klaas, from Middle Dutch Sinter Niklaas ""Saint Nicholas,"" English, like all other languages, borrows words from many sources, and they often carry over remnants of their original grammar or usage, even when it makes for inconsistent usage in English.

"input: Question: I need a single-word to describe something good that (unexpectedly) resulted from something bad. This good thing could not have occurred without the bad event happening first, as a precursor. Example sentence: ""I got in a horrible car accident and broke my leg, but falling in love with my nurse at the hospital was the ____,"" (something like that). 
Answer: The word irony has undergone a bit of a semantic shift and is often used for a perceived contradiction, among others a contradiction between one's expectations and an actual fact or event. Merriam-Webster gives as one of its meanings incongruity between the actual result of a sequence of events and the normal or expected result and continues with examples in which the outcome is worse than expected; but it can be used for better outcomes as well, like in your case: ""Falling in love with the nurse was the irony of my accident.""

"input: Question: Possible Duplicate: How should I punctuate around quotes? When should end punctuation go inside quotes? Or is it region specific? I was always taught that when ending a quotation, that punctuation remains inside of the quote. I think he said, ""we should go to the store."" Are you sure he said, ""we should go to the store?"" As opposed to: I think he said, ""we should go to the store"". Are you sure he said, ""we should go to the store""? This is just an arbitrary example off of the top of my head, and it's hard for me to come up with an example for the second usage because it looks completely wrong to me. I actually got into a small argument with my girlfriend earlier this year because she uses something similar to the second example, and said that's how she was taught (which is why I ask if it's region-specific.) Anyway, is there a correct usage for ending a quotation with punctuation? 
Answer: In American English, commas and periods go inside the quotation marks. Semi-colons, question marks and exclamation marks go inside the quotation marks only if they're part of the quotation. E.g., ""What time is it?"" he asked. Did he really say, ""I don't care""? So your example should be the following: I think he said, ""we should go to the store.""

Answer: According to the Oxford English Dictionary, as quoted by the site below, you hyphenate if the compound adjective is before the noun and don't hyphenate if it is after the noun. With compound adjectives formed from the adverb well and a participle (e.g., well-known), or from a phrase (e.g., up-to-date), you should use a hyphen (or hyphens) when the compound comes before the noun: well-known brands of coffee; an up-to-date account, but not when the compound comes after the noun: His music was also well known in England. Their figures are up to date. From Oxford Dictionaries via Adverbs and Hyphens by Maeve Maddox for Daily Writing Tips. In this case the noun is myself and before the adjective, so no hyphen. In other styles, this may not necessarily hold true. For instance, in APA style, hyphens are discouraged unless they add clarity.

"input: Question: Should I write it like this? Or perhaps like this? Should I write it like this? or perhaps like this? What about after an exclamation mark or semicolon? 
Answer: Did the sentence end after the question mark? Yes. Then you need a capital letter to start the new sentence, just as usual. No. Then the question mark shouldn't have been there, since it ends a sentence. Right, I should expand on that rather than just be a grumpy old man. The capitalization rule that we care about here is that the first word of a sentence starts with a capital letter, so the question is really about what ends a sentence. The answer to that is easy: terminal punctuation, i.e. a full stop (or period if you're American), question mark or exclamation mark. There's a visual clue in that '?' and '!' are decorated full stops; you just have to remember that a colon (':') isn't really a decorated full stop, not that you'd ever know by looking at it. Colons, semicolons and commas aren't terminal punctuation, so they don't end a sentence and so don't force the next letter to be a capital. It may be a capital letter for some other reason such as being the start of a proper name, but not because it is starting a sentence. There are exceptions to this rule, occasions when '?' and '!' become non-terminal punctuation. The most obvious is in quoted speech: if the speaker asks a question or makes an exclamation, the '?' or '!' doesn't have to be terminal if the sentence carries on after the quote. ""Should I write it like this?"" he asked. ""Or perhaps like this?"" The other class of exception is for what are probably really parenthetical comments. If you have a short phrase that you could have put aside in parentheses or dashes, then a question mark or exclamation mark can be used at the end of that phrase without ending the sentence. Be sparing with this. It looks wrong at a first read, and engenders the sort of argument I had with Jason in the comments below! Should I write it like this, or abracadabra! like this? Going back to the examples, and adding a few more for fun: Should I write it like this? Or perhaps like this? Should I write it like this? or perhaps like this? Should I write it like this, or perhaps like that? ""Should I write it like this?"" he asked, ""or perhaps like that?"" Example 2 with the lowercase ""or"" is just plain wrong. Crusty old grammarians who disapprove of starting sentences with conjunctions may frown at example 1 all they like, but it's a perfectly acceptable fragmentary sentence. Whether it's the right answer or not is another question entirely. Example 1 makes the point that the questions are distinct, though they are strongly linked otherwise the whole structure wouldn't work. Example 3 on the other hand emphasizes that the two questions are options in a common situation, as well as reflecting a different way of saying them. That is obvious in this case because the two questions really are tightly coupled alternatives. However, consider the following: Are the lights green? Or is the switch up? Are the lights green, or is the switch up? Both of these examples imply that the state of the lights and the state of the switch are related somehow. Version 2 couples them more tightly; I would usually assume (without more context) that either this is the same question being asked in two different ways (i.e. that the switch being up should cause the lights to be green), or that they are an exhaustive list of possibilities (either the switch is up or the lights are green, but not both or neither). This isn't an absolute rule, but it is quite strongly implied. Example 4 is also wrong, though it has a better disguise. If you unwrap the quotes, what you get is: Should I write it like this? or perhaps like this? which is our duff example 2 back again. What you actually want is one of: ""Should I write it like this?"" he asked. ""Or perhaps like this?"" (i.e. example 1) ""Should I write it like this,"" he asked, ""or perhaps like that? (i.e. example 3) depending this time on how much of a break there is supposed to be in the middle of what was said. But speech-marking is a topic for another question :-) Exclamation marks work just like question marks for this purpose! Semicolons don't; they end a clause, not a sentence.

"input: Question: ""Vomit"" is not a recent addition to English, and nor does it have a peculiar pronunciation. Yet, the past tense of vomit does not follow the notion that a vowel followed by a consonant and emphasis on the consonant. (For example, past tense of 'emit' is 'emitted'.) 
Answer: The crucial thing is that the last but one syllable of ""vomited"" has no stress. Not even secondary stress. So the final consonant doesn't double. By contrast, the last but one syllable of ""emitted"" has stress (because the last syllable of ""emit"" has stress). This issue is raised in this question, to which a good answer is given. Compare: (No stress) marketed, budgeted, edited (Secondary stress) combatted, formatted (Primary stress) patted, petted, pitted, potted, rutted.

"input: Question: Is there a proverb that fits the following situation: John and Anderson (while walking): John: [sees a $100 bill lying in the road, and shouts] Yahoo! $100! Anderson: [takes the money and puts it into his pocket] Reflection: John exclaimed when he saw the money in the road, but he didn't try to take it. Anderson was smarter, as, when he saw John exclaiming, he took the money and put it into his pocket. Consequently, John now repents his foolish excitement. My question is, is there a proverb for such situations? EDIT: When I asked my friend, he suggested the following saying: ""Some feel the rain others just get wet."" 
Answer: One very common, albiet obnoxious phrase would be: Finders, keepers; Losers, weepers While this generally relates to the idea that once you find something that appears to be unowned - it is now your property - and not necessarily the idea of missing out on something, because you were too slow to act on it. It's such a common phrase in childhood, that it can be applied obnoxiously to imply ""now that I've picked it up, it's mine - you cannot complain about it"". In this case, the one who picked it up first would consider themself the ""Finder"" and the one who lost out on it (the original owner, and the person who was too slow to pick it up) would be considered the ""Loser"". Again, it's not a perfect phrase for this situation, but it is such a common idiom that it does get applied frequently to these kind of situations.

"input: Question: English isn't my mother tongue, and when we recently talked to a native speaker (during some company audit), he pointed out that the plural word ""trainings"" is actually wrong (he pointed that it is a very common mistake and was almost amused by it). I couldn't understand why and wondered what the correct plural of ""training"" would be. Online Dictionaries/Thesaurus don't answer it, so it's probably another opinion-based statement. I haven't found a source to back it up, though. 
Answer: I agree with Mick that training is an uncountable noun. In the example given by Mr. Fine of a specific training event allowing training to become countable, I disagree. In the case of becoming countable, the portion being counted is the event. Therefor, it would be ""there are multiple training events available at the pavilion"" (or whatever). I see many cases where much effort is made to ""fix"" the plural when a simple rewording will eliminate the contentious context and allow an, arguably, better flow by using the standard form.

"input: Question: Persistence and perseverance seem to have very similar definitions. Googling shows persistence: Firm or obstinate continuance in a course of action in spite of difficulty or opposition. perseverance: Steadfastness in doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success. What is the difference between them? 
Answer: ""Persistence"" is used in the sense of ""stubborn"" (obstinate). There could be a slight negative connotation. For example: The telemarketers persistently called us. We don't say they ""perseverantly"" called us. ""Persistent"" is used when there continuing action, and the purpose is either bad, or neutral, and sometimes(rarely) good. ""Perseverance"", is used when the purpose is good. That is, you're doing something to help someone, or to achieve a desirable goal, such as climbing Mt. Everest. Depending on how you feel on something, you could use ""perseverance""/""Persistence"". For example, the telemarketer calling you, could annoy you, and you could call him ""obstinately persistent"". But to the marketer, you might be to him, a tough customer, and he might seem to himself ""bravely perseverant in trying to persuade this tough customer."" As you can see, it gives a different ""feel"" about the thing described.

"input: Question: Possible Duplicate: Definite article with plural nouns I recently reviewed (as I believe, rather thoroughly) the rules of using articles in English and I do not recall any rule on absence of definitive article THE with plural nouns. Can you give me a reference on such a rule? 
Answer: Plural nouns with the definite article are, well, definite. Consider Cats don't like me. versus The cats don't like me. The former implies every cat on Earth doesn't like me; the latter, that some (contextually obvious) specific group of cats don't like me. ADDED In my opinion, yes, unmemorize that reference in your other question and memorize the following: use the definite article with a plural only to denote a known or stated subset of the class (""The elephants [in this zoo] are dangerous""); omit the article for the whole class (""Elephants [all of them] are dangerous""). Use an indefinite article with a singular to denote the whole class when you want to emphasize the singular nature (""A glass of wine is healthy, but two can lead to dissolution."") Use the definite article with a singular when referring to a specific instance or when you need, for some reason, to sound like Sir David Attenborough in a BBC nature documentary (""The elephant is a regal creature, reigning over his home, the savanna ...""). Of course, an indefinite article with a plural (""An elephants are dangerous"") and omitting articles with the singular of a countable noun (""Elephant is dangerous"") are both just wrong, wrong, wrong. Edit Two years later and I realize another rule: ""the"" is used to mark adjectives that have been promoted to nouns. When Paul Revere said, ""The British are coming"", he was referring to the British 10th Regiment of Foot, not to every subject of King George, so the ""the"" was de rigeur under the above rule. However, when Quentin Crisp wrote, ""The British do not expect happiness,"" he did mean every single Briton. The ""the"" is only necessary to make it clear that the word ""British"" is being used as a noun. With an ordinary noun, it would be different. ""Plumbers [all plumbers] do not expect happiness"" but ""The plumbers [in London] do not expect happiness."" Compare Jacques Brel's lyric, ""The naked and the dead should hold each others' hands"" with Dean Wormer's line, ""Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life."" ""Naked"" and ""dead"" are nouns (or adjectives being used as nouns); ""fat"", ""drunk"", and ""stupid"" are adjectives, which is why he uses ""is"" instead of ""are"": the subject of the verb is ""no way"".

"input: Question: Is there a word that describes or denotes a type of conversation in which two speakers speak two different languages. In our country, Pakistan, there are approximately 75 languages, from which Urdu, Punjabi and Sindhi are common, excluding English. So today I found two women speaking two different languages. For example: Speaker 1 has Urdu as their mother tongue. Speaker 2 has Sindhi as their mother tongue. Speaker 1 and 2 spoke their own mother tongue, which are different (Urdu and Sindhi) but both can understand each other's language. I thought that this is known as ""intermingling conversation,"" or a ""code switching."" In my opinion, we can't use such words because code-switching refers ""shifting completely to the other language for a word, a phrase or sentence, and then revert back to the base language."" Example sentences: They were in a bus and had [adjective] conversation. They were in a bus and had [noun or noun-phrase for such conversation]. I agree that the question (which is suspected as a duplicate one to this question) is really a duplicate, but its single answer still doesn't satisfy all. In that question, the phrase ""bilingual dialogue"" was suggested, which I (and others may) think that this refers to the code switching as well, which I don't want here. Some words confuse the readers which sense do they mean. I would also love to quote the comment of @Lambie regarding the term ""bilingual"" over here: ""Bilingual refers to one person. Not two people each of whom has a passive knowledge of the other's language but do not speak it well enough to use it actively."" 
Answer: In his book Talk in Two Languages, Joseph Gafaranga examines, among other things, the patterns of conversation within bilingual families. He calls the pattern described in the OP's question the parallel mode. Here is a screenshot from Google Books of the introduction to his discussion of the parallel mode pattern. So by Gafaranga's terminology the Urdu and Sindhi speakers were conducting a conversation in parallel (language) mode.

I just want it to be concise so that I can avoid variables like ""login_register"".

"input: Question: If I'm converting something from analogue to digital, I digitise it. What am I doing if I convert from digital to analogue? 
Answer: When I take a digital video or sound source and convert it to analog (for example by using a tape recorder to record an MP3) I am making an analog recording of the digital source. In earlier decades, recording a sound almost always meant making an analog recording by magnetic tape. For example, I might record a meeting with a tape recorder, or have a tape recording of a phone message on my answering machine. When digital recording started to become affordable and mainstream, the word digital was added to indicate that digital techniques were being used instead of the default analog (and of course for marketing reasons.) ""Hey check out my new digital voice recorder, I can record a whole day of classes without having to change a tape!"" Fast forward to today, and digital recording is standard, while analog is the unusual special case. Today, recording is assumed to be digital, unless you specify otherwise by saying it's an analog recording.

"input: Question: In technical literature as well as aircraft user interfaces where there is not enough space to write the whole word, the prefix ""trans"" is shortened to ""x"". Transmit -> Xmit Transfer -> Xfer I am interested to know what is the origin of this. I am curious because ""Ex"" and ""Trans"" do not have a similar sound. 
Answer: X is commonly used to refer to cross because of its shape of two lines crossing. Trans- means cross/across. Trans- and cross- are interchangeable in many cases. From Wikipedia (emphasis mine): In abbreviations, it can represent trans- (e.g. XMIT for 'transmit', XFER for 'transfer'), cross- (e.g. X-ing for 'crossing', XREF for 'cross-reference'), Christ- as shorthand for the labarum (e.g. Xmas for 'Christmas', Xian for 'Christian'), the crys- in 'crystal' (XTAL), or various words starting with ex- (e.g. XL for 'extra large', XOR for 'exclusive-or'). Example: a transatlantic flight is one that crosses the Atlantic, and something that is transdermal crosses through the skin. The trans- in transmit and transfer is analogous to transatlantic. Crossing a mit or a fer makes perfect sense. -Mit is from the Latin mittere which means to send. -Fer is from the Latin ferre which means to bear or carry. 'Transmit' often means to send across something or over a specific medium and 'transfer' can be to carry across from one to another. Therefore trans- is often replaced with X- in certain words.

"input: Question: Possible Duplicate: ""Did it close"" vs ""Has it closed""? As a English non-native speaker it is difficult for me to understand when I must use present perfect or past simple because in my official language there isn't the present perfect tense. I know that present perfect is related to something that happened in the past but its result is important now. But for instance: The message has been sent. The message was sent. Please help me point me out any examples/contexts where I should use 1. instead of 2. 
Answer: Think of the past tense as referring to an event that took place at a particular time in the past. In saying The message was sent, the speaker will normally have in mind something like yesterday or last week. The present perfect is called 'present' for a reason. The speaker is talking about the situation now, a situation in which a past event has some bearing on the present. For example, The message has been sent might be followed by a comment such as so it's too late to do anything about it now.

Some of the fun facts it mentioned included: The word Iouea, a genus of sea sponges, contains all five regular vowels and no other letters. [...] There are many words that feature all five regular vowels occurring only once in alphabetical order, the most common being abstemious and facetious.

(Actually some Southern American dialects pronounce ""which"" as [t], but that is only a difference in the ""w"" sound, not the /t/.) 
Answer: You've answered youself. Ch creates - among other pronunciations of this digraph - the sound tsh' which cannot be created otherwise. Like cheese, China and lots of other words. Sometimes it's used with t before, like in watch, scotch thus putting more stress on the t part of the sound.

"input: Question: Upon answering the telephone, the person calling asks if Joan is available. If Joan is the person who answered the phone, should she say ""This is her"" or ""This is she""? 
Answer: Traditional grammarians prefer the nominative (""she"") for the complement of the verb ""to be"". Most usage in my experience prefers the accusative (""her"") and regards the verb as having a direct object rather than a complement. I suspect the traditional grammarians, as they often did, have misapplied a rule of Latin grammar. In Latin, ""esse"" takes a complement in the nominative case, but Latin declines the verb strongly enough that it doesn't bother with a pronoun as the subject of a verb unless needed for emphasis. ""It is she"" in Latin would be ""illa id est"", which looks far more natural than the English. Note that it's ""c'est lui"" in French, so there isn't a general rule for a complement of ""to be"" being in the nominative. Explanation: A normal (transitive) verb, like say ""have"" has a direct object, which is in the accusative case. So, for example, ""I have her"" uses ""her"" as a direct object, and ""her"" is in the accusative case, where ""she"" is in the nominative case. In Latin, the verb ""esse"" (""to be"") is special; it doesn't have a direct object in the accusative case, it has a complement in the nominative case. English grammarians in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries adopted a number of rules of Latin grammar into English; this was one of them. In Latin, ""it is she"" and ""she is it"" are both the same thing ""id illa est"" or ""illa id est"" can both be translated either way - the point being that the ""is"" (""est"") just equates to things to each other - it's like in maths you can have x=y or y=x and they both mean the same thing. English, though, takes word-order very seriously, and a pronoun after a verb is very strongly marked as being in the objective case and you don't get the benefit that you get in Latin from the exception - there's still one before the verb and one after; you don't get to make clear that it's commutative. So you have a special-case for a verb, which you get no useful benefit from. It's hardly surprising that most English speakers have reverted to ""it is her"" rather than ""it is she"". A note on cases: Latin is conventionally described as having seven cases (though only five are actually different for most nouns and pronouns). It has two cases, accusative and dative for the objects of verbs. English's residual case system only has the one case for both, which merge into the objective case (in fact, a third Latin case, ablative, merges in too). That's why the two paragraphs above appear to use two different words for the same case.

"input: Question: I often read the expression ""would of"" used instead of ""would have"". Each time I read it I get annoyed so I googled it and found out -as I expected- that it is an incorrect way to say ""would have"". Now, there are a lot of brilliant slang words/expressions, so my question is, why do people use this one? It's so annoying to read, stupid and clearly wrong, it is pointless, why did they come up with this expression? Edit: I don't think my question is a duplicate as I didn't ask how can somebody use it (since I know it's incorrect and I know that I can use it with commas giving it a different meaning) but I asked why and how people came up with this expression. 
Answer: Correction: what annoys you is people writing ""would of"" when they are saying /wdv/, which is the standard pronunciation of the contraction would've. The vowel of the preposition ""of"" is almost always reduced in actual speech, yielding /v/. Thus ""would've"" and ""would of"" are homophones. So no surprise that some people spell it that way, even though it makes no grammatical sense. Would've can be even further reduced to /wd/, which some people spell woulda as a kind of phonetic eye dialect to represent actual speech or set an informal tone. The same goes for the modals, shoulda, coulda, musta. Spelling as it sounds can yield amusing results: Along the way the details of his past are sordid out and he realizes that what he once thought about his parents isn't the truth at all.

"input: Question: The word year when pronounced starts with a phonetic sound of e which is a vowel sound making it eligible for being preceded by an. Yet, we tend to write a year. Why? 
Answer: For the word 'year' to be preceded by 'an' it must sound like it's beginning with a vowel. The reason why it is a tad tricky is because of the difference in the way people pronounce it. Some people pronounce the word 'year' as 'ear' with 'y' silent, thereby wanting 'an' to precede and feeling discomfort with 'a'. e.g. 'It's been an _ear since we talked'. Whereas others pronounce it with a 'ye' sound in the beginning. In this case one finds that using 'a' suddenly sounds more comfortable. e.g. 'It's been a 'ye'ar since we talked'.

"input: Question: This question, ""Discrete Units of a Continuous Quantity"", asks whether units of a continuous quantity should be spoken of as discrete or continuous. The top answer states The rule is simple, and you obviously know it: discrete quantities require the use of ""fewer"" and continuous quantities require the use of ""less"". Calorie, as a unit, requires the use of ""fewer"". Energy, as a continuum, requires the use of ""less"". ""Fewer calories means less energy."" I do not understand the logic here though. Calorie is a unit, yes, but it is a continuous unit (it is possible to have half a calorie, or 4.582394 calories). Since a calorie is such a small unit of energy compared to what it is usually used for (food energy and human metabolism), it is very seldom expressed in a fractional form and instead is rounded (usually to the nearest 10 or higher). Why then should ""fewer"" be used with calorie instead of ""less""? Is there another relevant rule than just ""continuous quantities use ""less"" and discrete quantities use ""fewer""? 
Answer: Divisibility does not mean something is not countable or that it isn't a discrete unit, requiring use of 'fewer'. A calorie is not 'energy' it is a 'unit of energy', and therefore, countable and discrete, even though it's divisible. It's divisible into further discrete units - half a calorie, in this case, is still a discrete unit. Using another example, you would have 'fewer' jars of peanut butter, even though someone might have eaten half of the peanut butter in some of the jars. You could even cut the entire jar in half, none of that matters, you still have fewer jars. And you also have less peanut butter, in the same way that fewer calories means less energy. The calorie corresponds to the jar, not to the peanut butter (that would correspond to the energy the calorie measures). It doesn't matter that there is 'less' peanut butter in some jars than in others any more than it would matter if some of the jars were a gallon in size, and some were just single-use jars with two tablespoons of peanut butter inside. Put another way, your 'half a calorie' is still a unit, and thus, you'd still say 'fewer calories'.

"input: Question: This phrase is all over the internet. They will say that something is free as in 'free beer' and free as in 'free speech'. I have never really understood this. Are these the examples of two different types of 'free'? 
Answer: Wikipedia on Gratis versus Libre: Gratis versus libre is the distinction between two meanings of the English adjective ""free""; namely, ""for zero price"" (gratis) and ""with few or no restrictions"" (libre). The ambiguity of ""free"" can cause issues where the distinction is important, as it often is in dealing with laws concerning the use of information, such as copyright and patents. And further: With the advent of the free software movement, license schemes were created to give developers more freedom in terms of code sharing, commonly called open source or free and open source software. As the English adjective free does not distinguish between ""for zero price"" and ""liberty"", the phrases ""free as in free beer"" (gratis, freeware) and ""free as in free speech"" (libre, free software) were adopted. [...] ""Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of free as in free speech, not as in free beer."" Richard Stallman Emphasis added.

"input: Question: I debated with my peers that we can use the word emails when referring to more than one and it would be grammatically right. But most of them said since we don't say we received mails today, similarly we won't say we received emails . Quick advice please. 
Answer: Dan Bron's comment (above) that e-mail/email at its inception was treated as a mass noun is correctand so is Kristina Lopez's comment (above) that e-mail/email is widely applied today not just to the medium of electronic mail but to individual messages sent and received in that medium. For many years the technology magazines where I worked enforced a strict house rule: e-mail (and later email) referred to ""electronic mail"" as a mode of communication, and individual messages had to be termed ""e-mail [or email] messages."" But three or four years ago, the overwhelming weight of popular usage prevailed, and we began to accept the use of email as a singular noun that could take an indefinite article, and emails as a plural nounboth referring to individual messages. It is probably not coincidental that other forms of electronic communication receive similar treatment in popular (and some publishing) usage: a text and texts for ""a text message"" and ""text messages,"" respectively; and an IM and IMs for ""an instant messaging message"" and ""instant messaging messages"" (as I recall, people used to avoid ""instant messaging message"" by conflating the technology with the individual message to produce ""instant message""). At publishing houses, the proper handling of ""an e-mail [or email]"" versus ""an e-mail [or email] message"" remains a house style issuethere is no universally agreed-upon preference. If you are beholden to no one's style guide, you are free to use the wording that you like better. But the overall tendency, I believe, is toward accepting an email and emails as collapsed forms of ""an electronic mail message"" and ""electronic mail messages."".

"input: Question: Possible Duplicate: How do I say ""Our meeting is preponed""? A friend of mine asked me this question, and it caught my curiosity. Is there an explicit opposite of the word postpone? As in, do something in advance? Clearly what I just said is functionally equivalent to the answer I am seeking, but I was wondering if there was a single word that is the antonym. More context: Bob was supposed to start work in July, but due to a work visa issue, he had to begin in advance. 
Answer: The most business-speaky option is expedite. Other alternatives include accelerate, hasten, and advance. Technically prepone is in fact the precise antonym, but I honestly wouldn't be caught dead using it.
output: ",yes
"input: Question: ""The worst student"" is the student who is bad at things. In this case, ""worst"" simply describes the noun. Following this logic, your ""worst enemy"" would be the person who is very bad at being your enemy, thus is actually your best friend. Your ""worst enemy"" is actually the enemy who is very good at being your enemy. Thus, in this context, ""worst"" acts to amplify the inherent negative intent of the noun. ""Worst disaster"" would be another example of this. Is this just a matter of context or there some science behind the interprettation of a negative adjective applied to a negative noun? 
Answer: The meaning is often seeming obvious and clear, but is contextual rather than strictly logical, and can be subjective and up to the speaker to decide and to communicate effectively. To use your example, ""worst"" in ""the worst student"" doesn't necessarily ""simply describe the noun"". e.g. it could be either something like: ""Ralph was the worst student this term, attending only half the classes and failing the test."" (i.e. he was worst at the class requirements) or ""Of all the ill-mannered students, Jason was the worst student Mathilda had ever encountered."" (i.e. Jason was the worst behaved) A clearer example of this possibility might be: ""Sam received a bad blow to the face."" (it's bad because the speaker sympathizes with Sam) vs. ""Bob landed a good blow on the monster's wing."" (it's good because the speaker is siding with Bob).

"input: Question: Are Backronym and Acronym same? I don't understand the difference between these two terms. 
Answer: A ""backronym"" is a ""backward"" acronym. It is a word or expression that is formed from an already existing word. An example is ""SAD"" = (Seasonal Affective Disorder). So, yes, they are different.

"input: Question: What is the difference between ""parentheses"" and ""parenthesis""? 
Answer: Parenthesis is of course Greek and means in fact ""insertion"". It has taken the meaning of the signs "" ( "" or "" ) "". Parentheses is the regular plural. Usually, you use a pair of the signs showing an insertion, then ""between parentheses"" - or brackets ; however, ""in parenthesis"" means : as an afterthought.

"input: Question: In Russian we have the term """". I would translate it as ""asshands"" which literally means that your hands grow out of your behind and you can't do anything right (or do anything at all). Example: Dad: ""Hey son, can you hang up this picture on the wall?"" Son: ""No dad, my hands grow out of my behind, I'll probably end up hanging it upside down"" (Or ""I am a _____"" - i.e. the term I'm looking for.) Is there anything similar in English? Is the term ""screw up"" the one? Or are there any other ones? I want slang specifically, preferably American. 
Answer: There is a word we use called Nixie. It comes from the German word Nichtse which means a slacker/good-for-nothing. The word is very popular among the Pennsylvania Dutch community.

"input: Question: I've found this phrase here on a recent BBC report: ""...the mare in the video died after suffering a cardiac arrest on a gallops in April 2016."" The same article has: ""A video on social media shows James mount the animal at a gallops while some present can be heard laughing."" (emphasis mine) It's a bit of a sad story, but I want to know what ""a gallops"" is. Google Ngrams has some indication that it might be a phrase rather than just a typo, and also that it might be rising in popularity. TheFreeDictionary redirects me to gallop. I know what ""a gallop"" is. It's the plural noun (""a gallops"") that I have never heard used before. It feels like some kind of horse racing meet. Any formal (or informal) definition that fits this word? Is it short for something? 
Answer: A gallops (or sometimes gallop) is a track or ground specially designed for training or exercising horses - see definition 1.3 here. They usually have a special surface, and might consist of a straight or circular track, often with a fence or rails. Note that this is a British English phrase, equivalent to the American English phrase ""training track"".

"input: Question: In Afrikaans, it is considered very disrespectful to use ""you"" ( ""jy"") when referring to someone who is above the level of a peer. Instead, it is expected that you use ""u"", which is a very respectful form of ""you"". Also you can talk in the third person ""How is ma'am today"" would be the equivalent. I cringe internally when I say ""How are you"" to someone older than me, because in Afrikaans it would be very rude. I was bought up to only ever refer to my parents in the third person. ""how is mom today"", ""what is dad doing"" when speaking in Afrikaans. The lack of English equivalent feels very wrong and disrespectful. What is the best way to convey this in English? I have been reassured that saying ""you"" to a parent isn't rude, and I understand that this can be cultural, but I'm particularly looking for what options English offers in this regard, as far as existing vocabulary, that convey respect. I'm in South Africa. 
Answer: I think the US, respect tends to be expressed with posture, attitude, and content of what you say rather than with the use of specific words. Formalisms such as specific honorifics tend to feel stilted (although as others have noted, there are regional variations), but wouldn't be offensive.

"input: Question: Is there a name for these kind of doubled words? For example: hanky-panky flim-flam hoity-toity boo-hoo zig-zag Note that some rhyme and others do not. 
Answer: I believe the word you're looking for is reduplication. From Wikipedia: Reduplication in linguistics is a morphological process in which the root or stem of a word (or part of it) or even the whole word is repeated exactly or with a slight change. Wiktionary gives specific types: Exact type: acute-null accents; baby-talk-like bye-bye, choo-choo, night night, no-no, pee-pee, poo-poo, etc. Ablaut type: acute-grave accents, high-low vowels, front-back vowels. bric-a-brac, chit-chat, criss-cross, kitty-cat, knick-knack, jibber-jabber, splish-splash, zig-zag, sing-song, etc. Rhymed type: acute-acute accents, varied initials. claptrap, hokey-pokey, honey bunny, razzle-dazzle, slim jim, super-duper, teeny-weeny, wingding, etc.

"input: Question: What's a word that means ""not knowing everything""? This would serve as a complementary antonym of omniscient, which means having infinite knowledge, or simply ""all-knowing"". Thesaurus.com shows these possible words: stupid (opposite of being clever, which = being omniscient) unknowing (opposite of being knowing, which = being omniscient) fallible (opposite of being infallible, which means ""not able to make mistakes"", which = being omniscient, since I can know everything and still make mistakes) erring (which means ""capable of making mistakes"", which = being omniscient, since I can know everything and still make mistakes) imperfect (opposite of being perfect, which is a superset of being omniscient... how could I be perfect if I'm both omniscient and fallible?) faulty (which means ""to have fault(s) / defect(s)"", is the opposite of ""to have no fault(s) / defect(s)"", which means being perfect, which = being omniscient) ignorant (which means ""having inadequate knowledge"", is the opposite of ""having adequate knowledge"", which = having infinite knowledge) uneducated (opposite of being educated, which = being omniscient) unaware (opposite of being aware, which = being omniscient) uninformed (opposite of being informed, which = being omniscient) Yet, none of them are true antonyms for omniscient. Is there an alternative? 
Answer: I suggest that ignorant is the opposite.

"input: Question: I understand the capitalization rule for nouns, proper nouns require a capital letter. Also, I should begin a new sentence with a capital letter. When & why ""mom/dad"" requires a capital letter ? (Reference- ELL- I am at Vapi where mom is hospitalised) mom: (n) informal term for a mother/North American term for mum. 
Answer: When it is their name, Mom and Dad would be capitalised: Dear Mom and Dad, I am just writing to let you know, that although everyone has a mom and a >dad, you are my special mom and dad. So, Mom, I just want to say 'brava!'; and Dad, 'bravo!'. I've just been telling Sis, that Mom's new coat is so cool. XX Here's the commentary from an exercise from BBC English on Line ...to have a roast chicken lunch with my mother. I can't wait! - mother does not need a capital 'M' as it is not being used to replace her name. If I said, ""I am going to lunch with Mum"", it would need a capital letter, but ""I am going to lunch with my mum"" does not.

"input: Question: Once when I was having a hard time a guy said to me, ""I'm sorry you're having a hard time, I'll pray for you,"" in a way that made it clear that he was glad I was having a hard time because it gave him the opportunity to pray for me and feel good about himself. I am interested in this phenomenon but also the much more general (probably universal) phenomenon of human beings finding justification for things they want to do, often by lying to themselves about the utility of the behavior to other people. The best single word I can think of for this is contrived, but it is not close to precise. Similarly, dissembling, insincere, and so on don't really cut it. I also looked at this list of cognitive biases but was unable to find one that expressed this idea. Is there a single word for this? If not, a short phrase? 
Answer: I suggest ""unconscious fallaciousness"" ""fallacious"" (adj) - tending to deceive or mislead : delusive MW.

"input: Question: The meaning of Polish 'doing something on knees' or 'on a knee' is completely different than English:  s://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/on-your-knees It is rather a metaphor to a student who instead of doing his homework properly at the home, he did it in hurry, supported his notebook on knees and did it in a short break between classes. In other words it means doing something in hurry, usually resulting in poor quality and unsophisticated enough. Some usage: Who designed this building? Looks like some architect 'made it on a knee'... Or nowadays according to software engineering: There are lots of bugs in this application! They came short on deadlines and 'wrote it on their knees' even without unit tests... My question is, is there an English equivalent (in idiom or phrase) which preserves this meaning better? Edit After reading some answers I realized that my examples were a little bit misleading. In reality, the phrase does not carry itself any negative connotations about the 'author'. Rather poor quality of his job results. The only negative connotations about author we can only deduce from the quality of his job: 'He did his job inaccurately so we can assume that he may be inaccurate.' or 'You Will Know Them by Their Fruits' sort of thing.
