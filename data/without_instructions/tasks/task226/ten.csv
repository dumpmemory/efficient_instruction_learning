"input: Question: Most grammar checkers are capable of detecting the the misuse of ""your"" and ""you're""; providing the necessary correction. I'm curious though, is there any sentence that can be constructed where replacing ""your"" with ""you're"" keeps the sentence grammatically correct, but changes the meaning? If this is not possible, what grammar rules are in place that prevents these edge cases from occurring? 
Answer: a. I love you and your bananas. b. I love you and you're bananas. This particular case depends on the your/you're coming after an independent clause followed by ""and,"" since its feasibility depends on functioning either as a second direct object or as another independent clause. It also depends on the noun serving either as a thing that someone might be in possession of (the bananas we eat) or as an adjective or noun complement describing a person (bananas=crazy). Easiest if that noun is plural or uncountable. The same sentence could be constructed with nuts, garbage, and other nouns which I'll let you brainstorm because my stormer hurts. You can also (and thanks to @Barmar for drawing attention to this) use verbs, in which case they act as a gerund with the possessive pronoun and a present participle with the ""you're."" As in: a. I love you and your cooking. b. I love you and you're cooking. Or: a. I despise you and your smoking. b. I despise you and you're smoking.

"input: Question: I was told in a Latin class that the name Christopher has Greek roots that mean ""one who carries Christ"". I assume that the Latin connection here is fero, which is the verb to carry. With that in mind, does the name Jennifer have a similar derivation? If so what would she be carrying? 
Answer: It's a perfect example of a false cognate pair that is created by a sort of linguistic homogenization. When we come across foreign words, we pronounce them with our own sounds, mapping a foreign sound to one natural to our own ear that seems close enough for our purposes. Unrelated sounds and syllables from unrelated languages might in this way each get mapped to a single native sound/syllable. In this way, we come to hear the sounds and syllables as related when they are not. Mesoamerican languages, for instance, did not have a ""v"" sound. Consequently, when learning Spanish, the natives of Central America had a devil of time with the fairly common v sound and ended up usually pronouncing it as a b. The b sound is related to the v sound, so it wasn't a subtle shift. In consequence, very often to this day words like ""votar"" (to vote) get pronounced identically with words like ""botar"" (to throw out) giving rise to numerous puns. When native Spanish speakers from Latin America learn English, they are often heard saying things like ""Thank you bery much,"" as a result. But ""bery,"" and its false homophones ""berry"" and ""bury"" have no shared ancestry. As a last point of interest, consider English spelling. It is so difficult precisely because speakers of English and the academic sources that safeguard the English language (Oxford English Dictionary, Merriam-Webster Dictionary, etc.) have made a general decision to preserve as best as possible the original spelling of the words in their original languages, making only occasional modifications to bring them into some kind of conventional conformity. So the Greek suffix - is conventionally transliterated as -pher, whereas the ending of Gwenhwyfar gets transliterated as -fer and the ending of aquifer stays as the Romans wrote it: -fer. This makes our spelling a bear to get a handle of, but it also locks the secret of most words' origins right into the words themselves. That means, once one has understood a bit of Latin, Greek, some common Celtic endings and a bit of German, one can almost always discern the origins of the word just by looking at it. Of course, it also means that we have to spend years and years memorizing spelling word lists and still relying on spellchecker far more than we care to admit.

"input: Question: Possible Duplicate: Types of things vs. types of thing When using the phrase ""types of"" or ""kinds of,"" it often seems appropriate to follow with a singular noun (e.g., types of rock), but at other times a plural noun sounds better (e.g., types of sentences). Is there some kind of rule about this? 
Answer: Here's a rule of thumb with which to decide the correct usage in any given case. Turn the phrase around: I like all kinds of music = I like music of all kinds I like all kinds of apple = I like apple of all kinds I like all kinds of apples = I like apples of all kinds And so on.

"input: Question: If someone is asked to do something important, they might say ""I'll prioritize that"". But if someone is asked to put something aside to work on something else more important, what could they say? In the past I've used ""de-prioritize"", but I'm not sure if that's actually a word. Is it a word? Is there some other way to get this point across? 
Answer: How about overlook, disorganize, or neglect?.

"input: Question: This is a question for English wordsmiths. Is there a word that ""feels"" like the word ""ethereal"" that means something ethereal that quickly disappears. Or is ""ethereal"" the correct word choice for this? Ethereal was the first word that popped into my head for this. From the various definitions that I've looked at for ethereal, it says delicate, beautiful, heavenly, etc. but not necessarily quickly vanishing, except for the secondary definitions related to ether that suggests it evaporates. I'm just wondering if there is a better word than this. I'm using the term ""ethereal skill"" to describe a certain type of pilot skill (instrument flying) that requires tremendous practice to achieve proficiency, and once proficiency is achieved it is a beautiful thing, but if you don't practice it regularly, that skill vanishes after a few weeks. USAGE: Instrument proficiency is an ethereal skill that once obtained must be maintained through constant and regular practice. 
Answer: evanescent is a good match - definitions focus on loss and vaporous qualities. It seems to be applied most often to the loss of things with positive connotation. MW defines it with : ""tending to vanish like vapor"", Cambridge with ""lasting for only a short time, then disappearing quickly and being forgotten"" Century Dictionary Online has a number of useful definitions and quotes. I like ""Vanishing or apt to vanish or be dissipated, like vapor; passing away; fleeting: as, the pleasures and joys of life are evanescent. Also from Century, this quote: ""He [Wordsworth] seems to have caught and fixed forever in immutable grace the most evanescent and intangible of our intuitions, the very ripple-marks on the remotest shores of being."" - Lowell, Among my Books.

"input: Question: Wikipedia says: A postscript may be a sentence, a paragraph, or occasionally many paragraphs added to, often hastily and incidentally, after the signature of a letter or (sometimes) the main body of an essay or book. When all letters were handwritten, and adding a new thought to the letter would have likely involved rewriting the entire letter, a postscript had obvious practicality. Now, however, one can just as easily add the thought to the main text. 
Answer: You seem to have answered your own question, but it's perhaps worth pointing out that in both email and conventional mail a postscript can be a consciously chosen device for drawing attention to what it contains. What might look like an afterthought to the reader might be a deliberate ploy by the writer.

"input: Question: I want to ask whether I can use the word ""Fuck"" in a formal context. Apparently, the word dates back to the early 16th century, so it shouldn't be considered slang (although, it is misused as slang for other reasons), but regardless of its vulgarity, could I use it in a formal context with its original definition? I imagine that people will be surprised, but when realizing in what context I am using it in, then it will be more understandable and acceptable to use it. Firstly, I do not even know the definition of the word due to its vastness in meaning, I always thought it was an exclamation-like word meaning nothing (for it to mean sexual activities is a slang definition, is that not correct?), but used purely for emphasis. What does it first and foremost mean in its original/accurate and/or formal definition? I also know of another definition of the word ""Fuck,"" which is ""I will fuck you"" as in ""I will defeat you"" (in context of fighting or combat), is that a formal definition as well? I mainly ask for this, because I need to use the word in this context, specifically and especially. Also, side question, is it possible not to always make it a vulgar word? Thanks in advance. 
Answer: It is very unwise to use ""fuck"" in any formal context whatsover (outside of technical discussion of language). The word either has strong and forceful sexual meaning, or it has the debased banality of over-frequent use by those groups of society who lack nuances and who express themselves repetitively and coarsely. In neither case does the usage fit with formal discourse. In short, although an excellent word to describe a very pleasant and necessary activity, it is rude.

"input: Question: I've found that expression on a website, and I don't understand it. At first I thought it was because the canary is yellow and the coal black... but it doesn't make much sense. 
Answer: Miners used canaries to detect carbon monoxide and other gases in the mines. As long as the canaries continued to sing, the miners were safe. If the canary died, they'd evacuate the miners. I didn't see a reference included in your posting so lacking the context of the quote, I'd go out on a limb to say that what is meant is either literally a reference to that practice of gas detection or it is some sort of metaphor for some sort of early warning system as in the example below. An example of how this expression can be used metaphorically, from wisegeek.com: ""Today, the practice of using a bird to test the air supply has become part of coal mining lore, but the ideology behind it has become a popular expression. The phrase ""living like a canary in a coal mine"" often refers to serving as a warning to others. The actual canary had little control over its fate, but it continued to sing anyway. In one sense, living this way indicates a willingness to experience life's dangers without compromise."".

"input: Question: I know that Sussex and Middlesex are in England. It looks to me as if there is a pattern in names. What does the suffix -sex mean? Where does it come from? 
Answer: The -sex suffix is from Anglo-Saxon / Old English, with the actual meaning being ""Saxon"". Sussex is essentially ""South Saxon"". Middlesex is ""Middle Saxon"". Essex is ""East Saxon"". Wessex is ""West Saxon"". Most of the wiki pages for these places will have the toponymy definition.
