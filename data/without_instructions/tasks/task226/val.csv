"input: Question: What is the meaning of wrt in the following text? I think this is an excellent idea, but I'd like to see this explicitly reframed under the banner of providing Drupal.org data through publicly-accessible APIs. We started kicking off at least one discussion like that wrt Git over, which also led back to ""#112805: XML-RPC Interface"". 
Answer: It's an abbreviation for ""with respect to"". Edit: regarding the lack of punctuation (thanks for bringing it up, ukayer), that's definitely because of the informal nature of the context. It would be more standard to write it as w.r.t., except that in any context where punctuation matters, you probably shouldn't use this abbreviation in the first place.

"input: Question: Somehow I am compelled to use the word ""metal"" to describe strong ""intestinal fortitude"", and perseverance however I can't find the spelling or any synonym like this. Does a word that sounds like ""metal"" exist when describing an individual's character? I'm looking for modern or historic usage of the word. 
Answer: Mettle Defined by Oxford Dictionaries as: a person's ability to cope well with difficulties; spirit and resilience. It is commonly seen in the phrase: (put someone) on their mettle meaning, (of a demanding situation) test someone's ability to face difficulties. 'there were regular public meetings where local MPs were put on their mettle and remorselessly pilloried' Source: ODO Other constructions are possible too, for example: test their mettle, apparently an American version (thanks, @PeterCordes) show your mettle, etc. Origins According to Merriam-Webster, mettle was, as @Sparhawk points out in the comments, originally simply a variant spelling of the word metal (which dates to at least the 13th century), and it was used in all of the same senses as its metallic relative. Over time, however, mettle came to be used mainly in figurative senses referring to the quality of someone's character, with a first known usage in 1581. Today, both words can mean ""vigor and strength of spirit or temperament,"" but only metal is used of metallic substances.

"input: Question: Is the following correct, or is there more to it? ""I forgot his name"" I knew his name, but I forgot it. ""I forget his name"" I keep forgetting his name. Where using ""forget"" basically means that you tried to remember this information before as well, but you couldn't then either. 
Answer: I forgot his name means I've permanently forgotten, while I forget his name means I've temporarily forgotten even though I expect to be able to remember. In a few more minutes I'll probably remember. See also the phrases ""slipped my mind"" or ""the tip of my tongue"".

"input: Question: ""Hooker"", ""whore"", and ""prostitute"" all mean whore; what are the differences between them? 
Answer: They all can mean women who sleep with men for money. Prostitute is the most technical term. Hooker seems most commonly used in the United States, while in Britain this term is reserved for a position in rugby. Whore sounds much more violent to me. If one were seeking a woman to pay to sleep with him, he probably wouldn't say ""I'm looking for a whore tonight,"" but use hooker or prostitute. Calling someone a whore can be used to insult them, implying they sleep with many people (though for men the term would be man-whore). E.g., ""She is such a whore."" Going back to a previous example, ""I'm looking for a whore tonight"" implies more to me that he is looking for someone who is easy to sleep with, not for a prostitute. Not to say you can't use the others in an insult. From ""Baby Got Back,"" by Sir Mix-A-Lot, we also have the opening dialogue: They only talk to her, because, she looks like a total prostitute, 'kay? But in this case the lady quoted is just saying that she looks like a prostitute, not that she is one, necessarily. If she said ""She is such a prostitute,"" that would mean that is her profession, not that she sleeps with a lot of men for free.

"input: Question: This year there were: many more people much more people Alternatively: many fewer people much fewer people Which is considered better English? 
Answer: According to Google Books Ngram Viewer, COCA, Ludwig and storywrangler, ""many more people"" is much more frequently used than ""much more people"". A search on the NOW corpus shows that ""many more"" modifies countable nouns while ""much more"" is followed by uncountable nouns in most cases. Grammatical rules do not work here. In ""many more people"", ""many"" pretends to function as an adverb, but in fact it is still an adjective. Keep in mind that language is not science. If many people use ""many more people "", it will be grammatically correct eventually.

"input: Question: Could you tell me some suitable idioms to express this situation: A guy told you a joke, but it's not funny at all. In Japanese, we say ""He slipped"" or ""His joke was so cold that the air got frozen,"" for that situation. Are there any similar phrases in English? 
Answer: A common expression for this is to fall flat (from the ""idioms"" section of thefreedictionary.com): fall flat if an entertainment or a joke falls flat, people do not enjoy it and do not think it is funny Several attempts at humour during his speech fell flat. if an attempt to influence people's behaviour or opinions falls flat, it fails The advertising campaign which had worked so well in the US fell flat in China. The statement that pregnancy is not an illness falls flat with many morning sickness sufferers. The first meaning is the one you're after, so you could say: I told a joke but it fell flat.

"input: Question: What can I call someone (a friend) who is always asking for favours such as: if you are going downtown, can you buy this for me please or, can you lend me your car for an hour or, if you have some spare time, can you post this letter for me please because I am so busy today He doesn't seem to realise or, pretends not to, that there is a limit to asking for help or favours from other people. 
Answer: You can say that your friend is ""using"" you, as to describe their behavior of taking advantage of you, thus making them a ""user."".

"input: Question: I'm a non-native English speaker, and my automatic spellchecker seems to accept both therefore and therefor. Is one orthography preferred ? Is that a British vs. American difference ? Or an old vs. more recent orthography ? Or something else ? 
Answer: Therefor means for that. For example: Here we sell guitars and accessories therefor. Therefor is one of a whole series of adverbs: thereof (of that), thereafter(after that), therein (in there), etc. If you are familiar with German - the Germanic sister of English - you can find a direct analogy there: for = fur therefor, for that = dafur (literally, therefor) Therefore, as you must know, means as a (logical) consequence.

"input: Question: I want to describe: a job-position that is given to someone as a way to appease the person, but the position holds no real function. Context: He was, due to his importance to the secret project, offered an honorary ____ with disproportionally lucrative payment. The job is given by the authority to the person as a way to basically bribe him with undeserved salary, because he won't be given any real task. The emphasis here is payment, and not power, so ""figurehead"" would be inappropriate. 
Answer: You could maybe use pencil pusher (informal, often derogatory) One who does routine office work; someone involved mainly in paperwork.
output: ",no
"input: Question: I was googling the reason for why it's called ""shotgun"" to ride beside the driver when it suddenly hit me - why on Earth is the firearm called ""shotgun""?! Is there any other kind of a gun than one used for shooting?! Why is it called ""shotgun"" instead of just a ""gun"" or a more technical term (9-gauge, barrel gun etc.)? 
Answer: There are other things that shoot 'shot'. Cannons fired grapeshot as an effective way to deal with infantry. This makes a 'shotgun' just a gun that shoots shot instead of a cannon that does so. This clever naming scheme is also visible for 'rifles' which are simply guns with barrels that have been rifled.
