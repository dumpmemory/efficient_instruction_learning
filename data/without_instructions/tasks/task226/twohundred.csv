"input: Question: Most grammar checkers are capable of detecting the the misuse of ""your"" and ""you're""; providing the necessary correction. I'm curious though, is there any sentence that can be constructed where replacing ""your"" with ""you're"" keeps the sentence grammatically correct, but changes the meaning? If this is not possible, what grammar rules are in place that prevents these edge cases from occurring? 
Answer: a. I love you and your bananas. b. I love you and you're bananas. This particular case depends on the your/you're coming after an independent clause followed by ""and,"" since its feasibility depends on functioning either as a second direct object or as another independent clause. It also depends on the noun serving either as a thing that someone might be in possession of (the bananas we eat) or as an adjective or noun complement describing a person (bananas=crazy). Easiest if that noun is plural or uncountable. The same sentence could be constructed with nuts, garbage, and other nouns which I'll let you brainstorm because my stormer hurts. You can also (and thanks to @Barmar for drawing attention to this) use verbs, in which case they act as a gerund with the possessive pronoun and a present participle with the ""you're."" As in: a. I love you and your cooking. b. I love you and you're cooking. Or: a. I despise you and your smoking. b. I despise you and you're smoking.

"input: Question: I was told in a Latin class that the name Christopher has Greek roots that mean ""one who carries Christ"". I assume that the Latin connection here is fero, which is the verb to carry. With that in mind, does the name Jennifer have a similar derivation? If so what would she be carrying? 
Answer: It's a perfect example of a false cognate pair that is created by a sort of linguistic homogenization. When we come across foreign words, we pronounce them with our own sounds, mapping a foreign sound to one natural to our own ear that seems close enough for our purposes. Unrelated sounds and syllables from unrelated languages might in this way each get mapped to a single native sound/syllable. In this way, we come to hear the sounds and syllables as related when they are not. Mesoamerican languages, for instance, did not have a ""v"" sound. Consequently, when learning Spanish, the natives of Central America had a devil of time with the fairly common v sound and ended up usually pronouncing it as a b. The b sound is related to the v sound, so it wasn't a subtle shift. In consequence, very often to this day words like ""votar"" (to vote) get pronounced identically with words like ""botar"" (to throw out) giving rise to numerous puns. When native Spanish speakers from Latin America learn English, they are often heard saying things like ""Thank you bery much,"" as a result. But ""bery,"" and its false homophones ""berry"" and ""bury"" have no shared ancestry. As a last point of interest, consider English spelling. It is so difficult precisely because speakers of English and the academic sources that safeguard the English language (Oxford English Dictionary, Merriam-Webster Dictionary, etc.) have made a general decision to preserve as best as possible the original spelling of the words in their original languages, making only occasional modifications to bring them into some kind of conventional conformity. So the Greek suffix - is conventionally transliterated as -pher, whereas the ending of Gwenhwyfar gets transliterated as -fer and the ending of aquifer stays as the Romans wrote it: -fer. This makes our spelling a bear to get a handle of, but it also locks the secret of most words' origins right into the words themselves. That means, once one has understood a bit of Latin, Greek, some common Celtic endings and a bit of German, one can almost always discern the origins of the word just by looking at it. Of course, it also means that we have to spend years and years memorizing spelling word lists and still relying on spellchecker far more than we care to admit.

"input: Question: Possible Duplicate: Types of things vs. types of thing When using the phrase ""types of"" or ""kinds of,"" it often seems appropriate to follow with a singular noun (e.g., types of rock), but at other times a plural noun sounds better (e.g., types of sentences). Is there some kind of rule about this? 
Answer: Here's a rule of thumb with which to decide the correct usage in any given case. Turn the phrase around: I like all kinds of music = I like music of all kinds I like all kinds of apple = I like apple of all kinds I like all kinds of apples = I like apples of all kinds And so on.

"input: Question: This is a question for English wordsmiths. Is there a word that ""feels"" like the word ""ethereal"" that means something ethereal that quickly disappears. Or is ""ethereal"" the correct word choice for this? Ethereal was the first word that popped into my head for this. From the various definitions that I've looked at for ethereal, it says delicate, beautiful, heavenly, etc. but not necessarily quickly vanishing, except for the secondary definitions related to ether that suggests it evaporates. I'm just wondering if there is a better word than this. I'm using the term ""ethereal skill"" to describe a certain type of pilot skill (instrument flying) that requires tremendous practice to achieve proficiency, and once proficiency is achieved it is a beautiful thing, but if you don't practice it regularly, that skill vanishes after a few weeks. USAGE: Instrument proficiency is an ethereal skill that once obtained must be maintained through constant and regular practice. 
Answer: evanescent is a good match - definitions focus on loss and vaporous qualities. It seems to be applied most often to the loss of things with positive connotation. MW defines it with : ""tending to vanish like vapor"", Cambridge with ""lasting for only a short time, then disappearing quickly and being forgotten"" Century Dictionary Online has a number of useful definitions and quotes. I like ""Vanishing or apt to vanish or be dissipated, like vapor; passing away; fleeting: as, the pleasures and joys of life are evanescent. Also from Century, this quote: ""He [Wordsworth] seems to have caught and fixed forever in immutable grace the most evanescent and intangible of our intuitions, the very ripple-marks on the remotest shores of being."" - Lowell, Among my Books.

"input: Question: Wikipedia says: A postscript may be a sentence, a paragraph, or occasionally many paragraphs added to, often hastily and incidentally, after the signature of a letter or (sometimes) the main body of an essay or book. When all letters were handwritten, and adding a new thought to the letter would have likely involved rewriting the entire letter, a postscript had obvious practicality. Now, however, one can just as easily add the thought to the main text. 
Answer: You seem to have answered your own question, but it's perhaps worth pointing out that in both email and conventional mail a postscript can be a consciously chosen device for drawing attention to what it contains. What might look like an afterthought to the reader might be a deliberate ploy by the writer.

"input: Question: I want to ask whether I can use the word ""Fuck"" in a formal context. Apparently, the word dates back to the early 16th century, so it shouldn't be considered slang (although, it is misused as slang for other reasons), but regardless of its vulgarity, could I use it in a formal context with its original definition? I imagine that people will be surprised, but when realizing in what context I am using it in, then it will be more understandable and acceptable to use it. Firstly, I do not even know the definition of the word due to its vastness in meaning, I always thought it was an exclamation-like word meaning nothing (for it to mean sexual activities is a slang definition, is that not correct?), but used purely for emphasis. What does it first and foremost mean in its original/accurate and/or formal definition? I also know of another definition of the word ""Fuck,"" which is ""I will fuck you"" as in ""I will defeat you"" (in context of fighting or combat), is that a formal definition as well? I mainly ask for this, because I need to use the word in this context, specifically and especially. Also, side question, is it possible not to always make it a vulgar word? Thanks in advance. 
Answer: It is very unwise to use ""fuck"" in any formal context whatsover (outside of technical discussion of language). The word either has strong and forceful sexual meaning, or it has the debased banality of over-frequent use by those groups of society who lack nuances and who express themselves repetitively and coarsely. In neither case does the usage fit with formal discourse. In short, although an excellent word to describe a very pleasant and necessary activity, it is rude.

"input: Question: I've found that expression on a website, and I don't understand it. At first I thought it was because the canary is yellow and the coal black... but it doesn't make much sense. 
Answer: Miners used canaries to detect carbon monoxide and other gases in the mines. As long as the canaries continued to sing, the miners were safe. If the canary died, they'd evacuate the miners. I didn't see a reference included in your posting so lacking the context of the quote, I'd go out on a limb to say that what is meant is either literally a reference to that practice of gas detection or it is some sort of metaphor for some sort of early warning system as in the example below. An example of how this expression can be used metaphorically, from wisegeek.com: ""Today, the practice of using a bird to test the air supply has become part of coal mining lore, but the ideology behind it has become a popular expression. The phrase ""living like a canary in a coal mine"" often refers to serving as a warning to others. The actual canary had little control over its fate, but it continued to sing anyway. In one sense, living this way indicates a willingness to experience life's dangers without compromise."".

"input: Question: I know that Sussex and Middlesex are in England. It looks to me as if there is a pattern in names. What does the suffix -sex mean? Where does it come from? 
Answer: The -sex suffix is from Anglo-Saxon / Old English, with the actual meaning being ""Saxon"". Sussex is essentially ""South Saxon"". Middlesex is ""Middle Saxon"". Essex is ""East Saxon"". Wessex is ""West Saxon"". Most of the wiki pages for these places will have the toponymy definition.

"input: Question: ""The worst student"" is the student who is bad at things. In this case, ""worst"" simply describes the noun. Following this logic, your ""worst enemy"" would be the person who is very bad at being your enemy, thus is actually your best friend. Your ""worst enemy"" is actually the enemy who is very good at being your enemy. Thus, in this context, ""worst"" acts to amplify the inherent negative intent of the noun. ""Worst disaster"" would be another example of this. Is this just a matter of context or there some science behind the interprettation of a negative adjective applied to a negative noun? 
Answer: Don't confuse English language with the mathematical theory. The adjective worst qualifies the noun enemy with even more bad values. So, a worst enemy is more dangerous than a normal enemy.

"input: Question: We were discussing something like pre-boss era, post-boss era. What word describes the era where the boss is still there? 
Answer: Peri-boss era. This prefix allows you to create delightfully clear parallel construction that covers all cases: pre-, before peri-, during post-, after Google [ pre- post- peri- ] for examples ""in the wild"". These prefixes are popular in medical terminology, such as pre-, peri-, and post-anesthesia.

"input: Question: The question is quite straightforward: Which of the following is preferable? ""I keep myself up-to-date on the latest technology."" ""I keep myself up to date on the latest technology."" 
Answer: The simple answer is that the non-hyphenated version is more appropriate - and more commonly used - in the example sentence that you give. The hyphenated version is more commonly seen as a compound adjective, sometimes as a jargon phrase. Indeed, I have seen it used as a perjorative, sarcastic term, although that is not common usage. So in summary, up-to-date is used as an adjective describing a condition or status of an object or document, while up to date is used to describe a state of mind or a fashion.

"input: Question: Whenever I hear statements like ""It was a great deal for he and I"" and ""Call Karen and I in the morning,"" I die a little. Such solecisms, as Twain said in another context (Cooper's prose style), ""grate upon the fastidious ear."" Moreover, I know that these things will likely become accepted usage in time, if that hasn't already happened. As someone who tries to be careful with words and speech, I feel almost a moral obligation to hold the line against this kind of decline. I'm not a word snob; I say ""ain't"" when it works for emphasis, and so on. I've tried suggesting the grammatical alternative to the above constructions, but even when I phrase my suggestion in the gentlest possible way it never works well and I almost always wind up feeling pedantic and priggish at best, and at worst I feel I've alienated someone. What's the general opinion here? Is it best to just let these things slide or to take up the fight? In sum, is there a good way to promote good grammar, or at least protect it from the most egregious violations? 
Answer: There is nothing wrong with having gut reactions to the way that people say things. I am completely aware that the standard/educated version of a language is arbitrary (i.e. is no more ""correct"" in any real sense than any dialect), and even still, I have pet peeves and things that irk me about people's language usage. I think these are unavoidable, just like my reaction to certain fashion choices that people make in their outfits. But, like with fashion, there is very little objective truth to my judgment about any of it. I try not to actually challenge people on uses that bother me; aside from the arbitrariness of language, every bit of evidence suggests that stopping language change in any significant way is like going to the beach and trying to stop the tide from coming in. There was a more in-depth discussion about this in a previous question. That said, I do believe there is a certain time and place where standards and clarity are important. In formal contexts, information is often supposed to be presented in a certain way, and, generally, these conventions benefit everyone. Also, following certain language conventions in these situations can eliminate ambiguity. If I am asked to proofread an academic paper that my colleague has written, I would make corrections for things that I would never object to otherwise.

Answer: Food in its commonest sense is a non-countable noun, with all the effects of that. It's already a plural. You would eat ""some food"" not ""a food"". You would say ""less food"" not ""fewer foods"". However, there is a less common usage where ""a food"" means ""a type of food"": ""Cheese is a food made from milk"" ... and in this form, you can pluralise it ...

Answer: ""It is me"" is ungrammatical. Transitive verbs, like speak take a subject and an object. Thus, You (subject) will speak to me. (object) The verb to be is not transitive, but copular. It takes a subject and predicate. Thus, It (subject) is I. (predicate) Also, it must be We'll soon find out who (subject) is who (predicate.) rather than We'll soon find out who (subject) is whom (object.) Edit: Please see @krubo's excellent answer below.

There seems to be two camps: The word plethora indicates plural, so therefore it should be ""There are a plethora""; and the other camp says that there is only one plethora (which contains multiple), so it should be ""There is a plethora"". I've seen many examples of both. Is there a consensus, or is it just one of those things that can go either way? 
Answer: A plethora is singular, so one must say ""there is a plethora of..."" just as one would say ""there is a bunch..."" If you are dealing in several plethoras, you could use the plural: ""there are plethoras of..."" but this feels very contrived and artificial.

"input: Question: The US emergency telephone number 911 seems to be almost always pronounced as nine one one whereas the Porsche model is typically pronounced as nine eleven One reason I can think of for preferring ""nine one one"" for the phone number is that there is no ""eleven"" key on a phone. On the other hand, ""0800"" is often pronounced ""o eight hundred"". Is there a logical or historical reason for the different pronunciations? 
Answer: How a car manufacturer names its models is more of a marketing preference than anything, but in general you'll find that the Porche model is the norm. Ask any schoolchild to read aloud the number ""911"" and you'll get ""nine hundred and eleven"", not ""nine one one"". The telephone number 9-1-1 was, as you speculated, spelled out specifically to prevent people - particularly children - from getting confused looking for the ""eleven"" key on the telephone. I have heard this anecdotally countless times, but I'm having a hard time finding an authoritative source. Closest I can come are various ""history of 911"" websites like this one: Dr. Phil Shaenman, head of the U.S. Fire Administration's research department, authored a paper explaining that children should be taught to dial ""nine-one-one,"" and not ""nine-eleven.""

"input: Question: Is there a single word to describe birds that can fly? Am I struggling to think of a word because the default notion of a bird is that it can fly? So we generally only need to differentiate the ones that can't fly. I've seen the term ""winged"" in a few google searches, but to my mind an ostrich is winged, but it is also flightless. I guess I'm looking for the word you'd put into this blank: Penguins are flightless because they cannot fly. Ostriches are flightless because they cannot fly. Pigeons are ____ because they can fly. 
Answer: I think you can just use flying to describe them; flying birds sounds perfectly normal and isn't a tautology, nor does it only apply to birds in the air, cf. the title of the Wikipedia article 'Flying and gliding animals'. It's obviously an awkward choice for your example sentence, where another option, volant, could be used instead: 2: flying or capable of flying (source: Merriam-Webster).

Answer: There is a common acronym for this, used in computing and engineering, which is COTS - ""commercial off-the-shelf"" - i.e. you can buy it ready made without having to do any research to invent it yourself, and without needing to understand every detail of how it works. It is rather old, but COTS technology.

"input: Question: Possible Duplicate: This question has been asked at/on SO? Which sentence is grammatically correct? The papers are freely available at the journal website. The papers are freely available on the journal website. Using Google's search results: available at the website returns 72,800,000 results. available on the website returns 106,000,000 results. So, I inferred that both variants are popular. Is this method (comparing the number of results by Googling) sound? 
Answer: Speaking as a longtime computer geek, files are said to reside on a hard drive or on a certain machine. Since I know that a website is made of computer files, I think of a website as being on a machine and so any part of the website is also on that machine. A website's ""address"" is a ""Uniform Resource Locator"" or URL. These terms connote the idea of website as ""place"". In this case the file would be at the website location. So, if you think of a website as it is actually constructed (files stored on hard drives), you will probably say on. If you think in the location metaphor, you will probably say at. Personally I find myself saying ""on"" to other geeks and falling into ""at"" when speaking with normal people.

"input: Question: On a Physics specification, it says: 6.7 Know how to use two permanent magnets to produce a uniform magnetic field pattern. Isn't it ""produce an uniform magnetic field"", or is the existing ""produce a uniform magnetic field pattern"" correct? 
Answer: The word uniform begins with a palatal approximant /j/. The palatal approximant is a consonantal sound, even though the letter itself is a vowel. Since we use the pronunciation of the word following the article to determine whether we use ""a"" or ""an"", and because it is pronounced starting with a consonant, we use ""a"". Thus, the original sentence is correct. Just for the sake of completeness, the letter ""u"" can also have a vowel sound, such as in the word ""umbrella"", which begins with an open-mid back unrounded vowel //.

"input: Question: Is the word ""Customizable"" a valid English word? Every time I write that word, the spell checker underlines it, and it suggests using ""Customization"" or ""Customize"". I'm not a native English speaker, but that word exists in online dictionaries so I wonder why the spell checker underlines it. 
Answer: The Oxford English Dictionary in its revision of March 2012 defines it as: That may be customized; able to be changed to suit the requirements of the user. Frequently with reference to computer software and hardware. The earliest citation is from 1960. If that definition of customizable suits your purpose, then there's no reason why you shouldn't use it.

"input: Question: Is it correct to say ""Wish you a happy weekend"" or should I say ""Wishing you a happy weekend""? 
Answer: Neither Wishing you a happy weekend nor Wish you a happy weekend would be used in normal conversation. As others have noted, spoken parting platitudes at the end of a week are normally started with have, such as: Have a good weekend Have a nice weekend etc. Change the adjective to be what you think most appropriate for the situation. On the other hand, if you are signing off some correspondence, such as an email, then Wishing you a happy weekend is more appropriate. Similar constructions include Wishing you a happy birthday Wishing you a merry Christmas Wishing you well To use *Wish you a happy weekend you need to add I to make the sentence grammatical. i.e. I wish you a happy weekend. A notable exception to this is the common postcard sign off Wish you were here where it is idiomatic to leave out the I.

"input: Question: I was googling the reason for why it's called ""shotgun"" to ride beside the driver when it suddenly hit me - why on Earth is the firearm called ""shotgun""?! Is there any other kind of a gun than one used for shooting?! Why is it called ""shotgun"" instead of just a ""gun"" or a more technical term (9-gauge, barrel gun etc.)?

Transmit -> Xmit Transfer -> Xfer I am interested to know what is the origin of this. I am curious because ""Ex"" and ""Trans"" do not have a similar sound. 
Answer: In addition to the other edifying answers and comments: from an information-theory viewpoint, given the rarity of initial ""x"" in English words, the presence of it (especially if unpronounceable) is a clear signal that there is something at play slightly out of the ordinary, and it will not be easily mistaken for anything else. That is, information-theory-wise, the chance of misunderstanding is low (more technically/precisely, the error-correction properties of this usage are excellent).

"input: Question: It is common in American English to refer to a powerful person or organization as an 800 pound gorilla. The expression makes sense -- a gorilla of that size would certainly be intimidating -- but what's so special about the number 800? Searching ""n lb gorilla"" on Google for various values of n results in many more hits when n = 800 than when n is any other quantity. Also, the Google Ngram Viewer finds notable occurrences of the phrase ""800 pound gorilla"" in texts starting around the late 1970s; other sized gorillas don't seem to be mentioned at all. The Wikipedia entry for the idiom claims that the phrase is rooted in a riddle (""Where does an 800lb gorilla sleep?""), but that's just passing the buck. A 700lb or 900lb gorilla would be equally entitled to sleep wherever he wants to. Interestingly, the Wikipedia entry for gorilla states that the average male gorilla weighs about 400lb, occasionally reaching 500lb in the wild. Only obese gorillas in captivity have attained weights of 600lb. So the number doesn't even seem to be related to gorilla biology (except that it is safely larger than any known gorilla, save King Kong). Given that it's an arbitrary figure, is there any reason the number 800 would be more popular than any other? More generally, is there any relevant research into why some numbers would be more popular or pleasing than other in contexts like this? 
Answer: Quite large gorillas in the wild are at most 550 pounds; so an 800 pound gorilla is one that's oversized, even fat. As Wikipedia states, this phrase first originated with a riddle, ""Where does an 800 pound gorilla sleep?"" Ans: ""Anywhere it wants."" Because this is the standard idiom, when people want to speak hyperbolically they will sometimes exaggerate the number to ""1,000 pound gorilla"", or some other, even larger number. In short: no, the number 800 does not have any special significance, except perhaps with reference to the typical (male) gorilla's average weight (450 pounds).

Answer: Are you sure to delete this item? Sure means ""certain, without doubt"". Therefore this asks if they are definitely going to delete the item. This isn't something to ask the user; if anything it's something for the user to ask about the program; ""will it definitely be gone"". Are you sure you want to delete this item?

"input: Question: is it 'a usual' or 'an usual'? 'A usual' sounds more correct in my head ('Today was a usual day.') than 'an usual', but u is a vowel. Which one is correct and why? 
Answer: Usual (pronounced /ju.u.l/ as in you) begins with a consonant sound and, as such, it should be preceded by a not an. As an aside, I cannot help but point out that the sentence Today was a usual day is not usually heard in regular conversation. Today was an unusual day is what one might hear, instead! Indeed, I rarely hear the construction a usual. The definite article is more commonly used, in my experience: That's the usual thing. In place of a usual, one would also be more likely to hear not an unusual: Today was a usual day / Today was not an unusual day This is a usual occurrence / This is not an unusal occurrence or This usually happens You are right in saying that a usual sounds weird. As speakers, we tend to avoid constructions which, though correct, do not flow easily from the mouth. In sum, the following are valid and commonly used alternatives: not [an] unusual the usual usually.

"input: Question: There is a person in my current daily life who never admits his wrongs. He is always quick to blame others first and always believes that he is not wrong. Even when he is proven wrong, he still believes he shouldn't be sorry and isn't wrong. Is there a single-word adjective to describe this behavior? If not, a better way to describe this person would also make do. While stubborn and irresponsible fit, I feel like they don't tell the whole story. By this, I mean if I were to say to others that he is very stubborn and irresponsible, it is not implicitly implied that he blames others and never acknowledges his own fault. Edit: I believe my question is different because the person will also never acknowledge their wrongdoing. On top of blaming others, even after it has been proven to be their fault, they will not admit wrong doing. So aside from blaming others, they refuse to acknowledge the possibility that they have committed a mistake. 
Answer: If he calls attention to the same thing when someone else does it, the word would be hypocrite. Otherwise, weasel seems to have the connotation (when I hear it used) of falsely accusing someone in order to avoid being found out, though I don't see that specified in the definition.

"input: Question: How did 7 come to be an abbreviation for 'and' in Old English? is a beautiful question about the Tiroian ""et"", which is now the """" character 1. My question is what impact did the association of this 7-like-glyph have on the eventual placement of keyboards placing the & on Shift+7 combination? The Wikipedia article on the QUERTY keyboard shows that the ampersand was a separate key in the bottom left of the keyboard in the original patent application drawings. The patent was filed in 1878. The Das Keyboard blog shows a Full Duplex keyboard (with separate keys for upper and lower case letters) from 1897 with no ampersand key at all. I have not yet been able to find a reference to the first keyboard to place the ampersand and 7 together. The Wiki article on the ampersand only mentions that it is usually keyed via Shift+7, but occasionally on 6 or 8 instead. Dvorak layouts appear to share similar associations between 7 and &. So is it a coincidence? Or is there some association? 1 This looks really different in the EL&U site fontface. See the linked question or the Wikipedia article for more faithful renderings. 
Answer: Although the 7 was the ampersand on IBM's standard keyboard layout, that is hardly universal. The first nine printable characters in ASCII are ! "" # $ % & ' ( ), which should give a good clue as to what the top row of a teletype keyboard looked like. On many early teletypes and terminals (and also, BTW, on the Apple ][), the shift key toggled bit 4 of the character being produced, thus it would turn a 1 (011 0001) into ! (010 0001), and , (010 1100) into < (011 1100). Since the digits 1-9 received consecutive code, so did the characters produced by combining them with the shift key. Shift-7 on those keyboards was apostrophe; the ampersand was shift-6. Other typewriter keyboards also varied considerably in where they put the ampersand. Its association with the number 7 is nowhere near as consistent as the association between 1 and !, 3 and #, 4 and $, or 5 and % which existed in both older computer keyboards and today's US arrangement.

But I don't have any idea how can I write a proper email with such a greeting in English? Or do I have to ignore it because the email is kinda formal? 
Answer: I almost always start formal e-mails with Dear Professor _, I hope this note finds you well. Some guidelines will suggest ending your salutation with a colon rather than a comma, but in many circumstances a comma is acceptable. If the person's title is ""professor,"" you should spell it out (not ""prof."") and begin it with a capital letter when it precedes the person's name (as it would in your example). ""I hope this note (or letter) finds you well"" politely establishes a friendly connection between you and the recipient of your letter and in most circumstances is a great way to start it. Especially if you're asking for something, it's good to indicate your concern for the person you're writing to. For the same reason, it's a good idea to end the letter with a phrase or sentence that will similarly show interest in their work or their well-being. ""Best regards,"" is fine, but if you can tailor it in a way that's a bit more thoughtful, it's better. ""I hope your book/project continues to go smoothly."" (This can be followed by a ""Best regards."") If this is a person you don't know, you may have to settle for a generic ""Best regards"" alone.

Answer: As everybody has said, to take a stab at means to attempt. I want to additionally note here that I believe it to be related to the idiom stab in the dark, meaning an attempt at something with little guidance or hope of success. It doesn't carry the full weight of that meaning, though, just an attenuated implication of not necessarily knowing what one is doing, more likely used as mild self-deprecating humor than anything else.

"input: Question: I was told in a Latin class that the name Christopher has Greek roots that mean ""one who carries Christ"". I assume that the Latin connection here is fero, which is the verb to carry. With that in mind, does the name Jennifer have a similar derivation? If so what would she be carrying? 
Answer: No Jennifer is from From a Cornish form of the Welsh name Gwenhwyfar (see GUINEVERE). This name has only been common outside of Cornwall since the beginning of the 20th century, after it was featured in George Bernard Shaw's play 'The Doctor's Dilemma' (1906). GUINEVERE From the Norman French form of the Welsh name Gwenhwyfar, composed of the elements gwen meaning ""fair, white"" and hwyfar meaning ""smooth"". In Arthurian legend she was the beautiful wife of King Arthur who engaged in an adulterous affair with Sir Lancelot. Her betrayal of her husband with Mordred prompted the battle of Camlann, which led to the deaths of both Mordred and Arthur. The Cornish form of this name, Jennifer, has become popular in the English-speaking world.

"input: Question: What's the difference in meaning between ""register"" and ""registry""? Can both be used interchangeably when talking about an official (public) list of items, records? 
Answer: The online oxford dict says: Register noun official list or record, for example of births, marriages, and deaths, of shipping, or of historic places. a book or record of attendance, for example of students in a class or school or guests in a hotel. Registry: noun (plural registries) a place or office where registers or records are kept. But yeah, it also says that a registry too can mean a list. And I think 'Registry' is used more in the former context than the later. Even while talking in context of computers we say things like 'Windows Registry'. For me, the word register brings along a sense of being finite but registry does not. like when I think of a register of records, I usually get a quantified picture of the records list comes to my mind, like a page, or a notebook. but 'registry' brings along a picture of non quantifiable !! or its just weird with me.

Answer: ""finishing"" means reaching the end of some process, ""finalizing"" means declaring the end of some process. After finishing, nothing needs to be done any more, after finalizing, nothing is to be done any more. Finishing a specification means ending the process of drafting it, finalizing a specification means ending the process of refining it into a state fit for formal adoption.

Example: ""He likes to contrast his checkered jacket with plain pants"" or ""his checkered jacket contrasts with his plain pants."" But when we say ""in contrast to"", it is behaving as a noun.

I was under the impression that farthest is strictly speaking in terms of distance, whereas furthest is more abstract. A poster on this forum gives the following example: The further [quantity] you walk, the farther [distance] you get. What gives? 
Answer: The NOAD I had on my Mac Mini reported the following note, which is the same note found on the Oxford Living Dictionaries about farther and farthest. Traditionally, farther and farthest were used in referring to physical distance: the falls were still two or three miles farther up the path. Further and furthest were restricted to figurative or abstract senses: we decided to consider the matter further. Although farther and farthest are still restricted to measurable distances, further and furthest are now common in both senses: put those plants the furthest from the window.

In my understanding, off of should usually be replaced by off, as in, I took the book off the shelf as opposed to I took the book off of the shelf Am I wrong? Or is there perhaps some simple way I can explain this to most people? 
Answer: How can I explain to people that the phrase ""off of"" is grammatically incorrect? You can't, because it's not. There are thousands of examples of ""off of"" in the Corpus of Contemporary American English, not just in spoken English, but in magazines, newspapers, and academic journals as well. ""Off of"" is well-established as standard in American English. Plain ""off"" may be stylistically preferable in many cases, but it is simply not a rule of English grammar that if a word could be removed it must be removed. Some people seem to think that such a rule exists. It does not.

"input: Question: Whenever I hear statements like ""It was a great deal for he and I"" and ""Call Karen and I in the morning,"" I die a little. Such solecisms, as Twain said in another context (Cooper's prose style), ""grate upon the fastidious ear."" Moreover, I know that these things will likely become accepted usage in time, if that hasn't already happened. As someone who tries to be careful with words and speech, I feel almost a moral obligation to hold the line against this kind of decline. I'm not a word snob; I say ""ain't"" when it works for emphasis, and so on. I've tried suggesting the grammatical alternative to the above constructions, but even when I phrase my suggestion in the gentlest possible way it never works well and I almost always wind up feeling pedantic and priggish at best, and at worst I feel I've alienated someone. What's the general opinion here? Is it best to just let these things slide or to take up the fight? In sum, is there a good way to promote good grammar, or at least protect it from the most egregious violations? 
Answer: Does the grammatical faux pas compromise or endanger the communication, or is it merely annoying? (Annoying to you personally, of course. The speaker, and no doubt many others are perfectly happy with it.) Language can be a delight, but it is also, and to many, merely a means to an end. If you are with friends who enjoy language for its own sake and who want to improve their understanding and usage of it, a courteous and appropriate correction will be appreciated. If you are with strangers or persons with whom you have only a business relationship, then as long as the communication is not jeopardized you're probably best advised to bite your tongue and realize that you are a member of a small minority. Unless, of course, you really do wish to be viewed as a snob.

Answer: Yes, placing yourself at the beginning is improper grammar. As far as why, I don't know. It just is. To me, it always sounded self-centered to begin a sentence or list of people with myself. I imagine that is the genesis of the rule but I have no idea. It makes someone sound pretty uneducated to do it, though.

Answer: Particular seasons are temporal elements, in exactly the same way as a day of the week or a month of the year. They pinpoint a specific region of time. As such, seasons should be capitalized. However, the actual word 'season' (like any generic time period), should not be capitalized, as a particular time period is not being specified. Examples: In many areas, school now starts in the middle of Summer, technically. -- We're planning a trip for sometime next season. The next tournament isn't until November. -- There is an event planned every month. Your car will be ready on Wednesday. -- Your order should get to you in a few days.

"input: Question: Is there a semantic difference between engine and motor? In some cases, would the use of one or the other word be technically incorrect? 
Answer: I like the definitions provided by WordNet and their definition is the way I've understood the difference: A motor is a machine that converts other forms of energy into mechanical energy and so imparts motion. An engine is a motor that converts thermal energy to mechanical work. wordnetweb.princeton.edu So an engine is a specific type of motor. That's why it's not incorrect to speak of a motorboat, or a motorcar, or a motor speedway, even if the boat or car is clearly powered by combustion. Note that if there's no combustion, there's no engine. Purely electric cars don't have engines. As nouns, motor can also refer to a nonspecific agent that causes motion: ""happiness is the aim of all men and the motor of all action"", and engine can refer to something used to achieve a purpose: ""an engine of change"", a railway locomotive, or a machine used in warfare: ""medieval engines of war"".

"input: Question: I just realized there are some people around my workplace who always try to correct me when using a certain word, saying that that's not how I should speak, and I should use other words (the ones they provide me with) or pretend they didn't understand what I was saying, but it's pretty clear that they did understand. This again with the same purpose, of making me rephrase, or use the words they expect. When doing this, they use, among others, the argument that they sure have understood, but others might not. But then, nobody else complains of not having understood what I was saying. Another argument they use is that even if they understood it, what I said was incorrect. I make the assumption that when I express my ideas in words, I use enough details to get the point across. I would call this type of non-constructive attitude a 'hater' attitude, but I'm curious whether there's a more specific word for this. meta: I'm not a native English speaker, and I don't know a word for this in my language, I'd just use the dictionary to find out if my language has an analogous word. Anyway it would be good to know if there's a word for this concept in these two languages. meta: Also, the situations I refer to happen (mostly) when I'm speaking my own language, but the language really isn't the point here, because I do speak multiple languages and I did meet this behavior (though very rarely) when speaking any language.

"input: Question: Is penultimate commonly used in English, or are its variations (such as second to last) more common? I need to use it in conjunction with the expressions First Payment Date and Last Payment Date to name variables while programming. In my mother language (Portuguese) Penultimate Payment Date would be fine, but it feels strange in English. (I know feels strange is not very helpful, but I'd like to know how to convey the meaning in the most natural way.) 
Answer: Someone I know who is a native speaker of Spanish and a professor at a university in the United States has complained that when he used the word ""penultimate"" in class, the students don't know what he's talking about. The word is perfectly, unimpeachably, 100% correct. It is a bit of an upscale, literary word though. It certainly is a ""term of art"" in fields like linguistics, where it is used commonly to refer to syllables. I searched for the word in the Corpus of Contemporary American English, and divided the results by section: spoken, fiction, magazine, newspaper, and academic, and got these results: spoken: 10 fiction: 53 magazine: 55 newspaper: 36 academic: 93 total: 247 So, it is certainly used in all areas of English, with a moderate skew towards higher registers like academic writing. Depending on the intended audience, a writer contemplating using the word ""penultimate"" should consider that there is a relatively high likelihood that word will not be understood. Instead of ""penultimate"", the phrasing in common usage is either ""next to last"" or ""second to last"". Both of those should be universally understood. Interestingly, Google Ngrams shows that the word ""penultimate"" rose in usage (in published books) steadily from 1800 to about 1990, and since 1990 it has shown a steep dropoff, taking us back to usage levels from the late 1960s. The better-understood terms ""second to last"" and ""next to last"" are less common (again, though, in published booksGoogle Ngrams tells us nothing about spoken usage), with ""next to last"" having more historical usage but a slow tapering off of usage since 1960 and ""second to last"" increasing in usage from 1970 on, with both enjoying approximately the same usage today.

"input: Question: There are many English words with silent letters, words like gnome or island that are spelt with consonants that aren't pronounced, but are there any words that work the other way round, with a pronunciation that includes extra sounds or syllables that are not in the spelling? I can't think of any real examples, hence this question, but a made-up example would be if gnome were spelt nome but pronounced with a g at the start. Or if people started pronouncing offer as ""ofter"" as a sort of weird parallel to after. Note: I don't mean words like rough, where the f sound is spelt gh, because in those cases the spelling does still include letters (however seemingly illogical) for each of the sounds. 
Answer: The name ""Stephen"" is pronounced as ""Steven"", that is, ""ph"" is pronounced ""v"", which is unexpected. Some notes: ""ph"" is normally pronounced ""f"", and both ""v"" and ""f"" are labiodental fricatives, so this strange pronunciation doesn't come entirely out of the blue. The name can also be spelt ""Steven"" (e.g. Steven Tyler), thus matching the pronunciation. Admittedly, this is not exactly what you are asking for (it's like ""colonel"", where ""lo"" is pronounced as an ""r""), but since you consider colonel ""in an adjacent neighbourhood"", you might be interested in ""Stephen"" as well.

"input: Question: I saw an article today that prompted a thought. I only took a year of Latin in high school, so I want to run this by some other people. The article referenced a female senator so-and-so. However, I think that senator, with the -or ending is in the nominative, third declension, which is not gender neutral. So, when referring to a female subject, should senatrix be used instead? Also, does anyone know if there is a reason why the male form is used exclusively? I think females were restricted from the Roman senate perhaps the term just never made sense etymologically because of this? 
Answer: A number of answers have addressed the fact that in the United States, the use of gender-specific nouns is becoming less fashionable. However, that does not explain why a female equivalent of senator has never existed, only why if it did exist once, it might be less favoured now. I try to answer the etymological question here in relation to senatrix. There is no classical support for senatrix. The word senator was, both originally in English and in Latin, an expression referring exclusively to males, simply for the unfortunate dearth of female senators. In classical Rome, a senator (Latin senator) was always a man, and when the word later came to be used to refer to members of foreign legislatures, to my knowledge all such references were to men. Indeed senator itself essentially meant 'elderly man', from senex, 'old, elderly'. The obvious female equivalent, senatrix, does appear in Lewis & Short, but a brief search on Perseus suggests it is not attested in any major classical source. Of course, Rome had two famous female senators in the tenth century mediaeval senate (or what was left of it), and indeed senatrix was the formal title used by Theorda and Marozia, her daughter*. But they are an anomaly, and were I think of little interest when the word senator was imported into English and first popularized. Therefore we begin with a situation in which anyone who read Latin would know that senatrix was not a classical word, and those of us who delight in imposing arcane Latin grammar rules on unsuspecting English speakers are equally reluctant to pollute the lexicon with artificial Latin words [and anything after August 476 AD doesn't count]. On the use of senatrice in French. The French word sometimes used for a female senator (senatrice) appears to be a backformation from senateur + -trice rather than derived directly from *senatrix. That said, senatrice is long established in the French language, appearing in the 1762 edition of the dictionnaire de L'Academie francaise. This is curious, as in 1762 the ancien regime remained strong and the date long precedes the the establishment of the French Senat in 1799. However my knowledge of French and France is embarrassingly poor, so all I shall say is that 1762 is long after the word senator appeared in English. Therefore senator had become an English word by this time, and I suggest that the continuing evolution of its cognate in French would have had limited effect on the use of senator in English. The Academie francaise now discourages the use of senatrice. There is little use of senatrix at any time in English. A Google Ngram search reveals that senatrix did have a brief period of use in the early twentieth century, around the time that the notion of female senators entered the public discourse. However, a more detailed inspection reveals that this seems to be an upswing in interest about Theodora and Marozia, rather than in the composition of the modern legislature. In that search I did find one tantalizing reference to the 'senatrix from Kansas', but as the reference dates from 1898, eighty years before the first female senator from Kansas, and is entitled 'Judge's Library: A Monthly Magazine of Fun', it cannot be taken at face value. senatrix has little in the way of a history and less in the way of a future. Lacking a sound etymological past, senatrix was not popular among those most likely to have adopted it; and until 1932 there was regrettably very little need for the word to be used at all in popular discourse. As the other answers carefully elucidate, in English, particularly American English, there is a trend away from long-established gender-specific words, so it seems quite unlikely we will see the adoption of any artificial ones any time soon. *You may recall that Gibbon famously describes them in Decline and Fall as 'sister prostitutes', but later sources are quite clear that they were mother and daughter. Gibbon does not use the word senatrix as far as I can see.

"input: Question: Is there a word or phrase which describes ""choice of misleading words"", or the negation: ""choice of non-misleading words""? The nearest phrases I can think of are linguistic deception, or controlled language, as in Nineteen Eighty-Four. For example, Richard Stallman actively opposes such misuse of language: I think it is ok for authors (please let's not call them creators, they are not gods) to ask for money for copies of their works (please let's not devalue these works by calling them content) in order to gain income (the term compensation falsely implies it is a matter of making up for some kind of damages). Another example is ""credit"" in banking, which just makes ""debt"" sound like a good thing. EDIT: The term may either refer to an individual's malicious use of misleading terminology, or to widely-accepted use of misleading terminology. The answers reflect this, but my question does not. 
Answer: I'm not sure if you're looking for a verb meaning ""to use misleading words"" or if you're looking for a noun referring to the misleading words themselves or the act of using misleading words. Either way, consider an adjective: Disingenuous disingenuous (adj). Lacking in candor. Also : giving a false appearance of simple frankness: CALCULATING. (From Merriam-Webster online) While I'm not finding this (explicitly) in any dictionary definitions, I'm also used to ""disingenuous"" carrying a connotation of being manipulative or sneaky.

"input: Question: I live in Australia, but am expected to use US English in my work. I am therefore used to spelling ""-ise"" as ""-ize"". I was a little surprised to find that ""enterprise"" is almost universally spelt with ""-ise"". Is there any particular reason that this is the case for this example, when ""-ize"" is so widely preferred in US English? 
Answer: For one, because the etymology is different. -ise (-ize) is a causative suffix in formalise, realise etc. (to make something formal, to make something real...) But enterprise is not ""to make something enterpre"" or similar (whatever that might mean). The prise bit comes as a past participle of French prendre (to grasp, to take). Another answer is that enterprize is actually attested, and was apparently used more than enterprise in the second half of 18th century (N-gram viewer).

Incompetent people can misuse terminology all day and the ideas are effective and do technically work.

What word if not used competently could end up leading to injury or death in a context that most people could understand with little-to-no explanation? 
Answer: This may not be exactly what you are looking for, but might work in the context. inflammable Many people see the ""in"" as a negative prefix, and believe anything marked inflammable is flame retardant. However, both flammable and inflammable have the same meaning: ...both mean ""capable of being easily ignited and of burning quickly."" This makes no sense to the Modern English speaker. In English, we think of in- as a prefix that means ""not"": inactive means ""not active,"" inconclusive means ""not conclusive,"" inconsiderate means ""not considerate.""

Answer: Don't discount the simplest explanation: that there may actually be a place called Salt Mines, which should have been capitalized. For instance, there is a place called Salt Mines here, in Northern Ireland. It's not a salt mine any more: it's a park, which has cycling routes / jumps, with a golf course and so on nearby. In other words, it's a place where people hang out; a place where two people might very well see each other later. This is all assuming that you didn't leave out the word ""the"", of course. If it's ""see you at the salt mines"", then yes, they're probably calling the school a salt mine, as a half-joke.

Answer: Please don't! In those sensible countries whose worker economy does not rely predominantly upon the random generosity of strangers (which never made any sense to me at all, but there we go), the cost of item X is C(X) and C(X) is what the till comes up with when you hit the button for X.

And then all you're going to do is put D-C(X) in a little jar anyway. At best it takes a moment to figure out; at worst it ruins the end-of-day take calculations when a take of T is no longer equal to C(X)*N(X) across all items X. It could even throw off a stock check if executed sufficiently poorly by front-line staff.

"input: Question: I am writing a report where I want to say something like: The number of structures in the PDB has been steadily increasing, with nearly 140 thousand structures currently available. However, this number feigns in comparison to the number of unique protein sequences that have been discovered, with over 210 million unique sequences present in the UniParc database. However, I am not sure about the ""this number feigns in comparison to"" part. I have a feeling that I am using the wrong word here, but googling around didn't give me any leads. 
Answer: I thought I would leave the following as I typed it, but I have changed my mind. Ideally, one would say that, ""the [protein] is an order of magnitude greater "". Unfortunately, this would require re-ordering the paragraph, and the current order is better. So skip to after the (second) line. For my money, ""pales etc."" is just not a strong enough expression here. ""Pales in comparison with"", I venture is used when the first case is impressive, but the second case is so much greater that it makes the first case look entirely unimpressive. An example might be that company X has 140,000 PDB structures, but company Y has 600,000; it is not just somewhat better, but indeed makes the other look er, pale. Again: ""I can run the mile in 7:05, but this pales in comparison with Matthew, who can do it in 5:17."" I would suggest here, perhaps, ""is an order of magnitude smaller than"". This is about, for example, 10^5 vs 10^6, or 10^5 vs 10^7. (One can resort to saying, ""several orders of magnitude"" if comparing (e.g.) computer storage in 1980 with computer storage today.) I would say that the expression, ""pales in comparison with"", connotes [implies] the same order of magnitude connotes that the things being compared might have been expected to be about the same my mile in 7:05 is pretty good for a typical person, but Matthew is an elite athlete who has been training for a year. (This is not to say that you can not say, ""pales in comparison with"", about something that is 1/10th as good; one might say, ""The {imaginary machine gun} fires 400 rounds per minute, but that pales in comparison with the {imaginary machine gun}, which fires 5000 rounds per minute"" although (again) these are both machine guns.) That is to say that although 140 thousand is indeed impressive (I venture) it is implicit that they are of the same order of magnitude. I am thinking, then, that you might say, ""pales into insignificance beside"" [noting that Michael Harvey mentioned this], which is a way of making the expression stronger, or ""is trivial in comparison with"".

I actually just found out vampiric was a word, but I want something that sounds better (more colloquial/natural, I suppose) and covers a variety of traits (pale, emaciated, sickly, etc). Why I don't just use ""vampiric"": As @chepner commented: I think the idea is to find a word that isn't so ""circular"", and doesn't refer explicitly to vampires or require knowledge of vampires in context. If someone were to ask ""What does a vampire look like?"", then ""It looks vampiric/vampirish"" wouldn't be terribly helpful. I don't want to explicitly refer to drug addicts as vampires. I just want to capture those traits in the best way. 
Answer: For something often used to describe people and not an analogy like ghoulish or vampiric or cadaverous: pallid - very pale, in a way that looks unhealthy and not attractive.

"input: Question: Does ""egoistic"" and ""egotistic"" mean the same thing? 
Answer: No. While similar, they have some important differences. Consider this note on usage from the Oxford Dictionaries: The words egoism and egotism are frequently confused, as though interchangeable, but there are distinctions worth noting. Both words derive from Latin ego ('I'), the first-person singular pronoun. Egotism, the more commonly used term , denotes an excessive sense of self-importance, too-frequent use of the word 'I,' and general arrogance and boastfulness. Egoism, a more subtle term , is perhaps best left to ethicists, for whom it denotes a view or theory of moral behavior in which self-interest is the root of moral conduct. An egoist, then , might devote considerable attention to introspection, but could be modest about it, whereas an egotist would have an exaggerated sense of the importance of his or her self-analysis, and would have to tell everyone.

"input: Question: I understand what the idiom means: as per this question, it means a person or creature unwittingly used as a test for danger, often destructively. I understand why coalmines: as depositories of ancient organic waste, they are particularly prone to methane and carbon monoxide buildup. But why a canary? They are technically exotic, native and (at least originally) endemic to the sub-tropical Canary Islands, which gave them their name. They were also renowned for their singing voice, as found out in this answer, and could presumably be quite expensive. So why would a mining company in Britain and/or America and/or any other English speaking country use such an expensive and exotic bird as a glorified carbon monoxide detector whose sole purpose in life was to suffocate to death? Why wouldn't they use sparrows, or starlings, or some other small songbird native to the area? Are canaries just that easy to breed and keep? Are they super-extra-sensitive to poison gases and thus were the ""upscale"" model? Were all small, caged songbirds called ""canaries"" as a matter of course? Or did the modern idiom simply opt for alliteration over historical accuracy? 
Answer: Male canaries will sing all the time when they're alone in the hope of their song attracting a female. In fact, the main reason for them being held in captivity is their incessant song. This makes them ideal for coal mines; you don't have to concentrate on them or watch them. You do your work, register the canary's song as a background noise, and as soon as the background noise stops, you know you're in trouble.

"input: Question: Is there a word or term for the state of a human or animal infested with ticks? Mainly just curious. Examples: He's suffering from ______. Don't get near him: he has _____. 
Answer: If you are looking for an informal way of saying it, you pretty much have the most natural way already: ""he is tick-infested"" or ""he is infested with ticks"". Saying ""He has ..."" is asking for a formal medical condition, like diabetes. The most informal of this would be ""He has a problem with ticks"" or ""He has a lot of ticks"".

"input: Question: I've heard this joke several times, but I'm ashamed to say I really cannot understand it. It just doesn't seem to make any sense however I look at it. I have a suspicion that it is supposed to be rude, so I'd like to offer my apologies if it causes offence- that is not my intension. Here's the joke: Two nuns are in the bath. Nun1: Where's the soap? Nun2: Yes, it does rather. Edit: I understand the pun on ""where's""/""wears"". But what I don't understand is why that is funny. Several people have mentioned that there is a sexual inference, but I don't understand where it comes from. 
Answer: Rudeness to Follow: The first nun cannot find the soap because the second nun is masturbating with it. The humour in the joke, such as it is, flows from profaning the sacred by sexualizing nuns who have taken vows of chastity. This is obviously a vulgar form of humour.

How would the word obsolete be applied as a verb? obsoleted The automobile obsoleted the horse and buggy. bleech. made obsolete The automobile made obsolete the horse and buggy. Not bad, but there's room for improvement. EDIT: I'm looking for a verb that has an edge; that captures the upheaval and aggressiveness involved in displacing a product or industry. Killed is a bit strong. killed The automobile killed the horse and buggy. A bit overstated. ran out of business The automobile ran the horse and buggy out of business marginally better, but still not good. disrupted the automobile disrupted the horse and buggy Better applied to an industry, like so the automobile disrupted the transportation industry in the early 20th century; particularly the horse and buggy. Wordy. smashed The automobile smashed the horse and buggy. More along the lines of what I seek, but a bit improper. XXX The automobile XXX the horse and buggy. What verb fits best here?

Anyway, it just got me onto thinking that it's not anthropomorphy if I want to give a non-human (animal) trait to an inanimate object. Another example is that the comedian Isy Suttie once described an elderly person, hunched over and using a pair of walking sticks as resembling an insect (except she was funny).

"input: Question: What is the idiom for a situation that ""If people-in-authority don't follow their own set rules, then what can one expect from rest of us"" in similar examples given below in different settings: When HR themselves are tardy, undisciplined then what can you expect from the employees (punctuality and discipline)? When traffic police themselves are offending (driving without belts, smoking while driving) what can you expect from the vehicle driving community in the city? When parents themselves are undisciplined (smoking in front of children), what can you expect from the children themselves? When the management is insincere, what can you expect from their staff? 
Answer: The more colloquial idiom would be ""Sauce for the Goose, is sauce for the Gander"" That is, rules that apply to those under authority must also apply to those in authority. Or, rules that apply to me must also apply to you. All the other phrases are correct as well. A common idea with many expressions. Another expression of this from US Colonial times: ""The Law condemns the man or woman Who steals the goose from off the Common But lets the greater villain loose, Who steals the Common from the goose."".

"input: Question: As generally agreed and as extensively discussed in this question, ""an"" should be used in place of the more common ""a"" where the following word begins with a vowel sound. I have just encountered for the first time an instance of the phrasing an mule in the book Why Chemical Reactions Happen (James Keeler and Peter Wothers, Oxford University Press, 2003). (This book is not mine. I was sitting opposite a friend when the friend mentioned the unusual phrasing.) This phrasing appears to contradict the rule discussed above, since ""mule"" is, as far as I am aware, pronounced /mjul/ (see Wiktionary). Here is the context. The author is using an analogy to explain a chemistry concept (the italics are not mine, but the bold emphasis is): A useful analogy here is that of an mule, which we get by crossing a horse with a donkey. To describe an mule as a horse or a donkey would be inaccurate and it certainly does not interconvert rapidly between the two! Rather we need to recognize that although an mule has parts that are reminiscent of a horse and parts that a reminiscent of a donkey, it is something altogether different. Looking for other examples online, I have managed to find one on Wikipedia's List of Siege engines. Discussing a Siege engine, the Scorpio: Similar to the ballista, but smaller. Was sometimes mounted on an mule-drawn cart. Other examples are difficult to find, but here's one from a user-posted question on Answers.com (referring, notably, to a kind of deer rather than the animal, a mule): Is an mule deer an omnivore? No. Mule deer are herbivores. ... What is going on? Is there an irregular pronunication of ""mule"" of which I am not aware? Is this some strange language quirk, some archaic spelling that I am encountering for the first time? 
Answer: The original printing had ""an ass"" instead of ""an mule"". That error was not lost on the chemistry community. See, for instance, Krenos's 2004 review of the text in the Journal of Chemical Education: In Chapter 10, bonding in extended conjugated systems and resonance are introduced with the horse + donkey = ass analogy (it is likely the hybrid animal mule is intended instead of ass, however). It seems the editors subsequently made an error mistake.

"input: Question: Just to clarify, I'm not talking about the Lush product of the same name. In Australia, the washing up fairy is a mythical creature. People leave their dishes unwashed overnight, and lo and behold, the next morning the dishes are clean thanks to the washing up fairy. Sadly, she (I assume it's a she) is more often noted in her absence than her presence. As in ""The washing up fairy didn't come, I'll have to do the dishes now."" An example of her being mentioned: Her theory is simple we must replace the behaviours we don't want with those we do. For example, leaving dirty dishes on the kitchen bench for the washing-up fairy to tidy should be replaced with loading the dirty dishes in the dishwasher. Her existence has been documented neither by Wiktionary nor Urban Dictionary. Is her distribution limited to Australia, and presumably New Zealand, plus the households of those who have moved from these countries? 
Answer: I'm in the U.S., and I've never heard of the Washing-Up Fairy. Still, using a fairy to explain an unexplained yet serendipitous discovery is not unheard of. When I Googled ""a fairy came and cleaned"", I found: my mother would call me the next day, ""Oh! a Fairy came and cleaned the house"" [in a Yahoo! answer] ""Let's pretend a fairy came and cleaned up your room."" [from a parenting book] Every morning, it's as if a fairy came and cleaned the house for me. [from a Roomba vacuum review on amazon.com] Miraculously, when I came downstairs I found that a fairy came and cleaned up the party mess inside (thank you Daddy!) [from a 2004 blog] So, such ""pay-it-forward"" cleaning acts of kindness are often attributed to fairy folk. I never realized until today, though, that the Tooth Fairy had a cousin called the Washing Up Fairy, at least by those Down Under.

"input: Question: The first time I encountered the word ""gondola"" was as a 20 year old on her first visit to Venice. Gondolas, to me, were written in my memory as a flat, fancy, romantic (and expensive to ride) boat structures that traverse the canals of Venice, Italy. But soon thereafter, on my first visit to Banff, Canada (Canadian Rockies) -- Gondolas was also the term for ski-like lifts (enclosed from the elements) to get from the bottom to the top of steep mountains (vice versa). What is the etymology of ""gondola""? And how did it develop to reference two completely different transportation devices? One on water, the other on mountains? What is the relationship besides their obvious transportation connect? 
Answer: Some of the successive meanings given in the OED are: 1a. "" A light flat-bottomed boat or skiff in use on the Venetian canals, having a cabin amidships and rising to a sharp point at either end; it is usually propelled by one man at the stern with a single oar."" U.S. A large flat-bottomed river boat of light build; a lighter; used also as a gun-boat. 4a. ""= gondola-car n. U.S."", which is glossed as ""U.S. a railway car having a platform body with low sides."" 4b. ""An elongated car attached to the under side of a dirigible balloon or airship. [German, Dutch gondel.] Also transf., applied to a structure that resembles such a car in its purpose and mode of attachment."" 4c. ""The car attached to a ski-lift. Also gondola lift."" So the crucial step appears to be the cabin of an airship (which is long and low), and then a cabin suspended from something. This kind of semantic drift is very common.

"input: Question: Is there a specific reason for this? After all, it is ""boys and girls"", rather than ""girls and boys"". If the boy (male) comes first here, why doesn't it come first in ""ladies and gentlemen""? 
Answer: It probably has to do with the phonetic and metrical properties of ""ladies and gentlemen"" versus ""gentlemen and ladies."" Say them both out loud and see which one sounds better to you, intuitively. The metrical pattern of ""ladies and gentlemen"" consists of (arguably) two dactyls. A dactyl is a group of three syllables where the first is stressed and the second two are unstressed. When these occur in succession, they are pleasant to the ear. ladies and gentlemen DUM da da / DUM da da The metrical pattern of ""gentlemen and ladies"" falls into a much less regular pattern. It is less pleasant to the ear. It is something like a stressed syllable followed by three unstressed syllables followed by a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable. gentlemen and ladies DUM da da da DUM da Our language tends to organize itself according to regular and pleasant stress patterns. My guess is that is why we feel more drawn to ""ladies and gentlemen"" than ""gentlemen and ladies"" and why the former has conventionalized.

"input: Question: Are there any differences between ""oval"" and ""ellipse""? 
Answer: To me the defining difference is this: An oval can be made from two radiuses. That is, you can make an oval using your compass (or parts of a circle, if you like). You can never do this with an ellipse. That is, no part of an ellipse will ever make a circle.

"input: Question: I wrote this sentence: Why wouldn't it be valid? --and I realized that without the contraction it becomes: Why would it not be valid? As opposed to ""why would not it be valid,"" as the contraction would imply. What's going on here? Why can I contract across the middle word this way? Or, to put it the other way, why can't I ""de-contract"" this without moving the not over by a word? 
Answer: It reflects an older sentence structure of English which is no longer used. You placed the negative immediately after the verb it was negating ('not' placed after 'would'). This structure was used when the contraction first developed. That placement of the negative has changed but is preserved in the contraction.

"input: Question: I sometimes see the term ""critical but stable"" in the news. It is often used to describe someone who has been very seriously injured. For example (15 December 2019): ""[A police officer] said the man who had been shot was in a ""critical but stable "" condition in hospital."" I understand that ""critically ill"" means that life is in danger. Similarly ""stable"" is the opposite. Quotes from www.lexico.com critically To an extreme degree with a risk of death. 'two critically wounded people died in hospital'. 'critically ill patients who were awaiting surgery' stable (of a patient or their medical condition) not deteriorating in health after an injury or operation.

"input: Question: For example, a computer security expert can be an expert and making a basic mistake, perhaps unrelated to his personality but highly relevant to his field of expertise and a mistake that just about anybody could do but just because he is a security expert he especially should not have done it. I don't mean stupid mistake or stupid error but I mean contradictory and almost similar to a double-standard. Jeff teaches English but he couldn't spell ""occurrence"". Or for example George is a professional Microsoft Windows programmer but he doesn't know what alt+tab does. Or Henry is a surgeon but he cut himself shaving. I don't necessarily mean something like a police officer who himself is corrupt or a judge who is corrupt because those are not accidents or mistakes but deliberate. Albert Einstein was a genius but couldn't remember his own address and entered the wrong house when going home. (Perhaps the above Einstein example is not a great example because scientist could be absent-minded.) I mean more like actually mistakenly missing the basics of your own speciality or making a human error that anybody else could do except you because you are supposed to be the specialist. I think the classic example could be Bill Gates trying to show how good Microsoft Windows is and it crashes. Or a news anchor, who should be a specialist in not making a word mistake, actually makes a word mistake. Or a judge or an attorney, who should be experts in law and rights, wouldn't know something trivial about law and right e.g. unknowingly about that blackmailing is a crime. I almost made such a mistake myself. I was an IT specialist and computer technician at a client's office and their boss was teaching himself the basics of programming and asking me about something basic. I actually got it right but I was not completely certain about something basic while actually being able to solve complicated and advanced problems for them. 
Answer: Not a single word, but one could call this a rookie mistake. An example is ""Trump's Trade Chief Makes a Rookie Mistake"". The Cato Institute's Dan Ikenson recently took Navarro to task for his views on trade. Ikenson says Navarro is making an elementary error when he writes: When net exports are negative, that is, when a country runs a trade deficit by importing more than it exports, this subtracts from growth.

Answer: In this case, neither is acting as an adverb. So yes, this is correct. Try using an alternate adverb, aboard. We are aboard. That works. It might sound more 'correct' but only because we think adverb first with aboard and one might think determiner first with neither. To be clear: it isn't idiomatic, an ungrammatical construction we've just gotten used to. It's straight up correct.

According to Jurassic wiki, Tyrannosaurus rex, the most famous of all dinosaurs species and commonly known as T. rex, was the largest of the Tyrannosaur family and by extension one of the largest theropods, reaching 12 to 13 meters in length. But what does 'If she's a feminist, then I'm a T. Rex' mean? Does the writer sarcastically admit herself being anachronistic? Why should it be a T.Rex, not other monsterous or supernatural creatures, say, Moby-Dick and Godzilla? Is this a cute turn of phrase? Could you translate ""I'm a T.rex"" into plain English?

Answer: Though the word personal is repeated in the expansion ""personal personal computer"", the two repetitions use different meanings of the same word. The first personal means ""owned or used by a specific single person"" (definition 1 here), while the second indicates ""designed to be used by a single person"" (definition 2 here, again). Both instances are required to convey the full idea and thus are not redundant. Consider the following examples spelled out in full: Personal PC: personal personal computer, (the usual case of a personal computer owned by a person) personal mainframe computer (I have a Cray in my bedroom), Public PC: public personal computer (a PC that is installed in a kiosk usable by anybody).

"input: Question: Is there a word or phrase which describes ""choice of misleading words"", or the negation: ""choice of non-misleading words""? The nearest phrases I can think of are linguistic deception, or controlled language, as in Nineteen Eighty-Four. For example, Richard Stallman actively opposes such misuse of language: I think it is ok for authors (please let's not call them creators, they are not gods) to ask for money for copies of their works (please let's not devalue these works by calling them content) in order to gain income (the term compensation falsely implies it is a matter of making up for some kind of damages). Another example is ""credit"" in banking, which just makes ""debt"" sound like a good thing. EDIT: The term may either refer to an individual's malicious use of misleading terminology, or to widely-accepted use of misleading terminology. The answers reflect this, but my question does not. 
Answer: George Orwell, in his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, used the terms doublethink (the act of simultaneously accepting two mutually contradictory beliefs as correct) and Newspeak (a controlled language of restricted grammar and limited vocabulary, meant to limit the freedom of thought). These two have been combined to form the term doublespeak (frequently incorrectly attributed to Orwell's 1984) meaning ""language that deliberately obscures, disguises, distorts, or reverses the meaning of words.""

Most commonly English speakers butcher it however they like, so no, there is not one correct way to fail to pronounce the French word. It's a potayto-potahtoh thing.

"input: Question: Possible Duplicate: What is the difference between an expression and a phrase? Difference between ""phrase"" and ""idiom"" What is the difference between a phrase, an idiom and an expression? I am looking for the context where one is more appropriate than the rest. I've been using idiom and phrase more or less interchangeably. 
Answer: This question asks nearly the same thing. This is the difference between an idiom and a phrase: A phrase is ""a small group of words standing together as a conceptual unit"", while an idiom is ""a group of words established by usage as having a meaning not deducible from those of the individual words"". So, the difference is that an idiom as an established meaning not directly linked to the individual words. Any idiom is a phrase. As an example, ""raining cats and dogs"" is both an idiom and a phrase. ""A herd of cats"" is a phrase but not an idiom. Expression has about the same meaning as phrase, except it is usually used of a phrase which is in common use. So an idiom is a certain sort of expression, which in turn is a subset of phrase: idiom > expression > phrase.

"input: Question: The context: Customer pays for some service 100$. If he chooses an option X, we charge him 20$ more, so 120$ in total. As a programmer I want my variables to have meaningful names. How would you call this 20$ in this context? I consider two words: markup (but it is more related to the business than customer IMHO) and surcharge. 
Answer: I would think that what ever is driving the cost/price of the ""Extra"" should be kept as its own identity. If we choose an extra option on the back of a product, like cable mentioned above, we know what we are asking for and therefore we are not being charged anything additional. The cable company would report separately on these two items, as they should. So, that said, where will you report this income? As a product sale, a service offered, or are you simply wanting to charge one person more than another for the same product/service?.

"input: Question: The US emergency telephone number 911 seems to be almost always pronounced as nine one one whereas the Porsche model is typically pronounced as nine eleven One reason I can think of for preferring ""nine one one"" for the phone number is that there is no ""eleven"" key on a phone. On the other hand, ""0800"" is often pronounced ""o eight hundred"". Is there a logical or historical reason for the different pronunciations? 
Answer: That the emergency number 911 is pronounced nine-one-one is probably a standard to avoid confusion or doubt by either children or non-natives to the English language. Pronouncing the number as nine hundred and eleven could be misinterpreted as 90011, hence the emphasis of three digits. This is also a deal in most European countries, where 112 is the emergency number and pronounced 1-1-2 in the languages I know and for all I know in other languages too. one-one-two (English), ein-eins-zwei (German), et-et-to (Danish), einn-einn-tveir (Icelandic).

Answer: The correct answer is socket per the TCP/IP specification (RFC 793). To allow for many processes within a single Host to use TCP communication facilities simultaneously, the TCP provides a set of addresses or ports within each host. Concatenated with the network and host addresses from the internet communication layer, this forms a socket.

It seems quite redundant: I need five (5) kumquats, stat! (Though it isn't always in a legal context, might it be related to this answer on this question?) 
Answer: The redundancy is presumably intended to reduce typos, forgery, and other types of error or manipulation in order to make the intent as clear as possible. It is known professionally as a CYA. It's obvious what my intent is when I rather carelessly write an I.O.U. for sevum kumquats, but alas, sevum is not really a word and opens up our contract to litigation. Adding the numeral 7 in parenthesis after sevum clarifies the intent. Similarly, if I were to write an I.O.U. for 3 kumquats, one could easily change that 3 to an 8, but it is far more difficult to make three look like eight. The practice appears to be a legal tradition rather than a universally honored rule. If you've ever written a check (known as a cheque to the Queen), you've written out a number with words and followed it with a numeral (albeit without parenthesis).

"input: Question: Should e.g. and i.e. have periods, e.g. ""e.g."", or no periods, eg ""eg""? Should they be italicized, e.g. ""i.e."" or not, eg ""i.e""? 
Answer: In formal contexts, I would go with ""e.g."" and ""i.e."", with two periods and without a whitespace. The spellings without periods are quite popular, but informal. For example, Merriam-Webster does not have an entry for either ""eg"" or ""ie"". Wiktionary marks ""eg."" and ""eg"" as informal, and offers the following usage notes: Opinion is mixed about whether this term should be italicized as although it is Latin, it has become part of standard English, and whether it should be written with a separating space ""e. g."" as it was originally two separate words. It also offers the following usage notes for ""i.e."": Opinion is mixed about whether the abbreviation should be italicized, or whether there should be a separating non-breaking space as in i. e.. ie is often found in current usage, and is perhaps now considered acceptable. Personally, I would argue that there's no need whatsoever to italicize ""e.g."" or ""i.e."". Both expressions are extremely common in English, and have been for a long time. They are full-fledged citizens of the English language, and as such, they do not have to be italicized as if they were foreign words.

"input: Question: As per title of the question, I see this a lot. ""We will release the product when issue 51 has been finalized."" ""We are waiting for it to be finalized."" Is this just a case of people trying to sound professional with corporate jargon , or is there a real difference between 'finish' and 'finalize'? 
Answer: The definitions of finalise and finish are pretty similar, with finalise referring to the production of, or agreement on, the finished version. The single word finalise carries the connotation of just the last bit, whereas finish needs helper words to carry that connotation (e.g. finish off, finish up). Saying that something is finished can also carry the unwanted sense that it is done for, that is, that it is of no further use; finalise doesn't carry that unwanted sense. In commerce (including the fields of software engineering and management that you specifically referenced), completion isn't always enough. The customer wants confirmation of completion. Transacting parties want the signed agreement that follows the completion of negotiations, or the invoicing and payment that follow the completion of work. So it isn't enough that the work is finished (even in the positive sense); it needs to be finalised.

However, if I say ""this car is damn expensive"" then I better convey the connotation of ""expensive"".

For example, ""damn expensive"" could be ok but is there any other term? 
Answer: stiff v. Usually applied to describe ""to fail or refuse to tip a server,"" to stiff also means more generally ""to cheat someone out of money."" e.g. You said your brother-in-law would give me a fair deal, so I was surprised that he would stiff me out of so much money.

"input: Question: Possible Duplicate: When to drop the 'e' when ending in -able? Both are correct for these words: sizable, sizeable sharable, shareable takable, takeable But these words are incorrect: storeable (storable) makeable (makable) tasteable (tastable) minglable (mingleable) acknowledgable (acknowledgeable) managable (manageable) Are there rules for this? The case for keeping the ""e"" seems to be that the ""ga"" in ""acknowledgable"" would be read as ""gall"" rather than ""germ"", but ""minglable"" shouldn't cause that problem. I'm also not sure why we couldn't keep the ""e"" in words like ""storable"" or ""makable"". 
Answer: The general rule is that you drop the e, provided that it's actually a silent one rather than forming part of an ee digraph as with agreeable, decreeable, disagreeable, foreseeable, and seeable. You only otherwise have to keep a final silent e when adding able if it would (1) either change the pronunciation, or (2) it would cause a collision with an existing word that already means something else altogether different. The first case, pronunciation shift, is for things like raceable or purgeable, where losing the e would make the ce or ge switch from the ""soft"" version to the ""hard"" version due to the resulting g or c now being followed by an a rather than by an e, and cable and gable are pronounced quite differently. The second case, a collision with an existing word, occurs with such pairs as pareable / parable, placeable / placable, probeable / probable, and spareable / sparable. Notice how placeable also has the first factor in play, as too would singeable / singable. Beyond that, there is some slight variation in acceptable forms, such as both microwaveable / microwavable being attested. Normally however, you lose the e. The OED2 attests 1555 words than end in able but not in eable, while only 123 that do actually end in eable. That's a ratio of nearly 13 to 1 in favor of more able words without a preceding e. Not excluding duplicates with alternate spellings, here are the eable words from the OED2 plus quarterly supplements since 2000: acknowledgeable decreeable haveable mingleable salvageable acreable defaceable hireable mortgageable scribbleable activeable delineable holeable nameable seeable adduceable derangeable hopeable negligeable serviceable advanceable disagreeable imageable noticeable shakeable agreeable dischargeable immalleable packageable shapeable allegeable discourageable impermeable pareable shareable arrangeable displaceable inassuageable passageable sizeable balanceable divorceable indulgeable peaceable skateable batheable dyeable ineffaceable permeable sliceable biteable effaceable influenceable pierceable spareable blameable embraceable interchangeable placeable stageable bounceable enforceable irremeable pledgeable strangleable bridgeable exchangeable irreplaceable policeable swindleable carriageable experienceable irretraceable poseable takeable challengeable eyeable judgeable probeable tallageable chanceable fleeceable knowledgeable pronounceable tameable changeable foreseeable likeable purgeable tasteable chargeable forgeable liveable raceable throttleable chaseable garbleable lodgeable rateable traceable chooseable gaugeable malleable reable vengeable commenceable giveable manageable rebukeable voyageable cuddleable gorgeable marriageable replaceable whistleable damageable grazeable microwaveable ropeable danceable hateable mineable saleable As you see, there is also some tendancy to preserve the final e if in the original it's there to make a so-called ""long"" vowel long. However, this doesn't happen consistently enough to make a rule for them. However, for those cases there are a lot of alternate ""sans""-e forms for those, like ropeable / ropable. Perhaps a more interesting question and certainly one with a more complicated answer is how to know which words instead take ible forms. There are 275 of these in the OED2, more than twice as many as eable words. There are actual rules there, although they are a bit complicated for some people. That one I'll leave for when it actually gets asked. :).

"input: Question: I am watching a UK TV programme called ""The Apprentice"". The candidates have to sell guided tours. Some candidates are terrible at giving these tours. They fluff their lines, or they haven't researched, or they make up ""facts"". Watching their ineptitude cause a feeling of discomfort. What is the best word for this discomfort? The German word schadenfreude means roughly ""the pleasure derived from the misfortunes of others"". The word I want would be almost an antonym of schadenfreude - ""the discomfort derived from the mosfortunes of others"". Except not the misfortunes but the uselessness of others. 
Answer: As far as I can imagine, there isn't such a word in the English language, but there are a few words that could be made to fit with that idea. Empathize means sympathizing with another person's unfortunate circumstances. Though empathizing with a person doesn't exactly have to do with that person's ineptitude, you can elaborate on the idea easily enough to make it clear. Empathize means to put yourself in another person's shoes or to feel as another person feels. Pity is another word that is commonly understood but also commonly forgotten. Unfortunately the word pity in modern times has taken on a sort of high and mighty tone that discourages its use, but it means almost exactly what you're trying to express: pity for the person for the embarrassment he or she has brought upon him- or herself. I'm quite positive there are others, but I have a migraine. :) Hope these help!.

"input: Question: In math, we use the term series a lot, and there are many types of series. How should I craft my sentence when I have three different ones in mind to talk about? Should I settle down for a less mortal alternative of ""list of series"" or something like that? The existing question on The possessive and plural forms of ""series"" suggests the usage of series'. But is that all? If that's the only solution, then could you please explain the usage of apostrophe symbol at the end? Is that a plural marker or a possessive marker, or both? 
Answer: Series (like deer, salmon, and sheep) is pronounced and spelled the same in the plural as in the singular. If either the singular or the plural is used as a possessive, an apostrophe is added to show that in print, though there is no pronunciation difference in speech. Thus, The series doesn't converge. (singular) The series don't converge. (plural) This series' limit is unknown. (singular possessive) These series' limits are unknown. (plural possessive) More examples can be seen here.

"input: Question: When to use a or an before a noun when there are adjectives before that noun? like the following example: An operator pressed the button. should that make: A professional operator pressed the button. An professional operator pressed the button. same for: A Hypertext markup language. An Hypertext markup language. Sometimes it seems a bit confusing, especially when there are more adjectives like: An omen was revealed to the priest. A terrible omen was revealed to the priest. An overwhelming terrible omen was revealed to the priest. What is the rule? 
Answer: The article changes based on the word immediately following, not necessarily on the noun. There is no difference in meaning between ""a"" and ""an"" - the distinction is used to preserve an alternation between vowels and consonants when the sentence is spoken aloud. Be aware that speakers of American and British English observe different rules (mainly because we can't agree on whether to pronounce the letter H or not!) In your example: A Hypertext Markup language. An Hypertext markup language. an American speaker (and, to be honest, most British speakers) would find the first one correct, while an exaggerated aitch-dropper would use the second.

"input: Question: If you look at this gif of a drone replacing a lightbulb, you'll understand what concept I'm trying to find a word for. Using dynamite for fishing would be another example. I'm looking for a word that describes the use of high-tech equipment, for a purpose that is normally filled by low-tech equipment, usually done out of laziness or amusement. This is specifically relating to technology (overengineering is very close). 
Answer: One possible term is Overengineering. Overengineering (or over-engineering) is the designing of a product to be more robust or complicated than is necessary for its application....In one form, products are overbuilt, and have performance far in excess of needs (a family sedan that can drive at 300 km/h, or a home video cassette recorder with a projected lifespan of 100 years)....Alternatively, they may be overcomplicated the design may be far more complicated than is necessary for its use, such as a modern text editor asking whether files should be saved in ASCII, EBCDIC or various multi-byte formats.... Source: Wikipedia. Using a drone to replace a light bulb is certainly ""far more complicated than is necessary"", and a drone that is purchased for the purpose of being a light bulb changer would be especially well described by that phrase. Kerievsky (2002), speaking specifically about software engineering but in a way applicable to robotics, writes that overengineering happens when one engineers ""in anticipation of needs that never materialize"". Source: Joshua Kerievsky, April 01, 2002, Stop Over-Engineering!, Dr. Dobb's Journal. A drone-based light bulb changing system could be envisioned as becoming practically useful later if a need arises to change light bulbs located in inconventiently high or inaccessible locations (such as the roof of a stadium, or on the outside of a very tall flagpole), but the majority of people do not encounter such situations frequently, if at all.

"input: Question: There was the following passage in New York Times' (October 6) article commenting on GOP Presidential candidate, Carly Fiorina under the headline, 'If she's a feminist, then I'm a T. Rex': ""Her record at Hewlett-Packard firing skilled Americans by the thousands and outsourcing their jobs to China and India, while almost running her company into the ground with an ill-advised merger is hardly a sterling record for any sort of candidate, assuming we actually want a president of all the people rather than a modern Ebenezer Scrooge, - - This is a woman who would deny other women control over their own bodies, as well. ""If she's a feminist then I'm a T. rex."" According to Jurassic wiki, Tyrannosaurus rex, the most famous of all dinosaurs species and commonly known as T. rex, was the largest of the Tyrannosaur family and by extension one of the largest theropods, reaching 12 to 13 meters in length. But what does 'If she's a feminist, then I'm a T. Rex' mean? Does the writer sarcastically admit herself being anachronistic? Why should it be a T.Rex, not other monsterous or supernatural creatures, say, Moby-Dick and Godzilla? Is this a cute turn of phrase? Could you translate ""I'm a T.rex"" into plain English? 
Answer: Carly Fiorina is being attacked by feminists for her pretty negative comment on Planned Parenthood as she insisted at the CNN GOP primary debate that this organization is cruelly killing unborn babies to sell their organs for research. A vidoe footage on which she based her claim was found doctored by fact-checkers. Some Republican governors defunded Planned Parenthood in their states and they are fighting hard to defund it at a national level. This is what makes Carly Fiorina an anti-feminist and the author is using metaphor with the least possible thing that anyone can be if she is a feminist. REX of T-rex means a King and what a better metaphor to attack her who wants to be POTUS (President of the United States).

"input: Question: This question, ""Discrete Units of a Continuous Quantity"", asks whether units of a continuous quantity should be spoken of as discrete or continuous. The top answer states The rule is simple, and you obviously know it: discrete quantities require the use of ""fewer"" and continuous quantities require the use of ""less"". Calorie, as a unit, requires the use of ""fewer"". Energy, as a continuum, requires the use of ""less"". ""Fewer calories means less energy."" I do not understand the logic here though. Calorie is a unit, yes, but it is a continuous unit (it is possible to have half a calorie, or 4.582394 calories). Since a calorie is such a small unit of energy compared to what it is usually used for (food energy and human metabolism), it is very seldom expressed in a fractional form and instead is rounded (usually to the nearest 10 or higher). Why then should ""fewer"" be used with calorie instead of ""less""? Is there another relevant rule than just ""continuous quantities use ""less"" and discrete quantities use ""fewer""? 
Answer: We simply don't speak of 5 Energy. The key difference here, mathematically, is rationals vs real numbers. That is, even if you cut your kilocalories in half, you would always have a finite-length number to describe the amount. Hence, the rationals as well as the natural numbers are called countable. The set of Real Numbers on the other hand is an uncountable set, because for every finite-length number, you can have an infinite amount of infinite-length real numbers that start with the finite length number. The details are tricky, I'm not a maths teacher. So far so good. Why then is energy uncountable? It's a historically grown thing. The whys and hows of this fact should be part of a different question, though. (I mean, I really don't know). Suffice to say that the distinction between the measured object and the measurement result is purposeful.

"input: Question: Does English use the word thou in situations nowadays? For example, to humiliate an opponent by being overly familiar? 
Answer: In a very specific technical usage, yes. ""thou"" is a jargon abbreviation for ""one thousandth of an inch"" and crops up in machining. Also, automotive industry has to measure fine tolerances, so older petrol engines may have their spark plug gaps measured in inches and be stated as ""50 thou"" or similar, and pistons may have tolerances in thou. Any workshop engineer using lathes and fitting parts together closely would be familiar with this term even in metric countries. Modern CNC workshops are much more likely to work in metric. The exception would be Americans who end up working in both measurement systems. Aside, in this context ""tenth"" means ""tenth of a thousandth of an inch"" and not ""tenth of an inch"" It is never said as ""ten-thousandth of an inch"" because that could be misheard for ""ten x thousandths of an inch"" (ie a hundredth of an inch) in a noisy machine workshop.

The biggest rise was from 1980 until now: 0.000002%-0.0000053%. From what I can tell from the books in which this appears, the most recent are technical writing by non-native-speakers of English. A couple from the 19th century are legitimate English: the assembly may compel the observance of a proper decorum by all persons, whom it allows to be present at its proceedings. and It assembles more frequently, and at its own time, without any control from the king ; and it allows to him only a ... Jim's example, It allows to pass certain particles while trapping others, is certainly, as he says, unwieldy because it's not parallel: It allows to pass certain particles and {allows not / disallows} others. which is a style monster regardless of the parallel construction. It should be: It allows certain particles to pass {while trapping / but traps / but disallows} others. The syntax is so bad in that sentence that, however grammatically valid it is, Fowler would retch after reading it. Merely thinking it up would violate the admonition against secret sin in the Sermon on the Mount, and actually writing it for public consumption would cause the reader as much pain as would driving a wooden stake through the heart of the sleeping Dracula cause the vampire. Your conclusion that ""'it allows the application of ...' or 'it allows one to apply ...' sound much better"" is absolutely correct. That's what language is about in part: what it sounds like.

Answer: Both timeslot and time slot are acceptable. You will find an equal amount of dictionaries containing either.

Group Punishment is simply punishing a large group of people. Is there a specific word for when a large group is punished because of the actions of the few? Such as in the following: Little Jimmy wasn't happy when the entire class was forced to work through recess because of 3 kids getting into a fight yesterday. 
Answer: Though probably not as a good a choice as collective punishment, the word intimidation could also work in some cases. Groups of people are commonly punished in order to intimidate the majority.

"input: Question: When someone says I stand corrected. What does that mean? 
Answer: It means ""I admit that I was wrong"". See e.g. Cambridge Dictionaries: used to admit that something you have said or done was wrong I stand corrected - the date of foundation was 1411, and not 1412 as I had written. Or Wiktionary: Said to acknowledge someone who corrects something that one says or writes that was not correct. The Battle of Hastings was fought in 1056. No it wasn't! Look in the textbook! Oh, sorry. I stand corrected - it was fought in 1066. Note that the Cambridge Dictionary marks this idiom as ""formal"", and Merriam-Webster's Learner's Dictionary as ""somewhat formal"".

"input: Question: My company is developing smart eyewear and I'm looking for a short word to describe the users of our smartglasses for English documents. The ideal wording would be understandable by British, US, and international audiences. It's primarily intended for internal usage, product specification, and exchanges with partners. It doesn't need to be formal; it can be some mild slang instead as long as it's generally friendly. We want to be able to use it openly in user documentation. It can't simply be 'users', because we also have other kinds of 'users' of our products who won't necessarily be using the smartglasses. So far I like the sound of 'speckies' or 'speccies' found in online dictionaries. Do they sound appropriate to you or would you have anything else to suggest? 
Answer: You could use myope. Obviously not everyone wearing glasses has myopia, but if you're just after a shorthand, this could suffice: A short-sighted person. -- Oxford Dictionaries.

"input: Question: If you, for example, have to add a person to an application whilst that person is on the phone, how do you politely ask for that person's gender if the voice and/or name has not proven decisive? To clarify why I posted this question on this site: I was looking for an answer within the context of the English language and usage. The given answers have proven that this question really isn't off-topic, other languages know different distinctions that are relevant to addressing this issue. 
Answer: I totally agree that this is not really about English language usage but here's a suggestion anyway...preface the question with an apology, ""I'm sorry, but I'm required to ask this question, even if it seems obvious, may I have your gender please?"".
output: ",yes
"input: Question: Sometimes people are referring to mechanical objects as ""she"": I love my car. She always gets the best service. Are there any rules when it is appropriate to use ""she"" instead of it, and is ""he"" ever used in such context? 
Answer: The reason why cars and alike are called ""She"" is because ships are made from Female oak, being that the wood is much stronger than the male oak... This I was told by a ship builder many years ago... Basically anything Mechanical is now referred to as ""She"".

"input: Question: What is the meaning of wrt in the following text? I think this is an excellent idea, but I'd like to see this explicitly reframed under the banner of providing Drupal.org data through publicly-accessible APIs. We started kicking off at least one discussion like that wrt Git over, which also led back to ""#112805: XML-RPC Interface"". 
Answer: WRT is an abbreviation that stands for with respect to or with regard to.

"input: Question: I've read this and this. I know that the underlying question has been answered, my problem is of a different nature: I'm currently writing my master's thesis in CS and my professor thinks that the apostrophe possessive is only applicable to people. He claims to have spoken to a linguist from Cambridge who confirmed his opinion. Neither my professor nor I am a native speaker and the thesis is being written in Germany. Now, I know that he won't care if I just send him a couple of links to the answers here. So my question is: How do I convince my professor? Are there any ""more scientific™"" sources that I can point to? Examples of phrases: If each plant's humidity is displayed publicly [...] [...] shows an overview of the node's structure. Due to an issue in the network stack's IPv6 subsystem [...]

"input: Question: I am just wondering about the difference between: in contrast to and in contrast with 
Answer: Eilia's and user239892's answers ARE correct: after 'in' we say 'in contrast to' but if we use contrast as a verb, we always use 'contrast with'. e.g. Your answer contrasts with Bill's. The third answer is wrong, in contrast to the first two.

"input: Question: A few days ago, a friend and I were discussing how every ""rule"" of English spelling or pronunciation has an exception, and every exception has an exception as well. Then I brought up the rule of a ph cluster equaling an f sound (as in phonetic, elephant, morph, etc.) as a pronunciation rule that didn't have any exceptions I could think of. Is this a true hard-and-fast rule or does it have some exceptions as well? I'm not counting abbreviations such as pH scale. 
Answer: Ones that haven't been mentioned: upholstery upheld upheaval I took this further and ran the following fairly simple command in Linux that tries to solve this problem, I've commented each part of the command on the right in the interest of readability: look . | grep ph | # List words and filter out ones with ph. while read word ; do # Set variable $word to each word. espeak -qx ""$word"" | # Print phonetic pronounciation of the word. grep -q f || # If it doesn't have an f sound in it, echo ""$word"" # then print the word. done alphol Alphonist Alphonse Alphonsine Alphonsism Alphonso alphorn alphos alphosis archshepherd creephole cupholder haphazard haphazardly haphazardness lamphole loophole nonupholstered nympholepsia nympholepsy nympholept nympholeptic overshepherd peephole sheepherder sheepherding shepherd shepherdage shepherddom shepherdess shepherdhood Shepherdia shepherdish shepherdism shepherdize shepherdless shepherdlike shepherdling shepherdly shepherdry shepherdry Stephen sulpholeate sulpholeic taphole Theraphosa theraphose theraphosid Theraphosidae theraphosoid traphole undershepherd unshepherded unshepherding unupholstered uphand uphang upharbor upharrow uphasp upheal upheap uphearted upheaval upheavalist upheave upheaven upheld uphelm uphelya upher uphill uphillward uphoard uphoist uphold upholden upholder upholster upholstered upholsterer upholsteress upholsterous upholstery upholsterydom upholstress uphung uphurl Note that these results aren't perfect, its based on the phonetic information that the espeak program contains and also some slightly flawed logic that excludes words that have an 'f' in them. Like flophouse. I'd have to write a more sophisticated program to get better results. Another interesting thing you can do is calculate is the number of ph words overall vs. the list above. There are 12,148 words in the dictionary I'm using with 'ph' in them and there are 87 words above. So only about 0.72% of ph words are not pronounced with an 'f' sound.

"input: Question: I need a single-word to describe something good that (unexpectedly) resulted from something bad. This good thing could not have occurred without the bad event happening first, as a precursor. Example sentence: ""I got in a horrible car accident and broke my leg, but falling in love with my nurse at the hospital was the ____,"" (something like that). 
Answer: silver lining ""I got in a horrible car accident and broke my leg, but falling in love with my nurse at the hospital was the silver lining"" From Wikipedia A silver lining is a metaphor for optimism in the common English-language which means a negative occurrence may have a positive aspect to it. Etymonline says: a ""bright side"" which proverbially accompanies even the darkest trouble; by 1843, apparently from oft-quoted lines from Milton's ""Comus,"" where the silver lining is the light of the moon shining from behind the cloud. Was I deceived? or did a sable cloud Turn forth her silver lining on the night? I did not err, there does a sable cloud, Turn out her silver lining on the night And casts a gleam over this tufted grove. To which Thomas Warton added the commentary: ""When all succour eems to be lost, Heaven unexpectedly presents the ilver lining o a able cloud to the virtuous."".

"input: Question: So I thought I'm sure about this and my instincts say that: ""If anyone has seen them .."" would be right but then again when I said it like: ""If anyone have seen them .."" I started thinking which one would be the right one. Can you please guide me through which is the right one and why? P.S. English is not my first language. 
Answer: It's ""if anyone has"", because ""anyone"" functions as third person singular. It probably just seems right to use ""have"" because you would for any other number or person.

"input: Question: On a Physics specification, it says: 6.7 Know how to use two permanent magnets to produce a uniform magnetic field pattern. Isn't it ""produce an uniform magnetic field"", or is the existing ""produce a uniform magnetic field pattern"" correct? 
Answer: The rule of placing an before a vowel is actually to place an before a vowel sound. Therefore, because uniform is pronounced with a ""y"" sound (/junfm/), which is not a vowel sound, it takes an a before it.

"input: Question: It is for a cover letter, where I want to express my interest in the position and also to indicate that my profile matches the requirement. I find the proposed job interesting and matched by my profile and career goal. First, does ""I find the proposed job interesting"" sound too ego-centric? Second, shall I break the sentence into two or keep it compact in one? Third, any better way for saying that my profile meets their requirements? Any help on any of these questions will be appreciated. ////// 
Answer: Oh my. About the only thing good I can say about your cover letter is that you knew to ask for help. Your original statement doesn't convey what it literally says. The primary point any reader is going to take away is ""English is not my first language and I have difficulty communicating."" masarah's improvement is... an improvement. But it's not going to get you the job in a competitive market. The awkward word choice and sentence construction is gone, although it still is passive and overly wordy. Worse, it still gives the distinct impression that you're sending the same cover letter to dozens of companies, and probably didn't even read the requirements that you say you meet. The primary problem is that you're trying to evaluate your own suitability for the position. That simply won't fly. For one thing, it implies that the recruiter or HR department is redundant, which is going to make a bad impression on the first person to see your resume, even if it were true. Bigger issue: why would they trust your assessment, since you're obviously biased (you want them to offer you the job). My high school English teacher (English is my first language, so this was a writing course, not a foreign language course) gave the advice ""show, don't tell"", and this applies in this situation. Don't tell them ""My profile matches the requirements."" or ""My experience matches the requirements."" Instead pull a couple highlights from your resume that you feel give you the necessary background, and say something like ""I look forward to applying my experience taking notes in class to making sure your medical records are clear and concise and don't miss any important details."" Of course, you should talk about your actual experience and the tasks that you will do in the position you are applying for. Same thing goes for expressing interest in the position. You did some research on what the company does, right? You don't want to say, ""I'm interested in this position because it meets my career goals."" Instead, ""I'm excited about joining your team that is on the cutting edge of research in whatever."" or ""I feel that the work your company does in providing education to the unemployed is vitally important. I would love to help give people a second chance at life."" Make it specific to the work this position entails, and your prior related experience. Let them draw the conclusion that you're a good fit. If you want to make it easy for the recruiter to check that you meet the requirements, use a highlighter on your resume. But that's not what a cover letter is for.

"input: Question: Is there a word which has this definition: usage of vulgar or abusive words too often especially while chatting or talking to someone or while giving a speech. What do you call a person who uses abusive words too often without needing to. 
Answer: Two excellent choices exist. The first can be used as either an adjective or noun, in slightly different forms: foulmouth, adj. and n. B. n. A foul-mouthed person. [""foulmouth, adj. and n."". OED Online. June 2016. Oxford University Press. (accessed August 21, 2016).] The adjective 'foulmouth' is obsolete in that form. Instead, the current version is 'foulmouthed': foul-mouthed, adj. Of persons and their utterances: Using obscene, profane, or scurrilous language. [""foul-mouthed, adj."". OED Online. June 2016. Oxford University Press. (accessed August 21, 2016).] The second choice is not so commonly used, and is only found as a noun. However, there's no mistaking its meaning: muck-spout n. regional and slang a person who uses obscene or foul language. [""muck, n.1"". OED Online. June 2016. Oxford University Press. (accessed August 21, 2016).].

"input: Question: This very well may just be outside our lexicon at the moment, due to the fact that space travel is extremely limited, but I am looking for the proper terminology to refer to a space vessel that had been rendered a wreck or a derelict, and was repaired and refitted into a workable vessel. In naval terms, a sunk vessel would be refloated, but that term is awkward to use in space. Something like reatmosphered fits the context, but it is awkward and not in the lexicon (though its form makes its intent clear, and could be readily used). Any ideas? 
Answer: I would be inclined to suggest relaunched. The first time a spacecraft is sent into space, it is launched; if it's recovered and sent into space again, it's launched again - that is, relaunched. The term is also used in a maritime context, for ships that have been repaired/refit in drydock, but which were never officially declared unusable/decommissioned.

"input: Question: If a possessive noun, which is plural, is preceded by ""each"", then should it use the singular or plural possessive form? For example, which of the following is correct? spend time in each other's presence spend time in each others' presence 
Answer: Surely it's always each others Each other is a (reciprocal) pronoun, so in its possessive case it becomes a possessive pronoun. None of the others: its, his, hers, yours, whose etc has an apostrophe. Adding one is generally seen as a sign of poor literacy.
