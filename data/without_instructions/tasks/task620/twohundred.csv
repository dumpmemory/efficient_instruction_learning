"input: Abstract: Based on our preliminary studies and the results of this study, we conclude that argon laser welding of 4-8 mm internal diameter veins, arteries, and arteriovenous fistulas may have several potential advantages compared to conventional suture techniques. The benefits of laser repairs may include improved mechanical properties, and absence of the foreign body response related to sutures. Laser welding is sterile, nontactile and possibly time conserving, and the wounds heal rapidly without aneurysms or excess tissue proliferation.

"input: Abstract: The System 7 pump/actuator/engine combination has demonstrated biologic compatibility and physiologic effectiveness and responsiveness in five TVAS in vivo studies. The recent 75-day implant supports the feasibility of extended reliability of the system components. Postoperative system maintenance was necessary only because of the nonhermetic design of System 7. However, the ability to pump 11 l/min at 120 beats/min, synchronize at beat rates of 144 beats/min, and pump against mean arterial pressures of more than 150 mmHg while maintaining hematologic and biochemical values within physiologic range sets a very optimistic stage for System 8 hardware. A System 8 concept is shown in Figure 14. The System 8 hardware will include a thermal salt package capable of providing completely untethered circulatory support for a nominal 8-h period. Recharge will be accomplished with a transcutaneous transformer in 1 h. Thermal management problems become minimal, with an average energy input of 15.8 W (peak of 24.9 W). The human preclinical testing of System 8 will start in 1988.

"input: Abstract: The roller screw electric VAD is easier to manufacture and 25% lighter than the previously described drum cam model. This device requires 12 to 15 W to pump 6 to 8 l/min with minimal hemolysis. The motor drive has functioned for periods up to 93 days in vivo with no measurable wear. The compliance chamber volume varies by 100 cc during VAD function but does so while maintaining pressure variations below 15 mmHg. Compliance chamber volume loss of 2 to 5 cc/day is explained by gas transport through SPU. The subcutaneous sampling port provides ready access to the sealed system.

"input: Abstract: In order to perform quantitative in vitro and clinical studies on the removal of Al by the combined therapy of DFO administration and HD, an HPLC system for measuring DFO was established and a leaky membrane with enhanced permeability to middle molecular substances was developed. The DFO infusion caused rises in plasma Al levels (regarded as indicating the elution of accumulated Al) in patients undergoing HD. Plasma levels increased most in long-term patients and those with bone pain. Examination of Al clearances demonstrated that this increased plasma Al content passed through HD membranes at levels of more than 80 micrograms/l, and that the leaky membrane was more effective for removal of Al as well as DFO than the conventional one. Although a 1:1 complex between DFO and Al in an aqueous solution was confirmed, the formation of Al-rich complexes in vivo was suggested. It is concluded that Al-DFO complex formed in vivo can be effectively removed across the leaky membrane.

"input: Abstract: With 111In-labeled platelets and 125I-labeled bovine fibrinogen, regional mapping of platelet and fibrinogen deposition on leaflets and sewing rings was obtained. Ten Holstein calves received 25-mm mitral valves (ISLM) and were killed 1, 14, and 30 days after implantation. Twenty-four hours before the calves were killed, 350 to 450 microCi of 111In-labeled platelets and 200 to 250 microCi of 125I-labeled bovine fibrinogen were administered intravenously. The components of the tissue valves, i.e., three leaflets and sewing rings, were separated. Each leaflet was cut into four sections: free edge, central zone, flexion zone, and attachment zone. From the radioactivity in blood, leaflet zones, sewing rings, area of leaflet zones, platelet count, and fibrinogen level in blood, the mean regional density of adherent platelets, fibrinogen-fibrin, and fibrinogen/platelet were calculated. The density of platelets and fibrinogen deposited on the components of the valves decreases with time postimplantation. The number of fibrinogen molecules per platelet is fivefold to 20-fold higher than that of the receptor concentration on platelets on leaflet zones, suggesting the heterogeneity of fibrinogen-fibrin in thrombus and components of the valve.

"input: Abstract: This study demonstrates that 20 to 30 microns porous, Replamineform silicone rubber prostheses remain isocompliant with adjacent arterial segments up to 8 months following implantation. This finding contrasts with the results of currently available prostheses, including autologous vein, which rapidly become minimally compliant. We conclude that this vascular construction is stable over the long-term following implantation and may improve the success of small internal diameter arterial reconstruction by eliminating failures caused by intimal hyperplasia.

"input: Abstract: To summarize the results: Bilirubin removal by hemoperfusion was successfully performed for the first time on a premature infant. The hemoperfusion caused no adverse effects on the clinical state of the infant. The bilirubin removed in 90 min--13 mg--indicates the existence of a large extravascular pool. Hemoperfusion is suggested for bilirubin removal from newborn babies, reducing the need for blood exchange with bank blood.

"input: Abstract: In the 4 years January 1981 to December 1984, 186 children received 1362 halothane anaesthetics. Twenty-five patients were anaesthetized with halothane at least 10 times in a year. No patient developed postoperative jaundice. Sixty-nine children were exposed to two halothane anaesthetics within 28 days on 149 occasions and serial estimations of serum liver enzyme concentrations were obtained. Minor increases in the concentrations of serum AST and ALT were recorded in 10.6% and 4.7% of patient entries, respectively. Postoperative GGT and SAP concentrations were increased in 2.7% of patient entries. Patients in whom enzyme values were increased before the first anaesthetic were no more likely than other subjects to develop further changes.

"input: Abstract: The effects of atracurium and alcuronium on the evoked mechanical and electromyographic responses of the adductor pollicis were investigated in 30 adult patients. The ulnar nerve was stimulated with trains of four supramaximal pulses of 0.2 ms duration and a frequency of 2 Hz at intervals of 20 s. The mechanical response was measured using a strain gauge force transducer and the evoked compound action potential (ECAP) was recorded simultaneously using a Medelec MS91 electromyography system. Depression of the electromyographic and mechanical responses, caused by atracurium, was similar during onset and antagonism of blockade. During onset of blockade by alcuronium, the mechanical response was depressed to a significantly greater extent compared with the ECAP. This difference was not observed during antagonism with neostigmine. The rates of onset of atracurium and alcuronium were generally similar, but the rate of onset of mechanical fade was greater in the alcuronium group. There was no significant quantitative difference between the rates of antagonism of alcuronium and atracurium when assessed by the mechanical first response ratio. Electromyographic first response and electromyographic and mechanical train-of-four ratios recovered more rapidly in the atracurium group. These findings suggest that the differences between mechanical and electromyographic measurements of neuromuscular blockade are drug-specific and are more pronounced during the onset of blockade than during its antagonism by neostigmine.

"input: Abstract: The effectiveness of neostigmine 0.07 mg kg-1 and edrophonium 0.8 mg kg-1 as antagonists of profound neuromuscular blockade induced by vecuronium 0.1 mg kg-1 or atracurium 0.5 mg kg-1 was studied in 59 healthy patients. The antagonists were administered 5 min after total ablation of the twitch response and the end-point of recovery was a train-of-four ratio of 70%. In 30 patients given vecuronium the mean time to reach this point (duration TOF70) was 66.7 min in the control group (no antagonist), 43.5 min in the group given neostigmine and 59.8 min in the group given edrophonium. The duration TOF70 was shorter in the neostigmine group than in the control (P less than 0.01) and edrophonium (P less than 0.01) groups. The duration TOF70 did not differ from control in the edrophonium group. In 29 patients given atracurium, the durations TOF70 were 66.4, 44.1 and 54.9 min in the control, neostigmine and edrophonium groups, respectively. The durations TOF70 in the neostigmine (P less than 0.01) and edrophonium (P less than 0.01), groups were shorter than control. The duration TOF70 of the neostigmine group was shorter than in the edrophonium group (P less than 0.01). These results show that profound neuromuscular blockade cannot be rapidly antagonized by either of these two agents, but if reversal is required under these circumstances, neostigmine would be the more effective drug.

"input: Abstract: Antagonism of atracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade by neostigmine or edrophonium has been studied using the tetanic (50 Hz) and train-of-four (2 Hz) or single twitch responses of the adductor pollicis muscle in 22 anaesthetized patients. A further nine patients not given an anticholinesterase acted as a control group. In two groups (six patients for each anticholinesterase) in whom antagonism was attempted at 95-98% blockade of the tetanic response, recovery of the tetanic response after two or three doses of edrophonium 0.75 mg kg-1 i.v. was not statistically different from that in the control group; recovery after two doses of neostigmine 2.5 mg i.v. was significantly faster (P less than 0.001). Recovery of the single twitch response after antagonism with edrophonium, although longer than that with neostigmine (P less than 0.01), was significantly shorter than in the control group (P less than 0.05). When edrophonium is given at the commencement of recovery, the initial rapid antagonism of tetanic block is not sustained, whereas antagonism by neostigmine is more persistent and the recovery phase is significantly shortened. In a further two groups of patients (n = 5) given atracurium 0.3 mg kg-1 i.v., antagonism was not attempted until the peak height of the tetanic contraction had reached approximately 50% of the control value.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

"input: Abstract: The characteristics of train-of-four recovery after atracurium or vecuronium were studied, under enflurane anaesthesia, and compared with those associated with tubocurarine-induced blockade. Ten patients each received vecuronium 0.1 mg kg-1, atracurium 0.5 mg kg-1 or tubocurarine 0.5 mg kg-1. Neuromuscular blockade was calculated as the percent depression of the first twitch, and was determined at the time of reappearance of the second, third and fourth twitches of the train-of-four. The pattern during recovery from blockade induced by the three neuromuscular blocking agents was similar, with T2, T3 and T4 reappearing at approximately 93%, 89% and 86% residual blockade, respectively. These results are different from those previously reported by Lee (1975) indicating that, under enflurane anaesthesia, the train-of-four count may give an incorrect estimate of the degree of neuromuscular blockade.

"input: Abstract: The pharmacokinetics of the long-acting anticholinesterase drug, galanthamine, were investigated in eight patients. After i.v. injection of 0.3 mg kg-1, the decrease in the serum concentration of galanthamine followed a biexponential curve. The serum concentration decreased rapidly from 543 +/- 47 ng ml-1 to 128 +/- 14 ng ml-1 between 2 and 30 min with a T1/2 alpha of 6.42 +/- 2.15 min, and then declined more slowly with a T1/2 beta of 264 +/- 28 min. Total serum clearance of galanthamine amounted to 5.37 +/- 0.87 ml min-1 kg-1, and the renal clearance was 1.36 +/- 0.10 ml min-1 kg-1. The cumulative urinary excretion of galanthamine between 0 and 48 h after injection amounted to 28.0 +/- 5.4% of the administered dose. The biliary excretion of galanthamine during 24 h amounted to 0.2 +/- 0.1% of the dose. There was no evidence of glucuronide or sulphate conjugation of galanthamine.

"input: Abstract: Blood flow through and chlormethiazole extraction ratios across lungs, liver, kidneys and gut were measured in awake unrestrained sheep (controls) and with the same animals anaesthetized with 1.5% halothane or whilst undergoing high thoracic subarachnoid blockade with amethocaine. In the control-drug studies, chlormethiazole infused to sub-sedative blood concentrations produced no significant changes in haemodynamics or in the kinetics of iodohippurate (renal and hepatic blood flows). Chlormethiazole was eliminated predominantly by the liver (mean extraction ratio and clearance, respectively, 0.90 and 1.3 litre min-1) and lungs (0.15; 0.6 litre min-1). Renal clearance was absent or negligible (greater than 0.1 litre min-1). Because of pulmonary clearance, mean total body clearance was derived from analysis of pulmonary arterial concentrations. Under general anaesthesia, there were significant reductions in mean cardiac output, hepatic and renal blood flow (to 54%, 63% and 43% of control); chlormethiazole mean hepatic extraction ratios and clearance were reduced, respectively, to 82% and 56% of control, and its pulmonary and renal clearances were abolished. With subarachnoid anaesthesia there were no significant changes in haemodynamics or in chlormethiazole extraction ratios or clearances.

"input: Abstract: Active forms of vitamin D3, 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, were administered in an open-design study to 40 patients with psoriasis vulgaris in three ways: to 17 patients 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 was given orally at a dose of 1.0 micrograms/day for 6 months, to four patients 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was given orally at a dose of 0.5 microgram/day for 6 months, and 19 patients were given 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 applied topically at concentration of 0.5 microgram/g of base for 8 weeks. Improvement was observed at the end of the individual study periods in 13 (76%) patients in Group 1 with a mean period of treatment (+/- SD) of 2.7 +/- 0.6 months, in one patient in Group 2 at 3 months after the start of treatment, and in 16 (84%) patients in Group 3 when the chemical was applied for 3.3 +/- 1.2 weeks. No side-effects were observed in any of these trials. These data suggest that psoriasis may respond to active metabolites of vitamin D3 and that abnormalities in vitamin D metabolism or in responsiveness of the skin cells to active metabolites of vitamin D may be involved in the pathogenesis of this skin disease.

"input: Abstract: We treated 11 psoriatic patients with topical 1 alpha,24-dihydroxycholecalciferol, a new synthetic analogue of active vitamin D3. In 10 of 15 tests the lesions cleared completely within 1-4 weeks, although some relapses occurred shortly after cessation of treatment. There were no side-effects. We suggest that 1 alpha, 24(OH)2D3 merits further investigation as a potentially useful topical therapy for psoriasis.

"input: Abstract: The effect of indomethacin gel on UVB and UVC erythema was assessed objectively using a reflectance instrument. When indomethacin was applied immediately after irradiation, UVR (ultraviolet radiation) dose-dependent suppression of erythema was demonstrated for both wavelengths until 36 h after irradiation when both indomethacin and control gel base-treated sites were equally erythematous. Suppression of erythema also occurred when application of indomethacin was delayed until 24 h after irradiation, showing that for both wavelengths prostaglandin synthesis remains increased throughout this period. The degree of suppression at any time, however, was no greater than that achieved by a single application immediately after irradiation, indicating that the eventual equal erythema of indomethacin and gel base-treated sites was not due to tachyphylaxis or inadequate dosage. Construction of dose-response curves for the indomethacin-responsive and indomethacin-unresponsive components of erythema shows that in human skin the difference in erythemal response to UVB and UVC radiation is not due to the formation of different mediators at these wavelengths.

"input: Abstract: A behavioural method of habit reversal, in combination with a hydrocortisone cream, was compared with the use of cream alone in the treatment of 17 patients with atopic dermatitis. The patients were assigned randomly to two groups, one of which received the combination treatment and the other regular ointment treatment. The patients' skin status was assessed before and after treatment, and the patients recorded their scratching during the study. Both groups improved, but the group which received habit-reversal therapy improved significantly more. A strong correlation was found between reduction in scratching and improvement in skin status.

"input: Abstract: Percutaneous absorption of hydrocortisone was studied in 18 children (aged from 6 weeks to 14 1/2 years) with atopic or seborrhoeic dermatitis, by measuring their serum cortisol before and after application of 1% hydrocortisone cream. Endogenous secretion of cortisol was suppressed with dexamethasone. A 24 h absorption test was performed on nine children. In six, percutaneous absorption was detected. The highest serum cortisol level was reached within the first 6 h. A 4 h absorption test was developed on the basis of the 24 h test. This short absorption test was performed on nine children, and in eight of them absorption of hydrocortisone was detected. The rise of serum cortisol ranged from 98 to 2669 nmol/l. The 2 h ACTH test was performed to evaluate the effect of previous treatment with topical glucocorticoids. Suppressed adrenocortical function was found in five of 13 children, and was associated significantly with high post-application serum cortisol levels. This occurred more often in infants with a severe skin disorder than in older children or in those with mild or moderate skin disease.

"input: Abstract: Retrospective analysis of 82 pregnancies in women with either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease suggested that, in general, neither disease had a major effect on pregnancy outcome. The birth-weights of babies born to women with inflammatory bowel disease were marginally lower than those born to women in a control group matched for age and parity, but the difference was statistically significant only in women with Crohn's disease. In both disease groups there was a higher frequency of low haemoglobin levels in pregnancy than in the matched control groups. There were no statistically significant effects of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease on duration of pregnancy, mode of delivery or raised blood pressure and/or proteinuria. In the absence of a relapse, a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease should not influence obstetric management.

The study included 30 healthy non-pregnant women and 90 healthy pregnant women equally distributed across the three trimesters. Two variables were investigated: the number of mononuclear cells in phagocytosis and the average number of bacteria per monocyte in phagocytosis. As pregnancy progressed a gradual and significant increase was found in the number of monocytes in phagocytosis and a significantly higher proportion of macrophages with six or more bacteria per phagocyte.

"input: Abstract: Labrador keratopathy (LK) is an acquired corneal degeneration thought to be caused by chronic exposure to solar irradiation. Reports so far suggest that it is a progressive or at least a stationary condition. There are no detailed reports on recommended therapy. A prospective clinical study was conducted to show regression of LK following extracapsular cataract extraction. Seventeen black patients (26 eyes) with LK and mature cataracts underwent extracapsular cataract extraction. The severity of the LK was recorded photographically pre- and postoperatively. The follow-up ranged from 6 to fifteen months. Twenty-four eyes (92%) showed regression of the LK. The reduction in exposure to ultraviolet light as a result of aphakic photophobia could be one of the factors which have led to the regression of the LK.

"input: Abstract: The murine IgG2a monoclonal antibody 6-19 binds to a wide variety of nonhematopoietic cells including human marrow-derived stromal cells but does not bind to marrow or peripheral blood cells. We studied the effects of this antibody and rabbit complement on marrow cells. Fibroblast colonies were eliminated from light density marrow cells by a single incubation with monoclonal antibody 6-19 and complement. The growth and composition of granulocytic and erythroid colonies were unaffected. Specific complement mediated cytotoxicity of the antibody was confirmed on passaged human fibroblasts derived from marrow (more than 99.6% of fibroblasts are killed by a single treatment). Similar results were obtained with human umbilical cord endothelial cells. In addition, such treatment abolished the initiation of Dexter culture stroma. Incubation of bone marrow cell suspensions with this antibody and complement will allow the study of stroma-free marrow cells in long-term liquid cultures.

"input: Abstract: Epinephrine causes platelet aggregation and secretion by interacting with alpha 2-adrenergic receptors on the platelet surface. Platelet aggregation requires the binding of fibrinogen to a specific receptor on the membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex. Although the IIb-IIIa complex is identifiable on the surface of resting platelets, the fibrinogen receptor is expressed only after platelet activation. The current studies were designed to examine the effect of occupancy of platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors by epinephrine on the expression of fibrinogen receptors and on the aggregation of platelets. The ability of epinephrine to induce the expression of fibrinogen receptors was studied under two different conditions: acute stimulation (less than 1 min) and prolonged stimulation (50 to 90 min), the latter of which is associated with a reduction or ""desensitization"" of the platelet aggregation response. Expression of the fibrinogen receptor was monitored with 125I-fibrinogen as well as with 125I-PAC-1 (PAC-1), a monoclonal antibody that binds to the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex only after platelets are activated. Epinephrine caused an immediate increase in PAC-1 and fibrinogen binding that was dependent on occupancy of the alpha 2-receptor by epinephrine and on the presence of extracellular free Ca (KCa = 30 mumol/L). By itself, 1 mmol/L Mg was unable to support induction of the fibrinogen receptor by epinephrine. However, it did decrease the Ca requirement by about two orders of magnitude. Prolonged stimulation of unstirred platelets by epinephrine led to a 70% decrease in the aggregation response when the platelets were subsequently stirred. Despite their decreased aggregation response, desensitized platelets bound PAC-1 and fibrinogen normally, indicating that the loss of aggregation was not due simply to a decrease in fibrinogen receptor expression. Although desensitization was not affected by pretreatment of the platelets with aspirin, it was partially prevented when extracellular Ca was chelated by EDTA during the long incubation with epinephrine. These studies demonstrate that once platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are occupied by epinephrine, extracellular Ca is involved in initiating the aggregation response by supporting the induction of the fibrinogen receptor and the binding of fibrinogen. Furthermore. Ca-dependent reactions subsequent to fibrinogen binding may be necessary for maximal platelet aggregation and are impaired when platelets become desensitized to epinephrine.

"input: Abstract: We examined the activity of defensins, cysteine-rich cationic peptides that are abundant in the cytoplasmic granules of human and rabbit granulocytes, against various tumor targets. The three human defensins, HNP-1, HNP-2, and HNP-3, lysed human and murine targets in chromium release and dye exclusion assays. Defensin-mediated tumor cell lysis was concentration-dependent, inhibited by serum, and dependent on temperature-sensitive events. Lysis was first detected by three hours of incubation and it reached a plateau between eight and 14 hours. In vitro exposure of murine teratocarcinoma cells to HNP 1-3 abrogated their oncogenicity in vivo. Nonmalignant target cells were also susceptible to defensin-mediated lysis. Four rabbit granulocyte defensins exerted marked (NP-1, NP-2) or moderate (NP-3a, NP-3b) cytotoxic activity, whereas defensin NP-5 was not cytotoxic. When tumor cells were incubated with human defensins in combination with hydrogen peroxide, synergistic cytotoxicity was detected. As defensins are released from granulocytes by various stimuli, their release could contribute to extracellular cytotoxicity which is independent of reactive oxygen intermediates.

"input: Abstract: The reported incidence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is higher than that of the general population. Unusual susceptibility to PUD in RA, independent of therapy, has been suggested. To compare RA patients with others who had similar drug exposure but no known predisposition to PUD, 120 patients hospitalized for treatment of severe arthritis (65 with RA, 55 with osteoarthritis) were assessed by questionnaire for PUD history, drug history and other relevant variables. The relationship of PUD to sex distribution, smoking, alcohol consumption and anti-inflammatory therapy followed expected patterns. We found high but similar PUD rates in RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients (RA 15%, OA 18%). This suggests that a common factor (probably drugs) is responsible. We feel that the documented high incidence of PUD in RA is most probably related to drug therapy. Available methods cannot determine if PUD ever occurs as a primary manifestation of RA.

"input: Abstract: Rates of superoxide (SA) generation by blood monocytes stimulated ex vivo were studied before and during corticosteroid treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, in control patients and in healthy controls. The direct effect on stimulated SA production of pre-incubating cells with prednisolone in vitro was also studied. Significant inhibition of monocyte SA output stimulated with IgG-treated zymosan (ITZ) and fluoride ion (F), but not serum-treated zymosan (STZ) was demonstrated following steroid therapy in RA. No inhibitory effect of prednisolone could be demonstrated in vitro, using ITZ, STZ and F as stimuli. Our data on blood monocyte yields, size and cytochemistry suggest that the in vivo effect is due to a shift in blood monocyte traffic.

"input: Abstract: Methotrexate (MTX) appears to be useful in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) refractory to other drugs but its long-term toxicity and efficacy are uncertain. A retrospective study of MTX in such patients in comparison with the purine analogues, azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine was made using life-table analysis. Eighty-four patients took MTX in a median dose of 7.5 mg/week whilst 55 received purine analogues, 100 mg/day (median). By 12 months, 19.3% of patients had ceased MTX due to toxicity, compared with 29.3% for purine analogues. Toxicity severe enough to warrant stopping therapy was uncommon after 8 months with either drug. At 12 months 61.5% of the MTX patients had achieved defined criteria of improvement compared with 25.6% for the purine analogues (p less than 0.05). The number of patients improving on purine analogues did not increase substantially after 6 months, whereas the number improving with MTX continued to 12 months. MTX in a low-dose regimen is useful in refractory RA and superior to low-dose purine analogues.

We were unable to show any abnormality in the excretion of Zn, Mg or GAG. In 11 patients, a low level of urinary citrate was a significant feature that was associated in most cases with a urinary pH value above 6. Citrate concentration (per litre) and output (per 24 h) were found to be lower than in the controls in 19 and 33% respectively of the determinations. The overall ratio of average urinary citrate concentration in patients and controls was 0.56, a figure in agreement with previous data.

"input: Abstract: Five cases of clinically manifest solitary and bilateral renal lesions metastatic from the lung are presented. These cases are unusual in that renal metastases are usually silent lesions discovered at autopsy. Review of the autopsy data from this hospital identified renal metastases in 19% of patients who died from carcinoma of the lung. This incidence parallels that of other series. A solid renal lesion which is identified in a patient with a history of pulmonary carcinoma should raise the suspicion of renal metastases, especially if computed tomography of the mass demonstrates relative homogeneity and minimal enhancement. More frequent use of the abdominal CT scan in staging patients with lung cancer will render metastatic carcinoma from lung to kidney a more frequent ante mortem diagnosis.

"input: Abstract: Eleven patients with vesicoureteric reflux secondary to neuropathic bladder were treated by endoscopic injection of pyrolised polytetrafluoroethylene (Polytef) paste. Thirteen of the 15 ureters treated showed disappearance of reflux after one injection. The amount of Polytef paste injected varied from 0.2 to 0.9 ml (mean 0.45 ml). There were no complications, except in one ureter where distension of the collecting system was slightly increased compared with the pre-operative urogram.

"input: Abstract: A graphic representation of the micturition cycle by a pressure-volume plot has been obtained in 120 women, both incontinent patients and normal controls. The pattern of contraction during voiding allowed prediction of the outcome of treatment. Patients with urethral sphincter incompetence and a sustained detrusor contraction had a good result from colposuspension even if detrusor instability was found during filling. Where the urethral sphincter was competent, patients with urge incontinence with or without detrusor instability during filling cystometry had a good response to drugs, providing a sustained detrusor contraction was present during voiding. Urethral sphincter incompetence was characterised by a low detrusor voiding pressure.

"input: Abstract: Eighty-four patients with haematuria were seen during 1976 and 1977. This symptom was investigated but no definite cause could be found. Five or more years later they were followed up. Although some patients had experienced further urological symptoms, none was found to have developed a malignancy in the genito-urinary tract. Possible causes of their bleeding are discussed.

"input: Abstract: Twenty-five patients with fracture of the penis were treated surgically between 1968 and 1984. Long-term follow-up was obtained in 17. In no case were there any early post-operative complications. All patients stated that they were achieving normal, painless erections; two patients developed a slight penile curvature but this did not affect their sexual activities. We strongly recommend early surgical intervention because of these encouraging results. Urethral injury associated with the fracture did not occur in this series.

"input: Abstract: Spastic patients were instructed to make accurate, rapid ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion movements over different distances to a target. Ankle position and surface electromyograms (EMGs) from tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles were recorded. In 3 of 8 spastic patients tested, dorsiflexion evoked velocity-dependent activation of the antagonist (SOL) muscle which impeded the movement to the extent that the limb unintentionally reversed movement direction. We propose that this activation is reflex in origin since it is tightly synchronized, has a large peak amplitude, occurs about 50 ms after the initiation of the movement, and is velocity dependent. One of the 3 patients who had reflex-induced antagonist activation in dorsiflexion also demonstrated sustained clonus during plantarflexion. This usually occurred only if the target had been overshot so that the return of the limb stretched the soleus muscle and triggered clonus. We conclude that in some patients, hyperactive stretch reflexes cause movement deficits.

"input: Abstract: Skilled forelimb use was studied in rats with unilateral lesions of the sensorimotor cortex, the caudate-putamen, or the dopaminergic nigrostriatal bundle, in a task involving reaching for food. Limb preference and efficiency were evaluated, as well as the relationship between limb use, spontaneous, and methamphetamine-induced rotation bias, both preoperatively and postoperatively. To induce use of the nonpreferred limb, a bracelet, which prevented reaching but not other movements, was attached to the forearm of the preferred forelimb. Whereas small cortical lesions of the forepaw area of the sensorimotor cortex mildly influenced limb preference and use, larger lesions changed preference. Furthermore, medium-sized sensorimotor cortex lesions impaired contralateral limb use, although surprising recovery occurred on the forced tests with the bracelet. Large cortical lesions abolished effective reaching even on the forced tests. Impairments similar to those following sensorimotor cortex lesions were also obtained following small and large caudate-putamen lesions. By contrast, unilateral dopamine depletions not only blocked use of the limb contralateral to the depletion but also impaired use of the ipsilateral limb. There was recovery in use of the ipsilateral forelimb but not the contralateral forelimb. Correlational analysis showed a weak relation between methamphetamine-induced rotation and limb preference preoperatively but no significant relation between these two variables postoperatively. The similarity in the deficits following sensorimotor cortex lesions and basal ganglia lesions suggests that skilled forelimb use depends upon a shared neural organization within the two systems.

"input: Abstract: This study investigates the hypothesis that, as a consequence of Parkinson's disease, disturbed caudate outflow will lead to deficits in cognitive functions dependent upon the integrity of the prefrontal cortex, the cortical focus of caudatofugal signals. Since Parkinson's disease also involves lesions in extra-striatal midbrain cells which reduce the extrinsic supply of dopamine to this cortical region, such functions are at double risk. Forty nondemented parkinsonian patients were drawn from a pool of 100 consecutive patients and matched with 40 normal control subjects according to age, education, IQ, and sex. All patients were quantitatively rated on neurological indices of disease. Neuropsychological assessment of the patient and normal groups included tests of general intelligence, psychomotor skills, memory, visuospatial and executive functions. No global cognitive decline was observed in the parkinsonian group. Moreover, memory and visuospatial abilities were generally intact. A small cluster of deficits emerged, interpreted as reflecting impairment in the ability to spontaneously generate efficient strategies when relying on self-directed task-specific planning. In addition, several tests thought to be sensitive to frontal lobe function distinguished patients with symptoms strongly lateralized to the right versus left side of the body. Deficits in strategic planning were later investigated in relation to severity of disease and to patient attributes including IQ and age, both of which were relevant to performance on specific tasks. Results were compared with previous investigations in parkinsonian patients and discussed from the perspective of both animal and human studies involving damage to the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. As the prefrontal cortex is thought to play a crucial role in self-directed behavioural planning, the validity of an outflow model in predicting the consequences of caudate nucleus dysfunction was supported.

"input: Abstract: The study was designed to investigate the changes in axonal transport that result from disturbances in protein synthesis. Doxorubicin, an antineoplastic drug which interferes with the function of DNA, has a selective effect on peripheral sensory nerves because of the high vascular permeability in the dorsal root ganglia. After the intravenous administration of a moderate dose (4 mg/kg) to male Wistar rats, the transport of slow component a (SCa) was found to be retarded, transport velocity being decreased by 17% (0.85 +/- 0.06 mm/day vs 1.03 +/- 0.06 mm/day in controls). The transport kinetics of the fast anterograde and retrograde components (aFC and rFC) were unchanged after the administration of a dose of 6 mg/kg, although the relative amount of aFC was decreased by 27% (3.2 +/- 0.9% vs 4.4 +/- 1.1% in controls). It is suggested that the neuronopathy induced by doxorubicin is mediated by changes in axonal transport.

"input: Abstract: The clinical features of 66 patients with histologically defined mitochondrial myopathy are described. The age of onset of symptoms ranged from birth to 68 years, but was before 20 years in 61%. Nineteen patients had similarly affected relatives. Three groups of cases could be identified clinically: a combination of progressive external ophthalmoplegia and weakness of the limbs induced or increased by exertion (55%); such limb weakness alone (18%); and those with clinical features, such as ataxia, dementia, deafness, involuntary movements and seizures, predominantly or exclusively arising from the CNS (27%). There was considerable overlap between these groups, and pigmentary retinopathy, present in 36% of patients, occurred in all three. At a mean disease duration of twenty years, 9 patients (all from Group 3) were severely disabled but 42 were still able to work. In vitro studies of mitochondrial metabolism, performed in 33 cases, most commonly showed deficiencies of the mitochondrial respiratory chain localized to complex I (18 patients) or complex III (9). No typical clinical picture emerged for any of the identifiable biochemical defects.

"input: Abstract: In a three-dimensional study of the distribution of anterior horn cells in the C8 segment of the human spinal cord we have recognized lateral and medial zones of motor neuron groupings, but have not been able to recognize subgroups of neurons within these groupings resembling the anatomical columns described by earlier investigators. This observation does not invalidate the concept of functional groupings within these anterior horn cell pools. In studies of the same segment in cords obtained at autopsy from patients with motor neuron disease, zones of focal loss of motor neurons were identified, without consistent severity or distribution at different sectional levels. These findings imply varying resistance to the disease in different pools of motor neurons.

"input: Abstract: Five children, aged 6 to 16 years, were tested for unilateral discrimination and interhemispheric transfer of tactile information as well as tactuomotor learning at various intervals before and after therapeutic callosotomy. Comparison of preoperative and postoperative capacities revealed that younger children are considerably less affected by the interruption of callosal transmission than older children. Bilateral organization of speech and participation of the anterior commissure can largely be excluded as possible compensatory mechanisms. The most plausible explanation for the excellent preservation of interhemispheric integration of tactile functions in the younger patients appears to be continued reliance on ipsilateral pathways. The relatively greater deficits observed in the older children, on the other hand, suggest that sensorimotor functions come to depend more extensively on contralateral pathways as the corpus callosum reaches functional maturity.

"input: Abstract: Previous serial measurements of lymphocyte subpopulations in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) have demonstrated periodic reductions in the number of OKT8 positive (T8+) cells. In this longitudinal study, involving twice monthly samples from each participant and carried out in two phases lasting at least six and three months respectively, we have confirmed that fluctuations in T8+ cells occur in patients with MS and also found a significant reduction in this lymphocyte subpopulation in patients' spouses but not their siblings, compared with unrelated controls. The changes observed in spouses were related in time to those occurring in patients on 10/13 occasions from 5/9 families; no temporal relationship occurred in the remainder. Taking two or more low T8+ values as significant, 12/13 patients, 7/9 spouses, 6/13 siblings and 4/13 controls (chi 2 = 12.5; P less than 0.01) were abnormal at some stage. Our results provide indirect evidence for the role of environmental factors in determining certain immunological abnormalities present in patients with MS and illustrate the role of family studies in determining the specificity of these changes to the disease.

"input: Abstract: Previous research on visuospatial function in Parkinson's disease is reviewed. The present experiment was designed to test two fundamental aspects of spatial ability, namely right-left discrimination and the manipulation of those concepts in different spatial perspectives. Measures of accuracy and reaction time were taken. The performance of patients with Parkinson's disease did not differ from that of normal subjects in the spatial components of the task. Neither a review of the literature, nor the results of the present study, give support to the idea of a generalized visuospatial deficit in Parkinson's disease.

"input: Abstract: A rabbit inhalation injury model using a dual tracer radioactive isotope technique (Rowland et al., 1986), has been utilized with small- and medium-sized molecular weight tracers. There is oedema formation at 2 h after smoke inhalation or fluid resuscitation and especially with the combination of inhalation injury and fluid resuscitation [corrected]. This oedema appears to have decreased by 24 h post-injury. There does not appear to be any difference between the small- and medium-sized tracers in the transit times of tracer in the lung vascular compartment. The increases in extravascular water volume have been confirmed by gravimetric analyses of the lungs. Thus the pulmonary oedema in the rabbit animal model is detectable within 2 h post-injury, with a return towards normal values some time within 24 h if fluid challenged for short periods. Fluid resuscitation exacerbates the amount of oedema that developed. The onset of pulmonary oedema may therefore be earlier than previously seen clinically, and fluid resuscitation modifications may be of benefit in smoke inhalation injury.

"input: Abstract: Using succinate as a substrate, the respiratory control ratios of liver mitochondria from burned male Sprague-Dawley rats with full skin thickness burns covering 20 per cent of the body surface area were increased at 15, 30, 45 and 60 min after burn, the peak being at 30 min post-burn. A sham group acted as control. In comparison with the sham group, the specific activity of succinic dehydrogenase was slightly decreased and the activities of cytochromes b and c + c were decreased significantly 30 min after burning. All the results suggest a lack of increased metabolic activity during the early phase of burn injury.

Burn scar contractures repaired with scarred axial pattern flaps, scarred musculocutaneous flaps and scarred fasciocutaneous flaps are described.

An example of the use of scarred secondary axial pattern and musculocutaneous flaps for reconstruction of a burned ear is shown.

The majority of burns were domestic and fire was the predominant cause. The most vulnerable areas were the arms and the legs, and small children still have the highest incidence of thermal injury. As predisposing factors were of significance in several accidents, the importance of further prevention is stressed.

"input: Abstract: During the 17 years preceding March 1985, 140 patients sustained lightning injuries caused by 44 thunderbolts. Fifty patients showed evidence of current flow through their bodies. These 50 victims were classified into two groups, the first consisting of 9 victims who showed rupture of their clothes or linear superficial dermal burns along their whole bodies from head to feet, indicating the occurrence of surface flashovers. The remaining 41 patients showed no evidence of this flash effect. It is noteworthy that in the first group 5 of the 9 survived, whereas in the second group only 6 among 41 survived. The result indicates that when a flashover occurs along the whole body, the probability of survival is higher than 50 per cent. The conditions which determine death or survival were investigated experimentally, imposing artificial lightning voltage impulses on rats and developing flashovers on them. The rats survived when the voltage drop caused by flashover occurred immediately after the peak point, and the current waveform exhibited a sharp peak. In contrast, the rats were killed when the voltage drop caused by flashover was delayed by more than 20 microseconds, and the current waveform showed a blunt cone shape. It has been concluded that a fast flashover appreciably diminishes the energy dissipation within the body and consequently results in survival.

This variant of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma contains either vacuolated or eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions that squeeze the nucleus to one side of the cell. In this case, the inclusions were eosinophilic and stained positively for PAS, immunoglobulin M (IgM) heavy chain and kappa light chain. Electron microscopy showed granular electron-dense material trapped within distended loops of rough endoplasmic reticulum. Twenty-two cases of signet-ring cell lymphoma previously reported elsewhere in the body are reviewed, and their clinical significance is discussed.

"input: Abstract: Between January 1979 and June 1985, 10 patients with acute allergic interstitial nephritis were seen in a clinical nephrology service at a large regional hospital. The onset of renal failure was temporally related to the use of a drug: a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) (in four patients), cimetidine (in three), antibiotics (in two) or allopurinol (in one). The onset of renal failure was acute in three patients and insidious in seven. Two patients also exhibited marked proteinuria. Clinical features such as fever, rash, hematuria, pyuria with or without eosinophiluria, and mild to marked proteinuria had led to suspicion of the disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by renal biopsy findings of inflammatory cells, predominantly lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils. Three patients required hemodialysis; two of them received steroids as well. Steroid therapy was also used in two patients with NSAID-induced proteinuria. Renal function improved in nine patients by 35 days, but one patient continued to have slow but progressive deterioration of renal function. Acute interstitial nephritis can be distinguished from other forms of acute renal failure by heavy renal uptake of gallium 67, maximal 48 hours or more after injection. The improvement in renal function after discontinuation of the implicated drug, the characteristic histopathological findings of allergic interstitial nephritis, and the presence of eosinophils and sometimes IgE in the blood suggest a hypersensitivity reaction.

"input: Abstract: While the ambiguity of suicidal patients' stated motivations has been studied in some detail, less attention has been given to the changeability of their motivations. Twenty-six patients who had taken an overdose of paraquat, a highly lethal herbicide, were questioned about their motivation at the time of admission and 24 hours and 3, 7 and 10 days later. Although 25 patients claimed that they wished to die at the time of admission, all of the 14 surviving patients wished to live at the time of discharge from hospital. Of the 12 patients who died, 6 stated that they no longer wished to die in the last interview before their death. During the following year 3 of the 14 surviving patients killed themselves. The findings emphasize the importance of thoroughly assessing all aspects of the suicidal patient's situation in determining risks. The patient's stated intentions should be but one factor considered.

"input: Abstract: Off-road vehicles have attained growing popularity, expanding markets and increasing rates of associated injury, especially among young people. In 1984-85, 148 patients were treated at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, for injuries suffered in off-road vehicle accidents. The average age of the patients was 14 years. Soft-tissue injuries occurred in 33 patients, 21 of whom had severe injuries. There were 179 fractures in 133 patients. One patient died as a result of his injuries. The most common mechanism of injury was losing control of and tumbling from the machine. Seventeen patients were struck by their own vehicles, and 39 collided with objects such as cars, trees or people. The health care costs of these accidents are no less serious than the concerns for the appropriate legislation to protect consumers, particularly the young.

"input: Abstract: The prognostic value of marrow chromosome findings was examined in 242 patients with preleukemic myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), with emphasis on the significance of single versus multiple karyotypic changes. In both groups, the results showed that patients with multiple chromosome abnormalities in a marrow clone had a very high probability of early death, from progression to leukemia or from other complications of hematopoietic dysfunction. Conversely, in patients with a hemic clone having only one karyotypic alteration (involving a single chromosome or single translocation), survival over 2 years was only slightly reduced as compared to those without chromosome abnormality. The only single karyotypic alteration perhaps associated with a markedly shortened survival was monosomy 7. These findings suggest that the conclusions of previous studies concerning the grave consequences of chromosome alterations in preleukemia largely reflect the clinical significance of clones with multiple cytogenetic changes. Prior knowledge of the karyotypic status of preleukemic patients should be helpful in evaluating current attempts to find effective treatment for these difficult disorders.

"input: Abstract: Ninety-six patients with disseminated malignant melanoma received thrice weekly intramuscular injections of leukocyte A recombinant interferon (rIFN-alpha A, Roferon-A, Hoffmann La Roche) at doses of 12 X 10(6) U/m2 or 50 X 10(6) U/m2 with or without cimetidine as an immunorestorative agent. Four patients, two with prior chemotherapy, demonstrated either a complete response (3 months, soft tissue metastasis) or exceptionally durable response durations (months) of 29+ (soft tissue; lung lesion), 31+ (soft tissue), and 35+ (soft tissue; liver lesions). None of these patients had particularly characteristic clinical parameters. As noted previously, using chemotherapy, a small proportion of patients with advanced malignant melanoma, despite prior therapy, may achieve prolonged objective regression with rIFN-alpha A.

"input: Abstract: Between July 1973 and December 1979, 1171 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy. Of those patients, 195 had osseous metastases only. Upon initial diagnosis, 48% had osteolytic metastases; 13% had osteoblastic metastases; 38% had mixed metastases; and 1% had diffuse osteoporosis without any obvious bone destruction. The most common sites of involvement were the dorsal spine (62%), lumbosacral spine (72%), and pelvis (79%). Objective response to chemotherapy was observed in 59% of patients; complete responses were noted in 7%, and partial responses in 52%. The median survival was 28 months (range, 1-118 months). The median time lapse between the start of chemotherapy and disease progression was 14 months (range, 1-109 months). In 32 patients who responded to the treatment, chemotherapy was discontinued after 2 years, and their median duration of continued remission at 39 and 75 months after the completion of therapy. The incidence of pathological fractures was 57%; the most common sites were the spine, which sustained compression fractures, and the ribs. The incidences of hypercalcemia and spinal cord compression due to metastases were 19% and 10%, respectively.

"input: Abstract: Two patients with metastatic dysgerminoma of the ovary were treated with a combination of etoposide, bleomycin, and cisplatin at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute at Houston. Both patients achieved a complete remission. Patient 1 developed a massive recurrence in the para-aortic lymph nodes 21 months after diagnosis and treatment with right salpingo-oophorectomy alone. She received four cycles of chemotherapy and is free of disease 21 months from the start of chemotherapy. Patient 2 had Stage III dysgerminoma and a lymphangiogram positive for tumor in the para-aortic lymph nodes. After surgery she received three cycles of chemotherapy and is free of disease 20 months from the start of chemotherapy. Both complete remissions were documented with second-look laparotomy. Chemotherapy may be an alternative to radiotherapy for the treatment of metastatic dysgerminoma and should also be considered for selected patients with Stage I disease. A literature review further supports the conclusion that additional clinical trials might expand the indications for chemotherapy in patients with this disease.

"input: Abstract: Forty-three of 79 patients treated for clinically metastatic germ cell cancer survived for a median of 66 months (range, 52-83). In patients without previous chemotherapy the 5-year survival rate was 69%, whereas only 32% of patients with prior chemotherapy survived for 5 years. Limited disease, complete clinical response, histopathologically proven postchemotherapy tumor necrosis or complete resectability of a posttreatment mature teratoma indicated a favorable prognosis in patients without prior chemotherapy. Only 20% to 30% of the patients with less than a clinical complete response or with posttreatment residual malignant tumor can be salvaged by second line therapy. Posttreatment mature teratoma should be resected completely whenever possible, as this condition may lead to reactivation of the malignancy even after several years. Raynaud-like phenomena and/or gastrointestinal problems are the main long-term sequel (10%-15%) after modern multimodality treatment of advanced germ cell cancer (fertility-related problems are not considered here). In the majority of surviving patients, the lifestyle seems unaffected by the previous intensive treatment, evaluated about 5 years after discontinuation of all therapy.

"input: Abstract: Ten patients with advanced stage (TNM IIB-IVB) mycosis fungoides were treated with a combination chemotherapy program consisting of bleomycin and methotrexate weekly, doxorubicin every 3 weeks, and topical nitrogen mustard daily (BAM-M). Seven patients obtained histologically documented complete remissions ranging from 4 to 105+ months in duration. Median survival is 16.5+ months. Three patients in whom splenomegaly was detected during their staging evaluation underwent splenectomy. These three patients have had unmaintained disease-free survivals of 36+, 100+, and 105+ months. This study indicates that BAM-M is effective therapy for advanced stage mycosis fungoides and suggests that the therapeutic role of splenectomy should be evaluated further.

"input: Abstract: Cell-mediated and humoral immune responses were assessed in 50 patients with oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) and the results were compared with those of 50 patients with oral-leukoplakia, 50 oral cancer patients, and 50 normal healthy adult controls. The number of high-affinity rosette-forming cells (HARFC) was found to be significantly decreased in OSMF and oral cancer, whereas the number of total rosette-forming cells (TRFC) remained unaltered. Levels of serum IgA, IgD, and IgE were found to be elevated both in OSMF and oral cancer. Immunologic derangements were found to be more pronounced in oral cancer than in OSMF. The enumeration of HARFC along with the estimation of serum levels of IgA, IgD, and IgE indicates that OSMF can be an intermediary stage in the malignant transformation of a normal cell, and that these parameters may serve as markers for the early detection of oral cancer.

Other etiologic agents, including different bacteria, have also been identified. Three autopsy cases of hemophagocytic syndrome associated to acute tuberculous sepsis are presented. Benign histiocytic proliferation with striking hemophagocytosis was present in a disseminated, multisystemic pattern in all three cases. A relationship between systemic histiocytic proliferation and an anergic status in these patients is suggested.

"input: Abstract: A total of 422 patients with malignant lymphoma of bone who were seen at the Mayo Clinic from 1907 through 1982 were placed into four major groups based on stage of disease. There was one group with primary lymphoma of bone, one group with multifocal osseous lymphoma, and two groups with lymphoma of bone and nodal or soft tissue (or both) disease. The last-mentioned two groups were separated on the basis of time of onset of osseous lymphoma in relation to the nonosseous disease. The stage of disease was the single most important prognostic indicator of overall survival in malignant lymphoma of bone. The 5- and 10-year survival rates were, respectively, 58% and 53% for patients with primary bone lymphoma, 22% and 12.5% for patients with bone and nodal or soft tissue (or both) disease, and 42% and 35% for patients with multifocal osseous disease. Features having no significant prognostic value were sex of the patient, histologic grade of the lymphoma (according to the Working Formulation and the Kiel system), and presence of T-cell features or cleaved cells (or both). This study is not able to adequately address efficacy of treatment. In fact, treatment may be very important in outcome.

"input: Abstract: Head and neck cancer has rarely been reported to be a cause of meningeal carcinomatosis. These tumors are known more for their local invasiveness rather than distant metastasis. This would appear to preclude meningeal involvement, but close proximity to multiple cranial nerves may provide an access to the meninges. Six cases of head and neck cancer with meningeal invasion are presented. All six cases had malignant cells in their cerebrospinal fluid. Three cases had malignant cells recovered from a ventricular specimen after lumbar punctures were negative. The most common clinical finding on presentation was cranial nerve involvement. The optic nerve was involved most often with nerves VI and V the next most frequent. Headache was present in four patients and seizures occurred in two. No patient had meningismus. Our current treatment plan involves insertion of an Ommaya Reservoir and intraventricular methotrexate. Only patients whose primary head and neck tumor shows a response to systemic therapy undergo Ommaya placement. Meningeal carcinomatosis in head and neck cancer may be more prevalent than previously thought and the likely mechanism is via direct extension rather than hematogenous spread.

"input: Abstract: The serum testosterone level (STL) was determined in 84 male and 32 female patients with gastric carcinoma and in 58 male and 20 female patients with benign diseases as a control group. The STL of the male patients with carcinoma was lower (446 +/- 149 ng/dl) than that of the male control group (532 +/- 132 ng/dl) (P less than 0.001). Even 17 male patients of the early carcinoma showed lower STL (440 +/- 117 ng/dl) than the normal group (P less than 0.001). In the female patients, it was also lower (31.6 +/- 16.0 ng/dl) than in the control group (46.3 +/- 15.3 ng/dl) (P less than 0.005). The postoperative STL of the cases surviving the gastrectomy was higher than the preoperative data in 32 male patients (P less than 0.005) as well as in 12 female patients (0.025 greater than P greater than 0.01), whereas it obviously decreased in the patients who died of recurrence. Therefore, it appears that gastric carcinoma decreases the STL by some mechanism.

"input: Abstract: Serum total sialic acid (TSA) and lipid-associated sialic acid (LASA) levels have drawn considerable interest because of carbohydrate aberrations in malignant cells. The current investigation determined the TSA, LASA, total protein (TP), and TSA/TP values for 171 cancer patients with various primary sites and differing degrees of metastatic disease, 102 patients with nonmalignant diseases (pathologic controls), and 42 normal individuals. Data analysis indicated significant (p less than 0.01) increases in the mean (+/- SD) TSA and TSA/TP values in the cancer patients (78.1 +/- 19.2 mg/dl and 12.4 +/- 3.8 mg/g, respectively) and in the pathologic controls (76.0 +/- 7.5 mg/dl and 11.6 +/- 2.5 mg/g) when compared to the normal controls (67.3 +/- 7.1 mg/dl and 9.0 +/- 1.1 mg/g), and a significant decrease in the mean TP values in the cancer patients (6.4 +/- 1.1 g/dl) and pathologic controls (6.6 +/- 1.1 g/dl) when compared to normal controls (7.5 +/- 0.5 g/dl). No significant difference was observed between groups in LASA values. Further analysis of the data in patient subgroups based on the tissue involved, specific disease, or severity of the malignancy indicated that the lack of specificity of the markers was due primarily to restricted subgroups and that the sensitivity of TSA and TSA/TP increased as the malignancy became more severe. The results show that TSA/TP was the most useful of the markers tested for detecting malignancies. This marker should prove useful for monitoring malignant disease recurrence and/or progression and for evaluating the effectiveness of various therapeutic approaches.

"input: Abstract: Chondrosarcoma of the temporal bone is a rare lesion. Clinically it has been confused with multiple sclerosis, glomus jugulare tumors, meningioma, and chordomas. The cranial nerve palsies frequently observed with the tumors are related to the anatomic locations of the tumors. Thirteen patients with this entity are presented and the eleven other cases in the literature are reviewed. Histologically the tumors are low grade and exhibit myxoid features. The myxoid features must be differentiated from chordoma and chondroid chordoma. The tumor locations preclude surgical excision and conventional radiation therapy can cause unacceptable neurologic sequelae. Proton beam therapy has been effective in short-term results and appears capable of avoiding serious neurologic side effects.

"input: Abstract: Three clinicopathologic cases with a remarkable pattern of extensive diffuse subependymal periventricular spread of cerebral metastases from solid systemic cancer are reported. Two patients had a small cell carcinoma of the lung. In the third case, the histologic features of the brain metastases were consistent with a neuron-specific enolase-positive, small cell anaplastic carcinoma. Involvement of the choroid plexus and leptomeninges was moderate or absent. Intraparenchymatous nodular metastases were not found except in one case in which rare nodular superficial cortical metastases were present. The clinical data were nonspecific except for orthostatic hypotension, in one patient, which was probably due to the infiltration of the floor of the third and fourth ventricles. Results of the cerebrospinal fluid examination, available in two cases, were normal. The only diagnostic investigation was contrast-enhanced computed tomography scanning.

"input: Abstract: Multivariate analysis on an unselected patient population consisting of all 253 children treated for neuroblastoma in Denmark during 1943 to 1980 shows that stage, age, and treatment given are independent prognostic variables. Calendar year of diagnosis, sex of the patient, and site of primary tumor were not significant prognostic factors. Further analysis shows that multimodal treatment with surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, especially in patients older than 1 year of age with Stage II disease, has influenced the survival significantly. The fact that age at diagnosis and the administration of chemotherapy have independent prognostic significance can be explained by the theory that all neuroblastomas are virtually congenital; therefore, the difference in age at diagnosis largely reflects the difference in growth rates of the tumor. Thus, according to this theory, age may be a measure of the probability of micrometastases in addition to the clinical extent or stage of the disease, as it represents the duration of the disease. Additional chemotherapy may thus have eradicated these micrometastases in the older children, since the age influence on Stage II disease disappeared when multimodal treatment was given in this study. The implications for treatment policy are discussed in view of this theory.

"input: Abstract: The occurrence of breast cancer in two related males, an uncle and nephew is reported. A review of previously reported cases of male breast cancer occurring in families and the association with other cancers in other family members is included. In previous reports on breast cancer in males, familial or hereditary factors have not generally been recognized as a major contributing factor. Of ten families reported (including our own) where there is sufficient information given, six families (60%) had females with breast cancer. It appears there are some families in which males as well as females have an increased risk of developing breast cancer.

"input: Abstract: Many patients with diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma have dyspnea or chest pain. Cardiac symptomatology is frequently difficult to differentiate from symptoms of pleuropulmonary disease. To better define the clinical characteristics of cardiac involvement in patients with mesothelioma, the electrocardiographic (EKG) and echocardiographic findings in 64 patients with biopsy-proven malignant pleural mesothelioma were reviewed. A total of 19/64 (30%) patients had autopsy studies available for review. The EKG was abnormal in 55 patients (89%). Over half (60%) had an arrhythmia, including sinus tachycardia (42%), premature atrial and ventricular contractions (13%), atrial fibrillation (3%), and atrial flutter (1%). Over one third (37%) had a conduction abnormality, including bundle branch block (13%), hemiblock (8.5%), and incomplete right bundle branch block (13%). Echocardiography revealed a total of 13 patients with pericardial effusions, two with pericardial thickening, and one with an anterior sonolucent space. Of 19 autopsies, cardiac invasion was found in 14 (74%), with more than half to the pericardium and more than one quarter to the myocardium. It is concluded that: clinical cardiac abnormalities occur in the great majority of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, pathologic cardiac invasion occurs in the great majority of patients with pleural mesothelioma, and the EKG and echocardiogram are helpful in differentiating cardiac involvement from progressive pulmonary disease in patients with pleural mesothelioma.

"input: Abstract: Simultaneous urinary flow cytometry, cytologic, and cystoscopic examinations were performed at 3-month intervals for a minimum of 1 year on 29 patients receiving intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) treatment of superficial bladder carcinoma. Flow cytometry (FCM) and cytology were concordant in 57 of 103 examinations; both FCM and cytology were positive in 38 instances, and carcinoma was confirmed by biopsy in 35 (92.1%). In 16 instances FCM and cytology were negative, but carcinoma was present on biopsy in 5 (31.3%). Three examinations were suspicious by both techniques. The 46 determinations with discordant FCM and cytology were subdivided into pathologically confirmed recurrences (25 instances) and no evidence of pathologic and/or cystoscopic disease (21 instances). In the 25 instances of recurrences, FCM was positive in 18 (72.0%), suspicious in 3 (12.0%), and negative in 4 (16.0%), while cytology was positive in 3 (12.0%), suspicious in 9 (36.0%), and negative in 13 (52.0%). Most patients had a severe BCG-induced inflammatory response that caused an elevation of the hyperdiploid population, believed secondary to epithelial regeneration and proliferation. In the 21 instances without detectable recurrence, hyperploidy led to a relatively high proportion of positive (15) and suspicious (4) results by FCM, but only eight had distinct aneuploid populations. It is possible that this latter group, at least, is harboring occult carcinoma. Conventional cytology in the nonrecurrent group was positive in 1 (4.8%), suspicious in 7 (33.3%), and negative in 13 (61.9%). In those instances when tumor was confirmed by biopsy, the false-negative rate for FCM was 19.7%; the false-negative rate for cytology was 40.9%. Thus, FCM appears to be more sensitive but less specific than conventional cytology, having a lower false-negative but a higher false-positive rate. Although serial FCM provides an objective quantitative measure of aneuploid stemlines and hyperdiploid populations in bladder irrigation specimens and can be helpful in following intravesical BCG therapy for superficial bladder carcinoma, it should still be used with conventional cytology. The greatest difficulty with FCM at present, as with conventional cytology, is in cases of marked inflammation. The results reported here were obtained under the most stringent conditions and represent the minimum level of accuracy. Potential improvements in the technique, with the addition of immunologic or other markers, hold hope of further increasing the accuracy of FCM.

"input: Abstract: The effects of preoperative irradiation on the morphology of transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) were evaluated by studying the pretreatment biopsy and radical cystectomy specimens from 35 patients. Twenty-six of these patients had received 2000 rad within the week preceding surgery, and nine patients had received no preoperative treatment. The frequency of bladders without residual TCC was 23% for irradiated and 22% for nonirradiated cases. Of the TCCs classified as papillary in the biopsy specimens and irradiated, 79% lacked a papillary component at cystectomy, but in no case was the invasive component eliminated or regression from muscle invasion to superficial TCC noticed. Flat carcinoma in situ (CIS) did not respond to irradiation. At cystectomy nuclear pleomorphism was greater than at biopsy in 60% of the irradiated TCCs, whereas all nonirradiated cases retained the same grade as at biopsy. In addition, irradiation induced squamous differentiation in neoplastic cells only, without affecting the nonneoplastic urothelium.

"input: Abstract: A considerable amount of literature has been devoted to compromise of the right ventricle in spontaneous myocardial infarction. Little information is available regarding disproportionate dysfunction of the right ventricle associated with cardiac operation and the recovery period therefrom. Recognition of the problem is of paramount importance, if support measures are to be implemented. A great deal has yet to be learned regarding the appropriate support for the acutely failing right ventricle. Much remains to be accomplished regarding the assessment of right ventricle reserve, defining the role of risk factors, and quantitating the value of measures to optimally protect the right ventricle from injury during the perioperative period. Recognizing that the integrity of the right ventricle can be altered by numerous preoperative, perioperative and postoperative factors will provide an enlightened disposition on the part of the surgical team. Awareness of these considerations in the planning and conduct of surgical procedures should reduce morbidity and mortality from perioperative right ventricular failure. The imposition of new or unexpected morbidity during operation on a relatively unrelated problem represents surgical imperfection. Appropriate effort toward minimizing insult of the right ventricle could result in significantly decreasing the incidence and severity of perioperative right ventricular failure before the impetus of the continuing clinical problem dictates improvement in techniques to more appropriately treat this frequently preventable problem.

"input: Abstract: The cross-sectional relationship of endogenous androgens (testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate [DHEA-S]), estrogen (estradiol) and progestin (progesterone) to serum levels of lipoprotein cholesterol (very low-density [VLDL], low-density [LDL], and high-density lipoprotein [HDL]) and apolipoproteins (apo A-I and apo B) were studied in white (n = 251) and black (n = 258) adolescent boys, ages 11 to 17 years, as part of the Bogalusa Heart Study. Black boys had significantly higher levels of estradiol, HDL cholesterol, and apo A-I, and lower levels of androstenedione and VLDL cholesterol than white boys, independent of age and adiposity. Age was correlated strongly with testosterone and androstenedione, and moderately with DHEA-S and estradiol levels in both races. However, only in white boys was age consistently related to VLDL cholesterol (positively), HDL cholesterol (negatively), and apo A-I (negatively). Overall, testosterone was associated inversely with HDL cholesterol and apo A-I in white boys, while progesterone was related positively to apo A-I in both races after adjusting for age and adiposity. However, these relationships were found to differ with age. Partial correlations between levels of sex hormones and lipoproteins adjusted for age and adiposity showed no associations in the 11 to 12 year age group in boys of either race. A significant positive relation of testosterone to VLDL cholesterol, and inverse relations of testosterone to HDL cholesterol and apo A-I and DHEA-S to HDL cholesterol were apparent only in white boys in the 13 to 14 year age group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

"input: Abstract: Atrial pacing was performed in 16 patients with angina at rest and significant coronary artery stenosis (greater than 70%) over 2 consecutive days in the morning (10 A.M. to 1 P.M.), in the afternoon (4 to 7 P.M.), and at night (12 midnight to 3 A.M.) to assess possible circadian variations of their ischemic threshold. Overall, the incidence of resting angina was highest at night. All pacing results were positive (greater than or equal to 1.0 mm ST segment shift) and tended to be reproducible in nine patients, whereas some or all were negative in seven. Among all positive results, ischemic thresholds at night were significantly lower than those in the morning and in the afternoon (125 +/- 3 vs 138 +/- 3 and 139 +/- 2 beats/min, mean +/- SEM; p less than .005). In nine patients, 19 pacing tests produced ST segment elevation, of which 13 were performed at night (68%). We conclude that patients with resting angina and severe coronary stenosis often exhibit a nocturnal decline in their ischemic threshold, which seems to facilitate development of transmural ischemia during atrial pacing.

"input: Abstract: It has been shown in different groups of patients with variant angina that coronary spasm can be reproduced by physiologic maneuvers and pharmacologic agents. It is not known, however, to what extent different stimuli can induce spasm in the same patient. To investigate whether coronary arterial spasm results from specific abnormal agonist-receptor interactions or from a local nonspecific coronary supersensitivity to different stimuli, 28 patients with vasospastic angina were submitted to a series of diverse vasoconstrictive stimuli known to provoke coronary spasm. Ergonovine, hyperventilation, handgrip, cold pressor, and exercise-tests, were carried out in all 28 patients. In the last 15 patients histamine was also administered. Spasm was provoked by ergonovine in 96% of patients, by hyperventilation in 54%, by histamine in 47%, by exercise in 46%, and by the cold pressor and handgrip tests in 11% and 7%, respectively. No significant differences were found in the responses to provocative tests of patients with normal coronary arteries or nonsignificant stenoses and those with significant lesions. In the same individual, spasm was induced by at least two vasoconstrictive stimuli, although with a different mechanism of action, in 82% of patients and spasm was induced by three or more stimuli in 39%. Tests were repeated in at least 23 patients and short-term reproducibility paralleled sensitivity. These results suggest that in patients with variant angina, a local nonspecific supersensitivity rather than an abnormal specific agonist-receptor interaction plays a major role in the genesis of coronary arterial spasm.

"input: Abstract: The risk of developing spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (VT) and/or sudden death (""arrhythmic events"") was prospectively assessed in 165 patients who survived acute myocardial infarction. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms (ECGs) were performed before hospital discharge and then serially at regular intervals over the following year. In addition, 24 hr Holter monitoring was performed and left ventricular ejection fraction was determined. Sixty-five patients (group 1) had abnormal signal-averaged ECGs (voltage in the last 40 msec of the filtered QRS less than 20 microV or filtered QRS duration greater than 120 msec), 92 had normal signal-averaged ECGs (group 2), and eight had bundle branch block (excluded from analysis). In group 1, spontaneous normalization of the voltage in the last 40 msec of the QRS complex occurred in 30% of patients after 12 months, although total filtered QRS duration did not change overall. During follow-up of up to 20 months (median 11), seven patients died suddenly and six presented again with spontaneous, symptomatic VT. Eleven of 65 (17%) group 1 patients had an arrhythmic event compared with one of 92 patients (1%) in group 2 (p less than .001). The sensitivity of the signal-averaged ECG as a predictor of arrhythmic events was 92% with a specificity of 62%. Patients with subsequent arrhythmic events had considerably lower voltage in the last 40 msec of the QRS (11.0 +/- 8.3 vs 32.0 +/- 21.9 microV; p less than .001) than those without such events, and longer filtered QRS complexes (121 +/- 14 vs 105 +/- 12 msec; p less than .001). Multivariate logistic regression determined that the signal-averaged ECG provided independent prognostic information from the presence of complex ventricular ectopy and the degree of left ventricular dysfunction assessed at the time of hospital discharge. Signal-averaged ECGs provide important prognostic information in identifying patients at risk of arrhythmic events after myocardial infarction. Dynamic changes in the terminal QRS voltage are observed during the first year after myocardial infarction.

"input: Abstract: We developed methods for identifying beta-adrenergic receptors in human right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy tissue with the radioligand (-)[125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP). Specific ICYP binding in a crude, high-yield membrane preparation derived from endomyocardial biopsy tissue was high (specificity greater than 90%), of high affinity (KD around 20 pM), saturable and stereospecific for the (-) vs the (+) isomer of isoproterenol. Subjects with mild-moderate and severe biventricular dysfunction had respective decreases in beta-adrenergic receptor density of 38.2% and 57.7% when normalization methods were averaged, with no significant differences in ICYP dissociation constant. A subgroup of subjects was subdivided by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) into those with mild cardiac dysfunction (LVEF less than 0.50 greater than 0.40) and severe heart failure (LVEF less than 0.20) and given graded sequential infusions of dobutamine and calcium gluconate. Those with severe cardiac dysfunction had marked impairment of the dobutamine dP/dt and stroke work index response, whereas these responses to calcium did not differ in the two groups. These data indicate that in the intact human heart endomyocardial biopsy may be used for direct analysis of beta-adrenergic receptors, heart failure-associated myocardial beta-adrenergic down-regulation begins with mild-moderate ventricular dysfunction, reduction in myocardial beta-receptor density is related to degree of heart failure, and beta-receptor down-regulation is associated with pharmacologically specific impairment of the beta-agonist-mediated contractile response.

"input: Abstract: Combined two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography has a high sensitivity and specificity for detection of isolated perimembranous ventricular septal defects. However, muscular or multiple ventricular septal defects may be difficult to diagnose with noninvasive methods, particularly in older children, necessitating angiography for accurate diagnosis. Detection of single and multiple ventricular septal defects with two-dimensional color flow mapping was compared with detection by standard two-dimensional imaging and Doppler. Both techniques were compared with four-chamber left ventricular angiography. Fifty-one patients (age 3 months to 25 years, mean 5.6 years) were studied. Eighteen had solitary ventricular septal defects, 18 had multiple ventricular septal defects, and 15 patients with intact ventricular septum served as a control group. At least one ventricular septal defect was detected by color Doppler and two-dimensional/Doppler methods in all patients with ventricular septal defect proved by angiography with no false positives. In the detection of multiple ventricular septal defects, the sensitivity of color Doppler was 72% and that of two-dimensional/Doppler was 38% (100% specificity in both). Color Doppler failed to identify multiple ventricular septal defects in five patients (two weighing less than 4 kg and three with reduced pulmonary blood flow). However, no large additional muscular defects were missed by imaging and color Doppler. Color Doppler is useful for the detection of ventricular septal defects and has higher sensitivity than two-dimensional/Doppler for multiple ventricular septal defects. The contribution of color Doppler appears to be in the detection of additional small muscular ventricular septal defects.

"input: Abstract: Low-level activity at the end of the QRS complex was analyzed from 63 thoracic leads in 15 normal subjects and in 21 patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT). The latter had old myocardial infarction and no conduction disturbances and had not been receiving antiarrhythmic drugs. In both normal subjects and patients with VT, isopotential maps of the time-averaged and filtered (25 Hz high-pass) electrocardiograms during the terminal portion of the QRS were dipolar, i.e., they showed single positive and negative regions. For patients with VT, the extrema were either distant, with one over the precordial area and the other over the back, or close together in the precordial region. In 10 patients, maps recorded after administration of antiarrhythmic drugs remained the same while QRS duration was prolonged. In six patients, maps recorded before antiarrhythmic surgery showed distant extrema for septal or posterobasal VT sites of origin and close extrema for anterior or posteroapical sites. Generally, QRS duration was reduced and maps were modified after surgery. Late potentials can be well detected with only three orthogonal leads because their distributions are dipolar, but maps provide additional information about their distribution, which may be related to conduction delay sites and possibly to VT sites of origin. Sources near the torso surface would produce close extrema, whereas deeper sources would produce distant extrema.

"input: Abstract: Body surface potential maps were recorded from 140 chest leads in 25 patients affected by the idiopathic long QT syndrome (LQTS) and in 25 healthy control subjects matched for age and sex. Potential time integrals of the QRST and ST-T intervals were calculated at each lead point and displayed as isointegral (ISOI) maps. The main abnormalities noted on the QRST and ST-T ISOI maps were one area of negative values larger than normal in the right anterior and inferior thorax and a complex multipeak distribution of the integral values. At least one abnormality was present in 19 (76%) of the patients with LQTS and four (16%) of the control subjects (p less than .001). Each ISOI map was also represented as a weighted sum of nine fundamental components (eigenvectors) to detect and quantitate the nondipolar content. The percent contribution of the nondipolar eigenvectors (all eigenvectors beyond the third) was significantly higher in the LQTS group than in the control group (p less than .005). Specifically, an abnormally high nondipolar content on the QRST ISOI maps was observed much more frequently for patients with LQTS than for control subjects (nine or 36% vs one or 4%), and this was also true on the ST-T ISOI maps (14 or 56% vs one or 4%). No correlation was found between the major abnormalities on body surface maps and syncopal episodes. However, the high prevalence (76%) of these alterations among the patients with LQTS and their infrequent occurrence in the control population strongly suggests that they may be useful markers for the diagnosis of atypical cases. The prominent electronegative area on the anterior thorax can be related to delayed repolarization of a portion of the anterior wall of the heart. This finding is in agreement with the hypothesis that lower than normal right cardiac sympathetic activity is the main pathogenetic mechanism of LQTS. Multipeak distribution and high nondipolar content suggest regional electrical disparities in the ventricular recovery process. This may in part account for the high susceptibility of patients with LQTS to malignant arrhythmias.

"input: Abstract: The short-term effects of incremental doses of procainamide (7.5, 15, 22.5, and 30 mg/kg) on right ventricular effective refractory period, intraventricular conduction, and induction of ventricular tachycardia were determined in 31 patients who had a history of sustained, unimorphic ventricular tachycardia. QRS duration during incremental ventricular pacing was used as an index of rate-dependent changes in intraventricular conduction. The mean plasma procainamide concentrations corresponding to the incremental doses were 5.5 +/- 1.2 (+/- SD), 9.0 +/- 1.6, 12.6 +/- 2.2, and 16.3 +/- 3.2 mg/liter. Each incremental dose of procainamide up to a dose of 30 mg/kg resulted in a significant increment in right ventricular effective refractory period and each dose up to 22.5 mg/kg potentiated a rate-dependent prolongation of QRS duration. After the 7.5 mg/kg dose of procainamide, induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed in eight of 31 patients. After higher doses of procainamide, induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed in two additional patients. In three of 10 patients in whom the induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed by 7.5, 15, or 22.5 mg/kg of procainamide, sustained unimorphic ventricular tachycardia was again inducible after a higher dose of procainamide. In three of 31 patients, only nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was inducible after a 7.5 to 22.5 mg/kg dose of procainamide; however, in two of these three patients, sustained ventricular tachycardia was again inducible after administration of a higher dose of procainamide. In conclusion, during electropharmacologic testing with procainamide, it is worthwhile to test a dose of 7.5 mg/kg, because this dose is often effective in patients who respond to this drug. However, the results of this study indicate that procainamide may be effective in suppressing the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia at a relatively low plasma concentration, but not at a higher plasma concentration. Therefore, during long-term therapy with procainamide it may be important to avoid plasma procainamide concentrations not only lower, but also higher than the concentration that results in the suppression of induction of tachycardia.

"input: Abstract: Coronary dissection and total coronary occlusion leading to emergency coronary surgery are the most frequent complications of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and their occurrence usually is unpredictable. To identify angiographic characteristics of coronary stenoses that may affect the incidence of these complications, the diagnostic pre-PTCA coronary angiograms of 38 consecutive patients (group I) undergoing emergency coronary surgery for dissection or occlusion were reviewed and compared with the angiograms of a random sample of 38 patients (stratified for left anterior descending and right coronary arteries) from a group of 1151 who did not need emergency coronary surgery (group II). Stenosis morphology before angioplasty was considered ""complicated"" if at least one of the following criteria was present: irregular borders, intraluminal lucency, and localization of stenosis in curve or at bifurcation. Baseline characteristics, maximum inflation pressures, types of balloon catheters used, and routinely registered angiographic stenosis properties (severity, length, eccentricity, and calcification) were similar in both groups. Irregular borders before PTCA were present in 22 of 38 patients in group I vs 10 of 38 in group II (p less than .05), intraluminal lucency in 22 of 38 vs nine of 38 (p less than .05), localization in curve in 27 of 38 pts vs 16 of 38 (p less than .05), and localization at bifurcation in 11 of 38 vs 15 of 38 (NS). Complicated angiographic morphology of coronary stenosis may represent a risk factor for dissection or occlusion. Therefore, although the predictive value of these findings is low, detailed evaluation of angiographic morphology of coronary stenoses may improve patient selection and reduce complication rates of PTCA.

"input: Abstract: The effect of thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction on enzymatic infarct size, left ventricular function, and early mortality was studied in subsets of patients in a randomized trial. Early thrombolytic therapy with intracoronary streptokinase (152 patients) or with intracoronary streptokinase preceded by intravenous streptokinase (117 patients) was compared with conventional treatment (264 patients). All 533 patients were admitted to the coronary care unit within 4 hr after onset of symptoms indicative of acute myocardial infarction. Four hundred eighty-eight patients were eligible for this detailed analysis, and 245 of these were allocated to thrombolytic therapy and 243 to conventional treatment. Early angiographic examinations were performed in 212 patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy. Patency of the infarct-related artery was achieved in 181 patients (85%). Enzymatic infarct size, as measured from cumulative alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase release, was smaller in patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy (median 760 vs 1170 U/liter in control patients, p = .0001). Left ventricular ejection fraction measured by radionuclide angiography before discharge from the hospital was higher after thrombolytic therapy (median 50% vs 43% in control patients, p = .0001). Three month mortality was lower in patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy (6% vs 14% in the control group, p = .006). With the use of multivariate regression analysis, infarct size limitation, improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction, and three month mortality were predicted by sum of the ST segment elevation, time from onset of symptoms to admission, and Killip class at admission. Thrombolysis was most effective in patients admitted within 2 hr after onset of symptoms and in patients with a sum of ST segment elevation of 1.2 mV or more. On the other hand, no beneficial effects of streptokinase on enzymatic infarct size, left ventricular function, or mortality were observed in the subset of patients with a sum of ST segment elevation of less than 1.2 mV who were admitted between 2 and 4 hr after onset of symptoms.

"input: Abstract: Myocardial and cerebral blood flow can be generated during cardiac arrest by techniques that manipulate intrathoracic pressure. Augmentation of intrathoracic pressure by high-pressure ventilation simultaneous with compression of the chest in dogs has been shown to produce higher flows to the heart and brain, but has limited usefulness because of the requirement for endotracheal intubation and complex devices. A system was developed that can produce high intrathoracic pressure without simultaneous ventilation by use of a pneumatically cycled vest placed around the thorax (vest cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR]). The system was first tested in a short-term study of the maximum achievable flows during arrest. Peak vest pressures up to 380 mm Hg were used on eight 21 to 30 kg dogs after induction of ventricular fibrillation and administration of epinephrine. Microsphere-determined myocardial blood flow was 108 +/- 17 ml/min/100 g (100 +/- 16% of prearrest flow) and cerebral flow was 51 +/- 12 ml/min/100 g (165 +/- 39% of prearrest). Severe lung or liver trauma was noted in three of eight dogs. If peak vest pressure was limited to 280 mm Hg, however, severe trauma was no longer observed. A study of the hemodynamics during and survival from prolonged resuscitation was then performed on three groups of seven dogs. Vest CPR was compared with manual CPR with either conventional (300 newtons) or high (430 newtons) sternal force. After induction of ventricular fibrillation, each technique was performed for 26 min. Defibrillation was then performed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

"input: Abstract: To determine the importance of reperfusion injury and the ability of the free-radical scavenger recombinant human superoxide dismutase (h-SOD) to prevent it, open-chest dogs underwent 90 min of proximal circumflex coronary artery occlusion, and only at the moment of reperfusion received either h-SOD (400,000 IU bolus into the left atrium followed by a 300,000 IU iv infusion over 1 hr) or saline. After 48 hr the surviving animals were killed and measurements were made of the risk region (by postmortem angiography) and infarct size (by gross pathology). All measurements were made by investigators blinded to treatment given, and the code was broken only at the end of the study. Hemodynamic variables and collateral flow during ischemia were similar in the two groups. Infarct size in control animals (n = 8) averaged 22.4 +/- 3.1% of the left ventricle and 52.2 +/- 7.1% of the risk region, compared with 13.3 +/- 0.8% of the left ventricle and 33.6 +/- 2.1% of the risk region in h-SOD-treated dogs (n = 8) (p less than .05). Infarcts in treated animals were not only smaller, but also exhibited a distinctive ""patchiness,"" suggesting protection along vascular distributions. Furthermore, analysis of the relationship between infarct size and collateral flow measured during ischemia in the two groups indicated that protection by h-SOD was greatest in animals with the lowest collateral flows. This study supports the concept that reperfusion of ischemic myocardium results in a separate component of cell damage, presumably linked to the generation of oxygen free radicals on reflow. Since the h-SOD preventable reperfusion component of injury was most pronounced in hearts with the most severe ischemia, scavenging of oxygen radicals at the time of reflow may offer a novel and particularly promising therapeutic approach for the protection of ischemic myocardium.

"input: Abstract: We examined the effects of a paramagnetic contrast agent, gadolinium diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) on magnetic resonance images of acute myocardial infarction with and without reperfusion. Twenty-two dogs underwent occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). In 10 dogs (group I) the LAD remained occluded for 3 hr and in the other 12 (group II) for 2 hr followed by 1 hr of reperfusion. Gd-DTPA (0.34 mM/kg) was administered to five dogs in group I at 2 hr and 5 min after occlusion and to seven dogs in group II 5 min after reperfusion. At 3 hr after ligation, the hearts were excised and imaged with spin echo and inversion recovery pulse sequences on a 0.35 Tesla magnetic resonance imager. Reperfused hearts given Gd-DTPA demonstrated a significant increase in contrast between normal and reperfused myocardium as compared with nonreperfused hearts and reperfused hearts not given Gd-DTPA. This enhancement was particularly prominent in the inversion recovery images. Studies performed in vivo in two additional dogs demonstrated similar enhancement with reperfusion with Gd-DTPA in gated spin echo images. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging allows the detection of reperfusion early in the course of acute infarction.

The event that compromises the cardiac status is often respiratory embarrassment, and the presenting rhythms are often bradyarrhythmias and asystole. Emergency medical services (EMS) systems have primarily an adult focus and may not be organized to manage optimally the critically ill and injured child. Data from a survey of training programs demonstrate that paramedic and EMT education in pediatric emergencies may be inadequate. Forty-one percent of the programs surveyed had less than 10 hr of pediatric training. Data suggest that EMS providers may not be equipped to manage children effectively. The Los Angeles EMS System for children is described. There are two levels of receiving facilities: Emergency Departments Approved for Pediatrics and Pediatric Critical Care Centers. The system is voluntary and has 85% of the hospitals in compliance with the guidelines. Early recognition of the prearrest state, improved training, and equipping of prehospital care personnel, development of EMS services for children, dissemination of an advanced pediatric life support course, as well as research in pediatric CPR may improve the outcome of resuscitation in the pediatric population.

"input: Abstract: Defibrillation by minimally trained ambulance technicians can significantly improve survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in communities of all sizes. However, special consideration must be given to the development of such services in small communities, chiefly because of problems associated with the low volume of true emergency calls. Communities considering implementing programs by which defibrillation is performed by the emergency medical technician (EMT-D) must first evaluate their ambulance response times and, if inadequate, alter their system of ambulance response. After implementation of such a program, a permanent, formal skill maintenance program must be established. Defibrillation protocols must allow for the fact that many patients will refibrillate after successful conversion, yet no advanced care beyond the defibrillator will generally be available. Finally, every community instituting an EMT-D program must maintain a system of monitoring EMT performance and patient outcome that documents acceptable survival-to-discharge rates as well as the safety of the program. For smaller communities a regional or statewide evaluation system may be preferable to individual community programs.

"input: Abstract: To increase the survival rate for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, improvements in training must be made so that lay rescuers are motivated and have the ability to get involved. To overcome some of the fear and lack of involvement, better education strategies are needed. Adults learn didactic information through understanding and skills through repetition and reinforcement. Due to the fact that there is limited time that adults will commit to learning CPR, methods of simplification of the techniques need to be used so that there can be sufficient repetition and reinforcement. Teaching two-rescuer CPR to lay rescuers should not routinely be done. Most adults, particularly those around high-risk individuals, should learn one-rescuer CPR. Infant resuscitation should be taught predominantly to those around small children. Methods of reinforcement through the mass media should be attempted on a routine basis. Whenever possible the courses should be spread over a period of time to allow for repetition and reinforcement, thereby maximizing learning. Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) should be widely taught to health professionals. ACLS instruction needs to be spread over time, whenever logistically possible, to enhance learning and retention. Good, validated examinations are needed and should be routinely rotated. Better methods of evaluation are needed to look at the benefit of these types of programs and to improve the cost-benefit ratio.

"input: Abstract: The ability of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to provide adequate vital organ blood flow during prolonged resuscitation has long been questioned, as has the mechanism of blood flow during CPR. Because coughing during cardiac arrest has been shown to produce adequate anterograde flow to maintain consciousness in man without compressing the heart, cough CPR has been used as a model of a pure ""thoracic pump"" mechanism on which to base modifications of CPR. In the thoracic pump mechanism, the left heart is a passive conduit for blood expressed from the pulmonary vasculature to the aorta, and there is selective flow to the brachiocephalic vascular bed because of its low pressure veins, which are protected by closure of thoracic inlet venous valves. Right heart flow from systemic veins to the lungs occurs between applications of pressure. Four alternative modalities exploiting the thoracic pump concept were studied in dogs during ventricular fibrillation with angiographic and pressure recordings: cough CPR, simultaneous chest compression and lung inflation, abdominal compression with lung inflation, and inflation of a vest and binder. The latter technique was associated with successful defibrillation and recovery after more than 30 min of circulatory support during ventricular fibrillation. Preliminary studies in a primate preparation indicate that this technique might be useful for prolonged circulatory support in man when defibrillation is not initially available or successful.

"input: Abstract: Considerable effort has been expended in recent years by a number of laboratories to improve methods of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This article briefly summarizes 5 years of investigation by our group on hemodynamic support during external cardiac massage. In most studies, long-term canine preparations were used, and implanted transducers allowed precise hemodynamic measurements. Although cardiac output was depressed with all CPR methods, manual chest compressions of high velocity, moderate force, and brief duration at a rate of 120/min seemed to optimize systemic and coronary blood flow. This method was termed high-impulse CPR. High-impulse techniques now have been applied extensively in the clinical setting, and preliminary observations also support their efficacy in man. Based on this experience, it is suggested that the American Heart Association guidelines be changed to recommend a manual chest compression rate of 120/min during closed-chest cardiac massage.

"input: Abstract: Management of foreign body airway obstruction continues to be a major controversy in emergency medical care. Much of the disagreement is without doubt based on lack of a uniformly accepted model of acute airway obstruction representative of the clinical event. A variety of models have been used to assess different aspects of airway obstruction by foreign bodies. These models have analyzed, among other variables, kinetic energy and inertial and aerodynamic forces in attempts to focus on specific aspects of this controversy. Human volunteers, anesthetized and paralyzed patients, and cadavers have also been used. In several recent studies it was concluded that subdiaphragmatic pressure is the treatment of choice, while in at least one additional study firm back blows applied with the patient's head hanging downward were recommended as the treatment most likely to relieve airway obstruction. It seems likely that these apparently conflicting views can be reconciled and that a consensus recommendation for treatment of this emergency can be effected.

"input: Abstract: To determine the value of sodium bicarbonate in resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation and the prevention of spontaneous refibrillation, sodium bicarbonate (1 meq/kg) or placebo was administered on a random basis to 16 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs 18 min after the induction of ventricular fibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Defibrillation was attempted 2 min after the administration of bicarbonate or placebo. All animals were successfully defibrillated, but three of eight bicarbonate-treated and two of eight control animals died in electromechanical dissociation (p = NS). Spontaneous refibrillation occurred in three animals in each group (p = NS). Successful resuscitation was not dependent on treatment, arterial or mixed venous Pco2, or arterial or mixed venous pH but correlated strongly with coronary perfusion pressure (p less than .003). Spontaneous refibrillation occurred without relation to any identifiable variable. The gradient between diastolic aortic and right atrial pressures was 24 +/- 2 mm Hg in controls and 23 +/- 2 mm Hg in treated animals over the entire 20 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (p = NS). However, among animals successfully resuscitated, mean diastolic coronary perfusion pressure averaged 27 +/- 2 mm Hg compared with 20 +/- 1 mm Hg among those dying in electromechanical dissociation (p less than .02). For the final 2 min of resuscitation, after drug administration, these gradients were 31 +/- 2 and 23 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively (p less than .01). Microsphere determined myocardial perfusion correlated with the diastolic aortic-right atrial perfusion pressure gradient (r = .86) and was 0.43 +/- 0.03 ml/min/g in survivors and 0.22 +/- 0.01 ml/min/g in nonsurvivors (p less than .01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

"input: Abstract: There has been concern that the smoking of tobacco can adversely affect the health of non-smokers. This is most cogent in children who are subject to smoke at home. The aim of this study is to relate children's sore throats to the smoking habits of their parents. The parents of 154 children were asked about the age, sex, birthweight, method of postnatal feeding and age at starting school or day nursery of the child, the frequency of sore throats, smoking habits and history of tonsillectomy of all members of the household, the size of family, the dwelling size, and the occupation of the father. Analysis by multiple regression showed a significant association between children's sore throats and maternal smoking. Reduction in domestic cigarette smoke exposure should benefit the child by reducing the number of sore throats he or she suffers.

"input: Abstract: A prospective bacteriological and symptomatic study was carried out on 50 swimmers and 50 non-swimmers who had grommets inserted for secretory otitis media. The risk of developing otorrhoea with positive bacterial pathogens was similar for swimmers (7.9%) and non-swimmers (8.0%). Subdividing the non-swimmers into 'wetters' and 'strictly dry' there was a similar risk of ear symptoms and pathogens. All children who swim before the insertion of grommets should continue to do so postoperatively with no added risk of ear infections.

"input: Abstract: The relationship between air flow at 38 degrees C and area colour change on a flexible liquid crystal film was found to be virtually linear between the values of 1 and 31 min-1 cm-2. This value of flow per unit area corresponded to values expected at the level of the nostril during quiet breathing. A series of 6 subjects were asked to breathe over a flexible liquid crystal film regularly during the day and the area of colour change produced by flow from each nostril was examined. Four subjects showed a regular change in relative flow through each nostril whilst 2 subjects showed a constant flow through each nostril. This simple and non-invasive technique provides a method of examining the nasal cycle in adults and children in health and disease.

"input: Abstract: Twelve human laryngeal carcinomas and 14 normal vocal cord epithelia were studied in vitro by the method of tissue culture incorporating video time-lapse microscopy. Different events were photographed by taking 'stills' from the television monitor during play-back. Outgrowths from both tumour and normal explants formed only as monolayers. Mitoses were mainly found to be localized approximately mid-way between explant and the edge of the outgrowth. Some cells were seen to become suddenly active producing oscillating blebs and sometimes they detached themselves from the monolayer culture and changed appearance. This was more prevalent in the tumour cultures. In both tumour and normal cell cultures lymphocytes were observed and their normal chemokinetic movement was changed into a rapid chemotactic attraction by the presence of a mitotic epithelial cell. These lymphocytes appear to represent T-suppressor cells. The present study has shown that primary tissue culture can be a valuable tool in the study of laryngeal carcinoma. The interaction between mitotic tumour cells and lymphocytes may represent a transformation of T-lymphocytes into LAK cells.

"input: Abstract: DNA measurements yield information about the nature of cells and may provide diagnostic and prognostic information. Static cytofluorometry was performed on smears removed at microlaryngoscopy from 107 vocal cord lesions (96 patients). All stem cell lines were diploid except 3; 2 carcinomas and 1 severe dysplasia were polyploid. The mean proliferative activity (percentage of nuclei greater than diploid peak) was 2.1% for the group of epithelia with hyperplasia and mild dysplasia, 3.1% for those with moderate dysplasia, 4.0% for severe dysplasia, and 6.8% for carcinomas. Hypertetraploid cell nuclei (HT cells) were not found in epithelia with hyperplasia and mild dysplasia. Seven out of 15 patients with epithelia showing moderate dysplasia had HT cells; 5 of these patients developed a carcinoma. One of 8 without HT cells developed a severe dysplasia. Nine patients with severe dysplasia had HT cells; 4 had recurrences and 4 developed carcinoma within 4 years. In 14 patients without HT cells, 3 had recurrences and 1 developed a carcinoma 6 years later. HT cells were found in 15 patients with T1 & T2 carcinomas; residual carcinoma was present in 2 after radiotherapy and 4 had recurrences within 11 months. Fourteen patients with T1 & T2 carcinoma did not have any HT cells; one had residual carcinoma after radiotherapy and 3 had recurrences between 18 months and 4 years. DNA measurements and, especially, the demonstration of epithelia with HT cells prove to be of prognostic importance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

"input: Abstract: Twenty-two patients with recurrent nose bleeds and varicose vessels on the nasal septum were subjected to transection of the vessels and followed-up for 2 years. One month after the operation, it was not possible to identify the original vessels. In other locations new varicose vessels began to appear after 1 month, and at the end of the follow-up period were observed on 9 out of 10 operated sides. The transection resulted in an immediate decrease in the frequency of nose bleeds and at the end of the control period 12 (55%) of the patients had had less than 4 bleeds during the previous year in spite of the observed rapid formation of new vessels. Mucosal atrophy with symptoms of increased nasal crusting occurred in 3 patients. Transection of varicose vessels in patients with nose bleeds leads to a decrease in the number of bleeds.

"input: Abstract: The classical concept of the autonomic innervation of the nasal mucosa states that the postganglionic sympathetic neurones lie in the superior cervical ganglion and those of the postganglionic parasympathetic neurones are in the pterygopalatine ganglion. We have carried out a study of the fine structure of the respiratory nasal mucosa in man and in the cat using the techniques described by Jabonero, Champy Maillet and Koelle-Friedenwald. The most striking finding was the presence of microganglia deep within the mucosa of the inferior turbinate close to the glands. These microganglia were cholinergic in nature since they demonstrated a positive reaction to anticholinesterase. From this we deduce that the nasal parasympathetic pathway has its postganglionic neurones not only in the pterygopalatine ganglion but also in these microganglia of the inferior turbinate. Each of four groups of cats were submitted to different techniques, including administration of neostigmine, inferior turbinectomy and Vidian neurectomy. Resection of the microganglia by means of turbinectomy reduced the hypersecretion caused by neostigmine and this was most noticeable when a Vidian neurectomy was carried out in addition.

"input: Abstract: We examined the occurrence of crystals and casts in the urine of healthy subjects after administration of triamterene and the site of crystal formation in experimental animals. Twenty out of twenty healthy subjects had abundant triamterene crystals and casts in acid urine after receiving a single 100 mg dose. Casts were present in the urine from 2-11 hours after administration of the diuretic. Cast formation occurred in acidic urine and was prevented by alkalinization of the urine with potassium citrate. Animal studies showed that crystallization and cast formation occurred in the medullary and papillary collecting ducts of the rat kidney. These findings provide a possible explanation for the reported nephrotoxicity of triamterene, particularly when given to patients who are receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents.

"input: Abstract: The intraperitoneal fibrin formation and its inhibition by intraperitoneal heparin (5000 U) was investigated in six patients on CAPD. The intraperitoneal heparin concentration decreased linearily from 1.78 U/ml to 1.13 U/ml during a 4-hour dwell time. The antithrombin III-concentration increased to 0.56 +/- 0.1 mg/dl, reaching 1.87% of normal plasma values. The antithrombin III-portion of total protein was 0.62% in plasma and 0.79% in dialysate. The fibrinopeptide A-concentration, a specific product of thrombin action on fibrinogen was 37.1 +/- 11.8 ng/ml in plasma (normal range: less than 2.5 ng/ml) and 153.4 +/- 16.8 ng/ml in dialysate during regular CAPD. After the addition of 5000 U heparin the fibrinopeptide A-concentration in dialysate decreased to 11.6 +/- 2.6 ng/ml during a 4-hour dwell time. In vitro experiments showed no remarkable inhibition of fibrin formation by heparin without antithrombin III in dialysate. We suggest that the fibrinopeptide A is produced intraperitoneally and the antithrombin III-concentration in dialysate is sufficient to inhibit the fibrin formation after acceleration by heparin.

An osteoid osteoma of the pedicle of the fourth cervical vertebra occurred in a 17-year-old girl. Resection of the tumor adjacent to the dura medially and the vertebral artery anterolaterally was accomplished via a transpillar approach. The transosseus approach preserved the facet joints and posterior elements and obviated the need for an interbody fusion.

"input: Abstract: Twenty-three patients with idiopathic scoliosis were tested for upper extremity proprioceptive function. All subjects had documented progression of deformity, with an average curvature of 34 degrees. The average ages for scoliotics and 18 control subjects were 16.1 and 20.8 years, respectively. Controls had no spinal deformity and underwent identical test procedures. The test results showed that scoliotic subjects had significant asymmetry between right and left limbs in their threshold for detection of joint motion (p less than or equal to 0.005) and in their ability to reproduce angles to which their elbow joint had been previously positioned (p less than or equal to 0.025). Slight asymmetry also was observed in the reproduction tests of the control group (p less than or equal to 0.013); however, there was no significant asymmetry seen in this group for the threshold test. Performance of bilateral limbs was designated good and bad for both groups; the limb that performed better in proprioceptive function was designated good limb. Analysis of data showed that the scoliotics' good and bad limbs performed inferiorly in both threshold and angle reproduction tests when compared with normal controls. The results of this study imply, but do not localize, a neurologic deficit in scoliotic patients.

"input: Abstract: The Inyo nail is a new intramedullary device for the treatment of fractures of the distal fibula. It is a tapered V-shaped nail made of malleable stainless steel, which provides rigid fracture fixation. Torsional stress is resisted because of its triflanged shape. It may be introduced closed, using the image intensifier. Two groups of patients were evaluated: Group I was treated with the Inyo nail and Group II was treated by the Association For the Study of Internal Fixation (ASIF) technique. Eighty-five percent of the patients in Group I were rated as good, compared with 63% in Group II. There was significantly less morbidity and complications in Group I. Several factors must be observed in the treatment of ankle fractures. Stress radiographs must be obtained intraoperative. Surgery may be indicated in unstable supination lateral rotation Type II injuries, if these occur in patients with high physical demands. Anatomic reduction of the lateral malleolus must be obtained. Early weight-bearing and motion produces the best result. Late reconstruction of malunions can be accomplished using the Inyo nail.

"input: Abstract: In a prospective study, 24 high school football players with isolated Grade III injuries of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) of the knee were treated by conservative management. This included an active rehabilitation program, progressing from immobilization and controlled motion in an orthotic rehabilitation knee brace, to muscle strengthening and agility exercise. A stable knee was achieved in 22 cases; the average recovery time was 29 days. The athletes returned to competitive sports at a mean time of 34 days. These results confirm previous reports of successful nonoperative management of isolated Grade III MCL injuries.

"input: Abstract: Using roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA), the integrity of the bond between the tibial component and the tibia was studied in seven knees, implanted with a cemented Kinematic total knee prosthesis for gonarthrosis. Migration ranging from 0.3 to 1.9 mm over a two-year period occurred in all seven cases. Displacement, induced by external forces, ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 mm was observed in five cases. Measurable migration and inducible displacement may be the rule rather than an exception in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Accordingly, absolute rigid fixation would not be necessary for successful function of a TKA.

"input: Abstract: The functional results of 28 cases of rupture of the quadriceps and patellar tendons are reported. Excellent or good results were noted in 15 of 18 quadriceps and 7 of 10 patellar tendons. Radiographic comparison with the opposite knee disclosed incongruences between the patella and the femoral groove in the tangential view and/or cranial-caudal position of the patella in the lateral view in 13 of the quadriceps tendon ruptures and seven of the patellar tendon ruptures. Patients with residual pain had patellofemoral incongruity but since two-thirds of the patients with incongruity were asymptomatic, incongruity alone may not be the cause of the symptoms. There was no positive correlation to muscular strength or range of movement. Nevertheless, exact adaptation of the patellar tendon and periarticular tissue seems necessary to obtain correct patello-femoral articulation. Reinforcement of the tendon with a wire cerclage is recommended to decrease the tension on the suture line and the consequent risk of a secondary rupture. In acute ruptures of the quadriceps tendon end-to-end sutures are sufficient.

"input: Abstract: In reconstructing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) it is important to place the inner ends of the drill channels correctly, to get the ACL into an isometric position. Anatomic studies demonstrate the value of a modified surgical technique using a special drill guide for standardized positioning of the anterior cruciate substitute. The drill guide consists of a metal frame with one adjustable and one fixed guide tube. Drilling is done from the anteromedial aspect of the tibia, upwards, through the joint space and the femur in a straight line, both channels being drilled in a single procedure. The precision of guided drilling was superior to that of free-hand drilling in positioning the ligament in the correct anatomic place.

"input: Abstract: The presence of patella alta has been linked to recurrent dislocation of the patella and the patello-femoral stress syndrome. It is not known whether patella alta is an inherited or acquired trait. To investigate the relationship of patella during the adolescent growth spurt, serial orthoroentgenograms (growth study films) were retrospectively analyzed in 19 patients. Two were found in whom proximal patella migration could be correlated (r = 0.85) with femoral growth rate. This was significant at the p = 0.01 level. Girls had a higher correlation of patella height to growth rate than boys. In certain cases, patella alta is an acquired rather than inherited condition; this supports the theory that overgrowth during the growth spurt can lead to patella alta in some individuals.

"input: Abstract: Computed tomography measurements of tibial torsion were evaluated in 85 patients with medial-type osteoarthritic knees and in 24 normal adults. Although there were no differences in the degrees of femoral torsion or knee joint rotation, external tibial torsion was observed to have a mean value of 11.3 degrees, significantly smaller than the 23.5 degrees observed in the normal adults (p less than 0.01). The more advanced the osteoarthritic stage, the greater was the reduction in external tibial torsion. Reduction of external torsion of the tibia was most severe at the proximal tibial metaphysis.

"input: Abstract: A technique for ipsilateral femoral neck and shaft fracture using the sliding compression hip screw with plate combined with trochanteric antegrade Ender nailing of the femur was applied in two cases. Ender nails can be passed without difficulty past a compression hip screw and the bicortical plating screws. The hip and femur can be fixed internally through a single approach in a single position. Sliding compression hip screw devices can provide excellent preliminary stable femoral neck fixation. Blood supply to the femoral head is not disturbed while the femoral intramedullary fixation is performed. Antegrade Ender nailing avoids the common knee complications associated with other retrograde techniques. Decreased operative time, less blood loss, less technical difficulty, and early mobilization are important factors in the multiple-injured patient. Femoral intramedullary fixation may require open reduction, circlerage to ensure stability, and maintenance of alignment in case of significant comminution to allow early crutch ambulation. This mode of fixation may be advantageous for selected cases.

"input: Abstract: More than 90% of patients with so-called primary or idiopathic osteoarthritis of the hips in whom sufficient data were available to make an assessment of the normality of the hip joint at the cessation of growth clearly showed demonstrable abnormalities in the hip joint. The most common are mild acetabular dysplasia and/or pistol grip deformity. This latter deformity is associated with mild slipped capital femoral epiphysis (recognized or unrecognized at the time), Legg-Perthes' disease (recognized or unrecognized at the time), multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, and/or the presence of an intraacetabular labrum, as well as, in certain instances, acetabular dysplasia. When these abnormalities are taken in conjunction with the detection of other metabolic abnormalities that can lead to osteoarthritis of the hip and which may not be recognized readily, such as hemochromatosis, ochronosis, calcium pyrophosphate disease, and monarticular rheumatoid arthritis, it seems clear that either osteoarthritis of the hip does not exist at all as a primary disease entity or, if it does, is extraordinarily rare.

"input: Abstract: In two typical cases of calcaneal fracture dislocation, the primary fracture, which runs forward and medially from a point behind the sustentaculum tali, is associated with inversion of the hindfoot. The calcaneus splits into a small anteromedial and a larger posterolateral fragment. Rupture of the lateral collateral ligament allows the posterolateral calcaneal fragment to move laterally to lie immediately subjacent to the distal fibula. Closed reduction is impossible. Open reduction of this rare fracture dislocation is essential. A lateral approach to the calcaneus is generally sufficient, but a second medial incision may be required.

Despite the persistence of the synostosis, the patient adapted to loss of forearm rotation. No further treatment was necessary. Isolated fractures of the ulnar shaft are slow in healing. Several authors observed that early function may be beneficial. However, excessive activity causing motion at the fracture site may cause subperiosteal hemorrhage and soft tissue trauma and may stimulate exuberant callus formation. Fractures of the ulnar shaft, even undisplaced, need to be immobilized to prevent overuse.

"input: Abstract: Recognizing that not all patients with low back pain have lumbar disc disease, the authors began to inject facet joints in June 1982 and have experience now with 21 patients, each injected under fluoroscopic control with a mixture of local anesthetic and steroid. One technical problem occurred when large osteophytes blocked access to the facet joints. Otherwise, there were no complications and minimal morbidity. Most patients (15 of 20; 75%) had an initial response, but a much smaller number (six of 18 followed more than three months; 33%) had a lasting response. Repeat injections, when done, always led to temporary improvement but rarely to lasting relief (one of five; 20%). Three factors characterized the patients: a negative screening examination for other causes of back pain or sciatica; back pain with tenderness localized over one or more facet joints; and radiologic changes of degenerative joint disease within the facet joints. Facet joint disease may be a significant cause of low back pain. The above three criteria are useful in clinical identification of patients with this problem. Facet joint injections play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain.

"input: Abstract: Light and electron microscopy were used to demonstrate extensive matrix degradation in a failed chymopapain-treated disc as compared with an untreated degenerative control disc. Both specimens contained viable cells with patches of degenerative cells. There was a loss of disc height in the chymopapain-treated disc, but no improvement of symptoms. These results illustrated that even in well-circumscribed cases with documented disc protrusion into the spinal canal, the disc space narrowing following injection may aggravate the symptoms of nerve root entrapment, especially if a low-grade lateral recess stenosis is associated with the disc protrusion. The persistence or aggravation of symptoms probably is related to these anatomic considerations. The low level of enzyme activity in the injected area may or may not be correlated with the clinical response to treatment.

"input: Abstract: Of 34 tibia fractures in 28 acute spinal cord injuries, 13 patients had complete and 15 had incomplete neurologic lesions. Tibia fractures were divided into three groups: Group I, nonoperative treatment; Group II, early open reduction and internal fixation; and Group III, Type III open injuries. Group I included 17 fractures, of which nine (53%) had delayed union, malunion, or nonunion. The average time to union was 6.5 months. Seven patients had pressure sores and pulmonary emboli. Eleven fractures were noted in Group II. One delayed union (9%), one superficial wound infection that healed uneventfully, and one deep vein thrombosis were noted. The average time to union was 12 weeks. All six Group III tibias had delayed and nonunions, regardless of treatment. Nonoperative fractures healed at a prolonged rate, while open reduction and internal fixation enhanced the rate and time to union. Fractures treated with early open reduction and internal fixation, excluding Group III patients, had the least orthopedic and medical complications. Open reduction and internal fixation is a justifiable alternative to nonoperative treatment in the uncomplicated tibia fracture regardless of neurologic lesion for improved medical and fracture care.

"input: Abstract: Maquet recommended 2-2.5 cm of anterior tibial tubercle elevation for patients with symptomatic osteoarthrosis of the patellofemoral joint. Fifty-three patients with osteoarthrosis were divided into three groups. The first 12 patients were treated by the classical Maquet procedure; 11 were totally relieved of patellofemoral pain, but there was one failure and five complications. In the second group of 32 patients, the patella was realigned within its groove to alter tracking of the patella to the proximal femoral condyles when necessary. Fish-mouthing technique and insertion of a drain after surgery were done. After a two-year follow-up examination, there were two failures and five complications. A third group of nine patients was treated with Ferguson's modification of Maquet's operation using a 1.25-cm tibial tubercle elevation through a transverse incision; two of the nine had complications, subsequently treated successfully by converting Ferguson's operation into the Maquet operation, as modified for Group II. The modified Maquet procedure can be an effective and reliable treatment of patellofemoral arthrosis with a relatively low incidence of complications.

"input: Abstract: Localized regions of mineralization were found in confluent cultures of rabbit marrow fibroblastic cells. The mineralized tissue developed within clusters of giant fat cells in the spaces between the cells. Investigations with light and electron microscopy demonstrated that in these sites there was some differentiation of the fibroblastic cells in an osteogenic direction, shown by changes to more polygonal shapes, and the synthesis of well-banded collagen similar to that found in bone tissue. Differentiation may be due, in part, to increased cell density in a confined space. Growth of the mineralized tissue was observed in the living cultures with a fluorescence microscope. Electron probe microanalysis confirmed that the mineral formed was hydroxyapatite. Initiating sites of mineralization included membranous vesicular bodies, lipid, and products of cellular degeneration. Once initiated, mineralization appeared to spread rapidly into adjacent collagenous and other structures, suggesting the appearance of a mixture of skeletal-type and dystrophic mineralization.

"input: Abstract: Published normal histomorphometric data were used to derive distributions of thicknesses of trabecular plates and completed bone remodelling units (the basic multicellular unit carrying out bone remodelling, the BMU, when completed is termed a structural unit BSU). A stochastic model was set up to investigate the predictions of current BMU theory. Each of 100 trabecular ""thicknesses"" was drawn from the appropriate normal distribution using a pseudorandom number generator. Each day, each of its two surfaces when quiescent was assumed to have a 1:900 chance of initiating a remodelling cycle. Resorption (active, 12 days; reversal phase, 27 days) was followed by formation (94 +/- 35 days) and resulted in BMU balance when resorption depth was 36.8 +/- 9.2 micron. Fenestration (thickness less than 0) was assumed to lead to permanent loss of the trabecula. The original model unrealistically increased its mean trabecular thickness as thin trabeculae were lost. This was corrected by assuming that thin trabeculae had greater osteoblastic stimulation and a consequent tendency to thicken, perhaps due to higher mechanical loading. Over 20 years, 14% of trabeculae were lost when the BMU balance was exact and the distribution of trabecular thicknesses was unchanged. About one-half of fenestrations were due to deeper-than-average resorption cavities developing in thin trabeculae, and the remainder to coincident remodelling on both surfaces. A 10% fall in osteoblast lifespan resulted in an additional 36.7% loss of trabecular bone volume and mean trabecular thickness fell to 83.1 micron, compatible with Courpron's data. Simulating more rapid mechanisms of bone loss, approximately 50% of trabeculae could be lost after ten years by the arrest of bone formation; the doubling of resorption depth with unchanged bone formation; and a doubling in the rate of initiation of new BMUs with unchanged bone formation rate, all three followed by complete recovery of BMU balance after only two years. In each case, mean trabecular thickness fell only transiently but trabeculae continued to be lost after recovery. Prolonged osteoblast life span was the most likely explanation for the increased mean trabecular thicknesses and trabecular bone volumes seen in patients with osteoporosis, when treated with sodium fluoride plus calcium supplements or daily injections of parathyroid peptide hPTH 1-34.

"input: Abstract: A 17-year-old girl had a multicentric giant cell tumor originating in the sphenoid and sella turcica that was observed for 23 years. During the first 12 years, the same lesion also appeared in the right proximal tibia and left distal radius. Curettage of the tibial lesion and packing with processed bovine bone were followed by a chronic osteomyelitis with continued intermittent wound drainage. Curettage of the radial lesion and packing it initially with autogenous iliac bone graft and subsequently with methylmethacrylate bone cement were followed by local recurrences. The radial lesion eventually was eradicated by a segmental resection of the distal radius. The resulting bony defect was bridged with a bicortical autogenous iliac graft and stabilized with a bone plate to produce a painless solid wrist fusion. No further tumor recurrence has been noted for the past two years.

"input: Abstract: Osteoarthrosis is a physiologic imbalance, a ""joint failure"" similar to ""heart failure,"" in which mechanical factors play a role. The initiation and progression of cartilage damage are distinct phenomena. One of the mechanisms of initiation may be a steep stiffness gradient in the underlying subchondral bone. Progression of cartilage lesions probably requires stiffened subchondral bone. In such situations, transverse stresses at the base of the articular cartilage could cause deep horizontal splits in that tissue. The most likely cause of subchondral stiffening in an otherwise congruent joint is repeated failure of the musculoskeletal peak dynamic force attenuation mechanisms. The health and integrity of the overlying articular cartilage depends on the mechanical properties of its bony bed. In certain models of osteoarthrosis, alterations of the bony bed occur before the cartilage changes and suggest that this can occur in clinical conditions. Stiffening of the subchondral bone also can effect joint conformation, which involves deformation of articular cartilage and bone to create maximum contact areas under load.

"input: Abstract: Although osteoarthritis (OA) generally is considered a disorder of mechanical origin, the common occurrence of chronic mononuclear cell infiltrates in the synovium in conjunction with immunofluorescent evidence for immune-reactant products in cartilage of surgical case specimens (knees, hips, and peripheral joints) has suggested the local involvement of immune processes in the arthritis. Further, the findings of polyarthropathy in the majority of these cases have indicated the propensity for a systemic disorder. Wide variations were noted in both synovial and cartilage immune changes, quite different to those found in rheumatoid arthritis, along with the frequent asymptomatology of the many joints involved. These features, with and without other causative factors, suggest that immune reactions of local and/or systemic origin occur at times in a population at risk for joint degradation.

"input: Abstract: Clinical and laboratory observations suggest that a relationship exists between sex hormones and the development of osteoarthritis. The mechanisms whereby these hormones influence the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis have been explored. Tamoxifen, an estrogen antagonist, reduced erosive changes in meniscectomy-induced osteoarthritis in rabbits. By contrast, estradiol worsened it. There was no effect of either agent on the incidence of osteophytes in this model. Both estradiol and tamoxifen affected proteoglycan, prostaglandin, and proteoglycanase production by cartilage components. These observations suggest that cartilage is a sex hormone-sensitive tissue. This may have therapeutic implications in the future.

"input: Abstract: It is clear that some synovial inflammation occurs in joints affected by osteoarthritis (OA) and it is well recognized that many patients with OA experience a decrease in pain and joint stiffness following administration of salicylates or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, neither the extent to which synovitis contributes to the cartilage breakdown in OA nor the effects of chronic administration of NSAIDs on the natural history of OA in humans is known. Recent studies indicate that several NSAIDs, including salicylates, suppress proteoglycan synthesis in articular cartilage in vitro. The effect on OA cartilage is more marked than that on normal cartilage. Other studies show that salicylate feeding may suppress proteoglycan metabolism in degenerating cartilage in vivo, aggravating the decrease in proteoglycan content caused by the disease itself. However, no effect of salicylates on normal articular cartilage has been observed in vivo. In damaged cartilage the magnitude of NSAID-induced suppression of proteoglycan metabolism appears to be related inversely to the proteoglycan content of the tissue. In addition, the NSAIDs used in treatment of arthritis today may differ with respect to their in vivo effects on articular cartilage metabolism due, in part, to differences between the molar concentrations of these drugs in synovial fluid.

"input: Abstract: Repetitive chest pain of obscure origin is commonly encountered in older children and adolescents. A questionnaire study was conducted to determine the long-term outcome in 31 patients diagnosed as having idiopathic recurrent chest pain after an average 4.1-year follow-up period. Although 45 percent reported having had persistent symptoms, chest pain had disappeared in 81 percent of those followed more than 3 years. Equally reassuring is the fact that in no case did occult disease subsequently appear to account for the initial symptoms. This study supports the current clinical approach of limited diagnostic evaluation and reassurance in the management of these patients.

A retrospective study was conducted by chart reviews of 27 patients with documented ethanol ingestion admitted to the Alberta Children's Hospital, Foothills Provincial Hospital, Calgary General Hospital or Holy Cross Hospital from 1969 to 1984. Six patients had hypoglycemia and one experienced a convulsion. The rate of alcohol elimination was found to be greater than 6.2 mM/L/hr (28.4 mg/dl/hr), approximately twice the rate seen in adults. Six patients had hypokalemia, and two had severe metabolic acidosis.

"input: Abstract: Between October 1982 and October 1985, the Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) in Jerusalem responded to 625 pediatric emergencies, representing 5% of the total MICU case load. The most common medical problem was seizures, diagnosed in 205 cases (33%). The second most frequent group related to trauma (175 cases; 28%). There were 71 cases (11.4%) of cardiac arrest. Resuscitation was attempted in 37, but there were no long-term survivors. Almost all cardiac arrest patients were found in asystole, and most had antecedent serious medical problems. Compared with the adult population, children were less likely to require or benefit from an advanced level of prehospital care. When resources for advanced care are limited, priority should be given to adult emergencies.

"input: Abstract: The combined effects on performance of two anxiolytics with different mechanisms of action were evaluated double-blind and crossover in 12 healthy students. Objective (tracking, divided attention, Maddox wing, etc.) and subjective (visual analogue scales and questionnaires) tests were done before and twice after single oral doses. Diazepam (0.15 and 0.30 mg/kg) impaired performance dose relatedly and rendered the subjects drowsy, calm, mentally slow, and clumsy. Buspirone (15 mg) proved inactive in objective tests but matched diazepam (0.30 mg/kg) subjectively. In combinations, buspirone added to the effects of diazepam in Maddox wing and letter cancellation but tended to counteract diazepam effects on divided attention and learning acquisition. Subjectively buspirone prolonged diazepam-induced sedation. Increased calmness caused by diazepam was not affected by concomitant buspirone. It is suggested that combining small doses of buspirone to diazepam does not cause any additional decrement in psychomotor performance. Possible advantages of the diazepam-buspirone combination in therapeutic use are discussed.

"input: Abstract: SQ 28,668 is a structural analog of thromboxane A2. It inhibits the effects of thromboxane in vitro. Fifty-six healthy male subjects were given either placebo or three equal daily doses of SQ 28,668 ranging from 25 to 1200 mg. Plasma drug concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner. The shape of the plasma drug concentration-time curve was consistent with enterohepatic recirculation. The effects of SQ 28,668 on ex vivo platelet aggregation suggested that SQ 28,668 is a specific competitive antagonist of thromboxane A2 with a platelet receptor dissociation constant (estimated by Schild analysis) of about 19 nmol/L. Approximately 94% occupation of thromboxane receptors by SQ 28,668 was required to produce a small but measurable increase of the template bleeding time. Dose-ranging studies of antithrombotic drugs are difficult and expensive. For this reason, a method was developed that allows estimation of the dose of a thromboxane receptor antagonist that would be expected to be therapeutically equivalent to a given dose of aspirin.

"input: Abstract: Pinacidil is an investigational vasodilator currently undergoing clinical trials as an antihypertensive agent. It is metabolized in humans to pinacidil N-oxide. To determine whether pinacidil's metabolism or effects were influenced by either liver disease or the subject's debrisoquin phenotype, eight patients with chronic stable cirrhosis and 13 healthy subjects were studied. Seven of the healthy volunteers were extensive metabolizers of debrisoquin, whereas six were of the poor metabolizer phenotype. Neither the clearance of pinacidil nor the production of the N-oxide was altered by the subjects' debrisoquin phenotype. Cirrhosis produced a 50% reduction in pinacidil's clearance (20.7 +/- 1.4 vs. 42.1 +/- 5.1 L/hr; P less than 0.0005) and a prolongation in the elimination t1/2 from 3.9 +/- 0.3 to 6.1 +/- 0.6 hours (P less than 0.01). Less pinacidil was metabolized to the N-oxide metabolite in the patients with cirrhosis than in the normal individuals. Thus pinacidil's metabolism and clearance are reduced in patients with cirrhosis but are independent of debrisoquin phenotype.

"input: Abstract: Intravenous cimetidine, 300 mg or 400 mg, or ranitidine, 50 mg, was administered as a single dose to 36 volunteers in a randomized, crossover fashion. Aspirates of gastric juice were obtained after dosing, and the pH, titratable acidity, gastric fluid volume, and gastric acid output were determined from baseline through 71/2 hours for each subject. Each intervention significantly increased pH and suppressed hydrogen ion concentration, gastric fluid volume, and gastric acid output. Both the magnitudes of the changes when compared with baseline and the time of the mean maximum effects were similar in all three drug regimens. The effect of all three interventions on gastric fluid volume and gastric acid output diminished sharply after 6 hours. The data indicate that the gastric secretory response to all three interventions did not differ substantially.

"input: Abstract: To determine the systemic absorption of epinephrine when it is given by inhalation, six normal volunteers were given 15 puffs, followed by 30 puffs, of epinephrine from a pressurized aerosol (160 micrograms epinephrine/puff). The peak mean (+/- SE) plasma epinephrine levels were 1.50 (+/- 0.61) and 4.22 (+/- 1.93) nmol/L 1 minute after each dose, respectively. The effect on physiologic finger tremor correlated with the plasma epinephrine level and returned to baseline 20 minutes after taking the higher dose. There was a small fall in mean plasma potassium levels of 0.45 mmol/L and a small rise in plasma glucose levels of 0.81 mmol/L. On a separate occasion an injection of 0.3 ml of 1/1000 (300 micrograms) epinephrine was given subcutaneously to the same individuals. This caused a peak plasma epinephrine level of 2.43 (+/- 0.47) nmol/L at 10 minutes, and this was still raised at 2.05 (+/- 0.41) nmol/L after 40 minutes. The maximum fall in the mean plasma potassium level was 0.43 mmol/L after the injection.

"input: Abstract: Reductions in left ventricular (LV) mass have been reported after antihypertensive therapy with certain sympatholytic agents and converting enzyme inhibitors, but little or no improvement has been noted after vasodilator therapy. In this study we evaluated the effect of the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine on echocardiographic LV mass. During a 12-month period, nitrendipine was used as monotherapy in 30 patients and in combination with propranolol or a diuretic in an additional 28 patients. Nitrendipine monotherapy lowered supine blood pressure from 148/97 to 136/83 mm Hg, but LV mass did not change significantly. Supine blood pressure decreased from 155/103 to 134/86 mm Hg in patients receiving combination therapy but, again, changes in LV mass were not significant. These data suggest that nitrendipine is effective in lowering blood pressure, but this is not associated with a significant decrease in LV mass in patients with mild hypertension.

"input: Abstract: Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' is an Australian hybrid plant which may cause allergic contact dermatitis. Over the past 8 years, it has been planted extensively in Australia and is now being exported to the United States and other Western countries. Recently, an explosion in incidence of contact dermatitis due to this plant has been seen. 24 patients who were suspected of being sensitive to it were patch tested to fresh plant and extracts with confirmation of sensitivity. A cross sensitivity to Toxicodendron was demonstrated clinically and on patch testing. The allergen in Toxicodendron, 3 pentadecylcatechol, is closely linked in chemical structure to 5-pentadecylresorcinol, present in Grevillea banksii and tridecylresorcinol in Grevillea robusta. Patch testing in patients sensitive to Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' with tridecylresorcinol produced positive reactions, thus implicating the sensitizing role of long chain alkyl resorcinols in Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' allergy. There is a likelihood that this sensitizing potential extends to other plants of the Grevillea genus, e.g., Grevillea robusta. With the spread of Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' to other markets, this problem will become increasingly common.

There was an overall female preponderance (61%), with 2 peaks of incidence in the 10-20 and 40-50 year age groups in females, but only 1 peak of incidence in the 40-50 year age group in males. There was a steady decline in all sensitivities after the 6th decade of life in both sexes. Nickel sensitivity was more common in females (92%), whereas dichromate sensitivity predominated in males (64%). Of the 200 patients, only 5(2.5%) were atopics, all of whom were females.

"input: Abstract: Irritant skin reactions from repeated open applications of low concentrations of sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) have been studied macroscopically and microscopically in guinea pigs. After 3 applications daily for 3 days, 2% SLS aqueous solutions gave a naked eye assessment, increase in epidermal thickness and total dermal inflammatory cell response, which was greater than for a 1% SLS solution. The dermal inflammatory cell response was mainly mononuclear (lymphocytic) in nature. With the SLS reactions as control, various organic solvents were studied and ranked against the SLS reactions and internally. Trichlorethylene was the most irritant solvent, ranking as high as 2% SLS. Other chlorinated hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons tested caused irritant reactions. The alcohols and acetone gave no reaction. White spirit was as irritant as trichlorethylene. Thinners were less irritant, around the level of the 1% SLS control reaction. The 4-day experimental design is a convenient and suitable animal model for screening irritant potential, and provides information relevant to the pathogenesis of irritant contact reactions.

"input: Abstract: The impact of occlusion and the role of the counter ion on the permeation of nickel ions through skin have been examined using excised human skin. A highly sensitive electrochemical method was used to quantify the amount of nickel permeating the skin. The investigations show that nickel ions are capable of permeating the skin barrier when applied under occlusion. The process is slow, having a lag time of approximately 50 h. The permeation rate, and thus the physical amount being bioavailable, is considerably increased when aqueous nickel chloride is used in comparison with aqueous nickel sulphate. With respect to nickel permeation of the skin, we conclude that the choice of salt is an important consideration in patch testing.

"input: Abstract: Placement of an unheated miniaturized oxygen electrode against the palpebral conjunctiva permits noninvasive measurement of tissue oxygen tension. In this study, the relationship between conjunctival oxygen tension (PcjO2) and standard cardiorespiratory variables was examined during a sequential resuscitation protocol after acute hemorrhage. Anesthetized dogs were rapidly bled to a mean arterial pressure of 40 mm Hg and then retransfused with the shed blood in a stepwise fashion. PcjO2 fell to 2% of control values after hemorrhage and did not return to prehemorrhage values until more than 90% of the shed blood had been reinfused. PcjO2 was among the last set of cardiorespiratory variables to return to control values during resuscitation and was the last noninvasive variable to normalize. The ratio of PcjO2 to arterial oxygen tension decreased from a prehemorrhage value of 0.76 +/- 0.05 (SEM) to 0.02 +/- 0.003 after hemorrhage, and did not increase to values greater than 0.50 until resuscitation was more than 90% complete. Conjunctival oxygen monitoring may play an important role in assessing the adequacy of resuscitation after acute hemorrhage.

"input: Abstract: Oxygen consumption (VO2), CO2 production, respiratory quotient, resting metabolic expenditure (RME), and urine catecholamine levels were measured in 52 patients with acute cerebrovascular disease. RME correlated positively with urinary norepinephrine and epinephrine excretion; its maximum value was 187% higher than expected for an uninjured resting person of equivalent age, sex, and size. VO2 correlated positively with the urinary catecholamine excretion. These facts imply that the sympathetic nervous system might directly influence VO2 and RME. Moreover, the hypermetabolic state should be taken into consideration when caring for patients with cerebrovascular disease, as malnutrition might cause weight loss and a decrease in immunity.

Other researchers have measured air flow resistance through endotracheal tubes. In this study, we evaluated work of breathing in joules per min and tension-time index while three normal volunteers breathed through different sized endotracheal tubes. Four 27.5-cm endotracheal tubes were used. Subjects breathed with a constant tidal volume of 500 ml. By increasing respiratory frequency, minute ventilation was increased from 5 to 30 L/min. As tube diameter decreased, work and the tension-time index increased. Changes were magnified at higher minute ventilations through the 6- and 7-mm endotracheal tubes, and the tension-time index critical fatigue level of 0.15 was approached or exceeded.

"input: Abstract: The effects of dobutamine on hemodynamic and oxygen transport were evaluated in 43 studies on 34 critically ill general (noncardiac) surgical patients. Dobutamine, beginning at a low dose (2.5 micrograms/kg X min) significantly increased cardiac index (CI), oxygen delivery (DO2), and oxygen consumption (VO2), while decreasing mean arterial pressure, pulmonary artery and wedge pressures, and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances; blood gases, pH, and pulmonary shunt were not significantly changed. These effects were seen in postoperative and septic patients, as well as in patients with normal, low, and high control CI. These responses were poor in terminally ill and hypovolemic patients; however, when the latter were given additional fluids, their responses were markedly improved. The hemodynamic effects of dobutamine are well known, but the DO2 and VO2 effects, which suggest improved tissue perfusion, have not been appreciated.

"input: Abstract: Cardiac output was measured 120 times in 27 critically ill patients using the thermodilution and transthoracic electrical impedance methods. Both the minimum and mean values for the distance between the inner electrodes, and a variety of values for the resistivity of blood (rho) were substituted in the Kubicek's empiric formula for calculating cardiac output by transthoracic electrical impedance. Using the mean distance between the inner electrodes and a rho-value of 150 ohm X cm gave the best agreement between the methods (mean difference 0.17 +/- 2.4 L/min). Ventilation alone or with positive end-expiratory pressure did not significantly affect the bias of the estimate, but both affected its precision when compared with measurements in spontaneously breathing patients (SD of mean difference 2.4 and 3.2 L/min, respectively, vs. 1.5 L/min). The pulmonary artery wedge pressure was significantly higher in patients with an abnormal diastolic impedance waveform (zero-wave), but there was no relationship between wedge pressure and base impedance per unit length between the measuring electrodes.

"input: Abstract: To achieve adequate arterial BP, adequate capillary filling time, and adequate peripheral pulses, hypotensive newborn infants often require higher doses of dopamine that reportedly reduce urine output in adults. Whether these larger doses of dopamine also reduce urine output in newborns is not known. Therefore, we determined the effects of administering high-dose dopamine (more than 20 micrograms/kg X min) on the urine output of 15 newborn infants. Five infants were studied prospectively and ten retrospectively. In the prospective study, urine output was determined as the dose of dopamine was increased; in the retrospective study, urine output was determined as the infants were being weaned from high doses of dopamine. Both data sets demonstrate that administering high-dosage dopamine does not reduce the urine output of sick newborn infants. Therefore, we conclude that doses of dopamine previously reported to decrease urine output in adults do not do so in sick newborn infants. Consequently, when necessary, high doses of dopamine may be used in sick newborn infants to achieve cardiovascular stability without reducing urine output.

"input: Abstract: We studied the value of transcutaneous carbon dioxide (PtcCO2) monitoring during neonatal transport. Thirty-two neonates with respiratory distress were alternately enrolled in an experimental group (results of PtcO2 and PtcCO2 available for clinical management) and a control group (results of only PtcO2 available). Although differences were not significant, infants in the experimental group had more changes in the intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) settings during transport, and more such infants arrived at the receiving hospital with acceptable pH and PCO2 values. On arrival at the receiving hospital, two patients in the control group had acidosis and hypercarbia and were placed on IMV immediately on arrival. No such patients were encountered in the experimental group. For patients needing IMV during transport, the percentage of study time spent with PtcCO2 measurements in the normal range (35 to 45 torr) was greater for the experimental group (p less than .02). Continuous PtcCO2 monitoring during transport offers the opportunity to further decrease the risks of transporting a critically ill neonate.

"input: Abstract: The applicability of continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration (CAVH) for renal replacement therapy was evaluated in three infants and two young children with catastrophic medical and surgical illnesses. In the first four patients, CAVH was used in conjunction with either peritoneal or hemodialysis. In the fifth patient, CAVH was the sole renal replacement therapy employed; in this critically ill anuric infant, we were best able to evaluate the ability of CAVH to continuously control fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance, and allow the administration of adequate parenteral nutrition. The difficulties encountered were related to anticoagulation, establishment of adequate vascular access, and selection of an appropriate hemofilter for the performance of the technique. Despite the application of suction-assistance, we were unable to effectively employ a prototype pediatric hemofilter to attain a level of plasma ultrafiltration consistent with the objectives of therapy. However, we were able to effectively and safely employ an adult hemofilter for these purposes; modifications were made in the adult hemofilter system before its application in the smallest pediatric patients. Our experience suggests that, even in critically ill infants, CAVH can be successfully applied as an effective renal replacement therapy. However, further experience is required before its potential impact on patient survival can be assessed.

Overt phlebitis or inflammation around the site was 14 times as common with peripheral catheters (353/1,024) than with centrally inserted central catheters (18/713), even though peripheral catheters were removed on the average at 2.9 days and centrally inserted central catheters at 6.2 days. Pneumothorax occurred in seven out of 713 patients with centrally inserted central catheterization, one with hemothorax and two with pneumothoraces requiring thoracostomy tubes. Five were treated successfully with simple catheter aspiration. Three patients out of 1,496 with peripheral or peripherally inserted central catheters required phlebectomy for suppurative thrombophlebitis. We concluded that overall morbidity in critically ill patients is lower from centrally inserted central catheters than peripheral intravenous catheters, with peripherally inserted central catheters in an intermediate position. Supervision of techniques of insertion has to be kept at a high level to keep complications of central catheterization at an acceptable level. Peripheral catheter sites would be better maintained with more frequent replacement of the catheter.

"input: Abstract: We studied the effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate, a respiratory stimulant, on the incidence and duration of episodes of apnea and disordered breathing in 13 nonhypercapnic men with obstructive sleep apnea. Nocturnal polysomnography was done before and after four weeks of treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate (60 mg/day) and one week after cessation of treatment. There were no significant (p less than 0.05) differences in the mean frequency of apneic episodes per hour of sleep before (31.3 +/- 5.7 [+/- SE]), during (26.8 +/- 6.6), or after (23.6 +/- 7.0) treatment, or in the mean number of disordered breathing episodes per hour of sleep before (19.4 +/- 5.6), during (21.4 +/- 5.8), or after (23.1 +/- 6.3) the period of treatment. Medroxyprogesterone did not alter significantly the total time of apnea or the total time for disordered breathing, expressed as percentages of total sleep time. Arterial oxygen desaturation during apnea and disordered breathing did not change with treatment. Medroxyprogesterone increased the minute ventilation and occlusion pressure responses to hypercapnia measured in the awake state; however, the results of this study demonstrate that medroxyprogesterone does not improve the breathing disorders during sleep in the nonhypercapnic patient with obstructive sleep apnea.

"input: Abstract: Twenty one cases of amyloidosis of the lower respiratory tract were seen at a single center. In three patients, multifocal bronchial amyloid plaques led to stenosis and atelectasis, and in two, small pseudotumor masses were an incidental bronchoscopic finding. Two patients had nodular parenchymal amyloidosis, in one of whom the lesions were progressive and in the other static. Fifteen patients had diffuse parenchymal amyloidosis. Two of these had severe interstitial involvement and died in respiratory failure; eight had congestive cardiac failure, and parenchymal amyloidosis was a post-mortem finding; two had senile cardiorespiratory amyloidosis, also found at autopsy; and in three, the amyloidosis was associated with malignancy. The degree of respiratory embarrassment seemed to be related to the amount of amyloid in the gas diffusion zones, irrespective of the etiology of amyloidosis.

"input: Abstract: To evaluate the efficacy of a mild anxiolytic, alprazolam, in relieving dyspnea, we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind study on patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. Twenty-four patients had alprazolam (0.5 mg bid) or placebo administered for one week, followed by placebo for one week, then either placebo or alprazolam for the third week. Assessment tests were performed at the outset, end of the first and second weeks, and finally end of the third week. The parameters measured were: pulmonary function, exercise testing on a bicycle ergometer, and the distance covered in a 12 minute walk. Subjective sensations of dyspnea at rest and during guarded exercise, as well as subjective feelings of calmness or anxiety were also recorded. There was no difference in mechanical lung function, but the PO2 tended to decrease and PCO2 to increase after alprazolam administration. The maximum exercise level attained and the distance covered in the 12 minute walk was unchanged. The subjective perception of dyspnea was the same before and after alprazolam, at rest and during exercise. We conclude that alprazolam is not effective in relieving exercise dyspnea in patients with obstructive lung disease.

"input: Abstract: Mechanical ventilation was able to induce a decrease in cardiac output and regional blood flow, especially hepatic flow. Thus, hepatic elimination of drugs with a high hepatic-extraction ratio, which was linked to alteration in hepatic blood flow, could be reduced during mechanical ventilation. The aim of this work was to determine the effect of mechanical ventilation on pharmacokinetic parameters of lidocaine, which is a well-known nonrestrictive elimination drug at the hepatic level. Five patients (mean age, 58 years) with normal hepatic function and quite similar gasometric parameters before and after weaning from mechanical ventilation were studied. With a washout period of 48 hours between mechanical ventilation and spontaneous ventilation, each patient was submitted to the following protocol: lidocaine in a bolus (1.5 mg/kg intravenously), followed by infusion (1.0 to 1.7 mg/min for 120 minutes). The results were that the peak plasma concentration after the bolus during mechanical ventilation was 3.22 +/- 0.37 mg/L (mean +/- SE) vs 2.40 +/- 0.35 mg/L during spontaneous ventilation (p less than 0.02). Steady-state plasma concentration during mechanical ventilation was 2.10 +/- 0.20 mg/L vs 1.64 +/- 0.16 mg/L during spontaneous ventilation (p less than 0.01). Total clearance was 604.2 +/- 87.0 ml/min during mechanical ventilation vs 775.0 +/- 112.1 ml/min during spontaneous ventilation (p less than 0.01). Elimination half-life was 245.2 +/- 50.6 minutes during mechanical ventilation vs 160.0 +/- 40.6 minutes during spontaneous ventilation (p less than 0.05). Distribution volume was 188.6 +/- 50.2 L during mechanical ventilation and 183.0 +/- 50.8 L during spontaneous ventilation (not significant). These preliminary data clearly demonstrated a decrease in lidocaine elimination in patients submitted to mechanical ventilation, but the magnitude of dosage adjustment of such a highly hepatic-extracted drug in patients submitted to mechanical ventilation remains to be investigated.

"input: Abstract: Upper airway obstruction is usually diagnosed by visual examination of maximum expiratory and inspiratory flow-volume curves and by calculating a ratio of expiratory to inspiratory flow at 50 percent of vital capacity (mid-vital capacity flow ratio); however, reference values of this ratio have not been well established, and considerable variability exists. The purpose of this study was to examine the range of mid-vital capacity flow ratios in a group of healthy subjects and to determine if some of the variability is accounted for by different maximum inspiratory pressures. We measured maximum expiratory and inspiratory flows at 50 percent of vital capacity from the flow-volume curves, and maximum inspiratory pressures in a group of 60 healthy nonsmokers (30 men and 30 women) whose ages ranged from 21 to 40 years. We found that mid-vital capacity flow ratio (mean +/- SD) was 0.72 +/- 0.19 in men and 0.77 +/- 0.18 in women. The coefficient of variation of the mid-vital capacity flow ratio was 28 percent for men and 23 percent for women. The 95 percent confidence limits for the mid-vital capacity flow ratio were 0.65 to 0.79 for men and 0.70 to 0.84 for women. Maximum inspiratory pressures (mean +/- SD) were 129 +/- 30 cm H2O in men and 91 +/- 16 cm H2O in women, not significantly different from previous studies. Normalizing maximum inspiratory flow for maximum inspiratory pressure did not reduce the coefficient of variation, which became 29 percent in men and 30 percent in women. We conclude that the range of mid-vital capacity flow ratios is wide, and it cannot be reduced by standardizing it for maximum inspiratory pressures.

"input: Abstract: The conduction system and the entire heart were examined histologically in four patients with congenital heart disease who had surgery many years before they died suddenly. All were asymptomatic, in sinus rhythm and living normally. The sudden death may have been related to alterations in the conduction system, previously present, or introduced by the previous surgery, or related to inflammatory phenomena, an outgrowth of the previous surgery.

"input: Abstract: Measurement of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is extremely useful as an aid in the diagnosis and longitudinal evaluation of patients with sarcoidosis. We have detected a human serum ACE-inhibitor which affects the ACE level obtained by activity measurements. The effect of the inhibitor can be eliminated by a mere eight-fold dilution of the serum sample with physiologic saline. We recommend that serum ACE be performed with 1:8 dilutions of serum to eliminate the effect of the ACE inhibitor. The inhibitor has a MW above 50,000 daltons, and reversibility of inhibition by dilution appears to be ion dependent. Dialysis of an inhibitor-containing serum sample against saline causes the inhibition to become irreversible, allowing the distinction between alinearity of the assay vs an inhibitor effect when a serum has ACE activity greater than 50 units/ml. The source of the serum ACE-inhibitor remains to be determined.

"input: Abstract: Recurrent pulmonary embolism from the lower extremities or pelvis, despite anticoagulation, often requires interruption of the inferior vena cava (IVC). We report two patients in whom interruption of the IVC failed to ameliorate symptoms. Both patients demonstrated a previously unrecognized duplication of the IVC. We stress the importance of excluding abdominal venous anomalies prior to interrupting the IVC using surgical or percutaneous methods.

"input: Abstract: It is well appreciated that theophylline pharmacokinetics exhibits wide intersubject variation. Within-subject changes in clearance have been generally reported in patients with acute exacerbations of disease states such as cor pulmonale or heart failure. Apparent random changes in theophylline clearance within the same patient have recently been reported. This report describes a case of suspected changes in the clearance of theophylline in a morbidly obese patient (250 kg) over a two-month period of time. Frequent dosage adjustments were required to maintain theophylline concentrations within the range of 8.2 to 27.3 micrograms/ml. Possible explanations for these changes included hypoxia and medically induced starvation. Daily theophylline doses ranged from 600 to 1600 mg/d. It is concluded that in some individuals, within-subject changes in theophylline clearance can be substantial, thus requiring frequent monitoring of theophylline concentration.

"input: Abstract: Distribution and elimination of cefamandole 2 g iv were studied in 11 morbidly obese patients during a gastric bypass operation and again on the first postoperative day. Serum, subcutaneous adipose tissue, wound drainage, and urine were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography for cefamandole and pharmacokinetic parameters from the intraoperative period were compared to those obtained postoperatively. Total body clearance was significantly greater (p less than 0.001) postoperatively (297 ml/min) than intraoperatively (254 ml/min). Volume changes were unpredictable but the elimination rate constant tended to increase postoperatively. Renal clearance and percentage of urinary recovery were significantly increased (p less than 0.01) postoperatively. The patients had a mean (+/- SD) volume of the central compartment of 10.3 (+/- 2.3) L, volume at steady state of 18.3 (+/- 3.9) L, and elimination rate constant of 1.67 (+/- 0.63) h-1. Tissue concentrations of cefamandole were highest during the first hour after drug administration and were less than 1 microgram/g after 3.5 hours. Mean wound drainage concentrations ranged between 10 and 12 micrograms/ml during a dosing interval and dropped to 7 micrograms/ml 12 hours after the last dose. Intraoperative dosing of cefamandole is required to maintain subcutaneous adipose tissue concentrations greater than 1 microgram/g during procedures longer than three hours in morbidly obese patients. A postoperative dose of cefamandole 2 g iv q6h will provide sustained and therapeutic concentrations in the wound drainage of morbidly obese patients.

"input: Abstract: A retrospective review was conducted to assess the effect of molindone on weight. Monthly weights and neuroleptic dosages during the first three months of psychiatric hospitalization were compared between matched groups of patients receiving molindone, a combination of molindone and other neuroleptics, or other neuroleptic drugs. We found no significant differences in weight gain among the three groups. Our results challenge the common opinion that molindone can be associated with a lack of weight gain compared to other antipsychotics.

"input: Abstract: A national survey of dermatologists and pharmacists was conducted to characterize the involvement of the community pharmacist in the area of skin diseases and to elicit suggestions to improve professional interrelations. The results show the dermatologists' major complaint is pharmacists' inability or unwillingness to compound prescriptions. The study clearly indicates the need for increased communication between the two professions in matters such as inventory control, prescription refill procedures, and substitution guidelines. The pharmacists, in general, admitted a deficiency in their educational preparedness to recognize common skin disorders, thus limiting their ability to assess the severity of patients' complaints.

"input: Abstract: Ewes were treated systemically during the periovulatory period with the antihistamines diphenhydramine (H1-receptor antagonist) and(or) cimetidine (H2-receptor antagonist). None of the treatments prevented ovulation. However, the combination of drugs inhibited subsequent function of the corpus luteum (CL) as assessed by serum measurements of progesterone. Administration of antihistamines did not alter pituitary secretion of LH. Injection of small quantities of diphenhydramine and cimetidine into the antrum of the preovulatory follicle also caused aberrant luteal activity, but no blockade of ovulation. Intrafollicular injection of histamine reversed the inhibitory influence of antihistamines on the CL. Antihistamines suppressed preovulatory thecal edema and antral influx of plasma transudate containing LH. Thus, the effects of antihistamines appear to have been exerted at the follicular level. Function of matured CL was not compromised by peripheral administration of antihistamines. Actions of histamine within the preovulatory ovine follicle do not appear to be a prerequisite for ovulation, but apparently do have an impact on ensuing luteal function. We propose that a hyperemic reaction to histamine in preovulatory follicles enhances vascular filtration of LH. As a consequence, maximal permeation of the avascular granulosal layer of the follicle by LH leads to a normal luteinization response.

"input: Abstract: To determine the effect of decidualization on uterine immunoglobulins (Igs), we measured the levels of IgG, IgA, and secretory component (SC) after induction of artificial decidual cell reactions (DCR) in hormonally primed ovariectomized rats. When progesterone-treated (2.5 mg/day, 3 days) rats received an intraluminal instillation of oil or a needle scratch stimulation in one uterine horn, the stimulated horn had an increase in wet weight and cytoplasmic protein relative to the contralateral horn. Under these conditions, IgG levels increased 10-fold in the lumen of the stimulated horn. This response was selective for IgG, because induction of DCR had no effect on accumulation of IgA or SC in the stimulated horn. The progesterone-induced accumulation of IgG after DCR was further enhanced by estradiol. The addition of a small amount of estradiol (0.2 microgram) on day 3 of a 4-day progesterone pretreatment resulted in further increases in both the wet weight of the stimulated horn and the concentration of IgG in the lumen. The amount of IgG in the lumen of the stimulated horn was 5-fold greater than that in the stimulated horn after progesterone alone. Levels of IgA and SC, however, remained unchanged with this treatment. These results indicate that movement of IgG into the uterine lumen occurs as a part of the DCR and that both an appropriate endocrine balance and physical stimulation are essential for maximal IgG accumulation. Further, they suggest that IgG may play a central role in early pregnancy, which results in the successful implantation of the blastocysts.
