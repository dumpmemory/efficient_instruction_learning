"input: Abstract: As a means of providing defibrillation as soon as possible for those suffering out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation, numerous communities have trained and authorized emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to provide defibrillatory shocks (EMT-D). The findings of four controlled studies and the experience of various communities have answered important questions. EMT-D programs have been shown effective in urban, suburban, and rural communities with and without paramedic backup. EMT-D programs appear safe, with errors of commission being extremely rare and errors of omission being of acceptably low incidence. Issues still to be resolved include the degree and amount of training that should be given and whether manual or automatic defibrillators should be used. Medical supervision and quality control is the most important aspect of EMT-D programs. At its core, the success of EMT-D programs is confirmation of the principle of early defibrillation. Wider dissemination of early defibrillation will improve survival from sudden cardiac death.

"input: Abstract: There is controversy regarding the appropriate utilization of health care resources in the management of tricyclic antidepressant overdosage. Antidepressant overdose patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) are routinely admitted to intensive care units, but only a small proportion develop cardiac arrhythmias or other complications requiring such an environment. The authors reviewed the findings in 165 patients presenting to an ED with antidepressant overdose. They found that major manifestations of toxicity on ED evaluation (altered mental status, seizures, arrhythmias, and conduction defects) were commonly associated with a complicated hospital course. Patients with the isolated findings of sinus tachycardia or QTc prolongation had no complications. No patient experienced a serious toxic event without major evidence of toxicity on ED evaluation and continued evidence of toxicity during the hospital course. These data support the concept that proper ED evaluation can identify a large body of patients with trivial ingestions who may not require hospital observation.

"input: Abstract: Serum from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was tested by immunoblotting for reactivity against three muscle-derived preparations: denervated chick leg muscle extracts, media conditioned by denervated rat hemidiaphragms, and a human muscle extract. For each preparation, multiple bands were present using serum from all patients and controls, and no band was unique to ALS. Against rat muscle-conditioned medium, bands in the 56,000 (56K) molecular weight range were present to an equal degree in ALS and in controls; in addition, different bands near 56K were recognized by serum from different ALS patients. These results fail to confirm a recent report suggesting that anti-56K reactivity is characteristic of ALS.

"input: Abstract: A general approach to the child with foot pain has been described. In that the pediatrician is so often the recipient of parent's questions about children's shoes, he or she should be aware of problems relating to poorly fitting shoes, probably the most common source of complaints of foot pain in children. With a systematic approach, the pediatrician is very capable of managing the majority of such complaints.

"input: Abstract: Methylglyoxal bis (guanylhydrazone) (MGBG) is an inhibitor of polyamine synthesis. In vitro studies demonstrate the accumulation of some tumor cells in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Nineteen patients with advanced head and neck cancer were entered in a Phase II trial of MGBG. MGBG, 500 mg/M2, was administered as a brief intravenous infusion weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks. Dose modifications were based on cumulative toxicity after 2 weekly treatments. All but three patients had prior exposure to chemotherapy for disease recurrence. Of 17 patients evaluable for response and toxicity, one brief partial response was observed. The most common toxicities were mild to moderate nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomatitis. Myelosuppression occurred in three patients. Dose modifications were required in four patients; a maximum dose of 700 mg/M2 was tolerated. The results of four other Phase II single and combination chemotherapy trials of MGBG in head and neck cancer are reviewed. The single agent response rate in 59 patients was 22% (range, 6%-41%). The poor response rate observed in this trial was similar to that in other trials in which a heavily pretreated group of patients was evaluated. It is concluded that single agent MGBG is not a useful drug in heavily pretreated recurrent disease patients. However, because of its biochemical effects, further testing in combination with cycle specific agents and in larger numbers of patients with minimal prior treatment may be warranted.

"input: Abstract: Boerhaave's syndrome represents a diagnostic dilemma for the emergency physician. The prognosis of this truly life-threatening emergency is darkened by any significant diagnostic delay. Unfortunately, classic or expected symptoms and signs are frequently absent at presentation, a circumstance that leads to frequent misdiagnosis. Two cases of Boerhaave's syndrome with ""atypical"" clinical presentations are reviewed and discussed. It is clear that Boerhaave's syndrome should always be suspected in the evaluation of any sudden chest, abdominal, or back pain associated with emesis. However, emphasis should be placed on the fact that this entity may occur without emesis. The chest radiograph is the most helpful diagnostic aid. Undoubtedly, maintenance of a high degree of suspicion by the emergency physician for Boerhaave's syndrome will lead consistently to earlier diagnosis, and subsequent aggressive intervention should result in considerable reduction in rates of both morbidity and mortality.

"input: Abstract: Intraosseous infusions were widely used in pediatric patients during the 1930s and 1940s. Recent reports have re-introduced this concept and confirmed its safety and ready accessability for fluid and drug administration. However, these reports have not addressed the difficulties encountered during insertion of the intraosseous needle. Spinal needles, standard metal intravenous (IV) needles, and bone marrow biopsy needles have been suggested for intraosseous infusion. These needles were tested for ease of insertion on a pediatric cadaver leg. The site for needle placement was also evaluated during the study. It was found that the 13-gauge Kormed/Jamshidi disposable bone marrow/aspiration needle was the easiest to insert and did not plug with bone or tissue during insertion. An area proximal to the medial malleolus was found to provide a stable, relatively flat, and easily penetrable location for needle placement. This method was successfully utilized in ten pediatric and five adult patients. Intraosseous needle placement is a safe, rapid method to gain access to the venous circulation. By utilizing these techniques, a stable, usable fluid line can be established in even the most dehydrated pediatric patients.

"input: Abstract: The influence of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) on human detrusor and on pig detrusor, trigone, bladder neck and urethral smooth muscle was explored in a series of in vitro experiments. Serotonin evoked a dose-dependent and reversible contraction of the detrusor. The reverse response was triggered in trigone, bladder neck and urethral smooth muscle--a dose-dependent and reversible relaxation. The maximum amplitude of this relaxation was 85 +/- 15% of the relaxation produced by electrical nerve stimulation. The effect of serotonin was unaltered by blockade of ganglia, alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, cholinergic receptors and prostaglandin synthesis. The serotonin antagonists ketanserin, methysergide and cyproheptadine partly inhibited the effect of serotonin. The antagonism differed in potency on strips of different origin. The antagonists were ineffective or minimally effective in blocking responses to nerve stimulation. The effect of serotonin was probably mediated by specific serotonin receptors different from the serotonin-S2-receptors predominating in vascular smooth muscle. Serotonin is a potential neurotransmitter in lower urinary tract smooth muscle, but its importance in micturition physiology and pathophysiology is unknown.

"input: Abstract: Studies in patients on dialysis have shown that aluminum (Al) accumulation in bone plays a major role in the pathogenesis of osteomalacia. It has been suggested that deferoxamine (DFO) may be beneficial in the treatment of aluminum-induced osteomalacia. The present studies were performed in four groups of uremic rats to determine if DFO and/or discontinuation of Al administration have an effect on bone histomorphometry and blood chemistries. The groups were: 1) uremic control 2) aluminum (0.75 to 1.0 mg/rat i.p., five times a week for twelve weeks): 3) aluminum + DFO, after twelve weeks Al was discontinued and the rats received DFO (75 mg/rat two times a week for nine weeks); 4) aluminum + time, after twelve weeks Al was discontinued and the rats were sacrificed after nine weeks. High levels of Al in serum and bone and low levels of PTH were seen in rats receiving Al. Bone histology revealed Al at the mineralization front, abnormal tetracycline uptake, and an increase in osteoid. DFO treatment did not significantly change the level of Al in bone, however both DFO treatment and discontinuation of Al reversed towards normal the above described lesions. In conclusion, these studies suggest that DFO and/or discontinuation of Al administration to rats with approximately 30% of renal function greatly improve aluminum-induced osteomalacia.

"input: Abstract: We have developed a new cellulose membrane in which the active hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of the original cellulose fibers are masked with cationic synthetic polymers. The membrane was shown by in vitro and clinical tests to affect the activation of the complement system very little, and it retains the high dialysis efficiency, good tolerance to steam autoclave sterilization, and economical production cost characteristics of the original cellulose membrane. It thus appears that the new cellulose provides the optimum combination of qualities needed in a hemodialysis membrane.

"input: Abstract: The pharmacokinetics of atracurium were studied in infants and children anaesthetized with isoflurane and nitrous oxide in oxygen. There were no significant differences in volume of distribution (area) (139 v. 152 ml kg-1), clearance (5.1 v. 5.3 ml kg-1 min-1), T1/2 alpha (2.1 v. 2.0 min), or T1/2 beta (19.1 v. 20.3 min) between children with normal hepatic and renal function and those with moderately impaired hepatic function presenting for hepatic transplantation. There were significant differences in volume of distribution (area) (176 v. 139 ml kg-1) and in clearance of atracurium (9.1 v. 5.1 ml kg-1 min-1) between infants and children with normal excretory function. In infants the clearance of atracurium in ml m-2 min-1 (153 v. 133) tended to be greater and the T1/2 alpha and T1/2 beta tended to be shorter (1.0 v. 2.0 and 13.6 v. 19.1) than in children with normal excretory function; however, these trends did not reach statistical significance. Plasma laudanosine concentration was around 100 ng ml-1 greater in patients with liver disease than in normal children from 15-45 min following a bolus of atracurium 0.5 mg kg-1.

"input: Abstract: The use of atracurium during major abdominal surgery was assessed in 20 infants with hepatic dysfunction caused by biliary atresia. An initial dose of 0.6 mg kg-1 provided excellent intubating conditions in all patients. Subsequent neuromuscular blockade was monitored with a peripheral nerve stimulator and incremental doses of atracurium were given on reappearance of a single twitch. Neuromuscular conduction was allowed to return at the end of surgery and by careful timing of increments it was necessary to antagonize the neuromuscular blockade in only two patients.

"input: Abstract: The histamine releasing potential of equivalent bolus doses of atracurium 0.6 mg kg-1 or vecuronium 0.12 mg kg-1 was evaluated in 20 children anaesthetized with halothane. Blood samples were obtained before, and at 2 and 5 min after the administration of the neuromuscular blocker. The twitch response to 0.15 Hz was also evaluated. None of the 10 patients receiving vecuronium had a significant increase in plasma histamine concentration. In two of the 10 children receiving atracurium, the plasma histamine concentration increased markedly, but without any apparent clinical manifestations. Recovery of neuromuscular function (to 95% twitch height) after vecuronium 0.12 mg kg-1 was faster than after atracurium 0.6 mg kg-1 (P less than 0.02).

"input: Abstract: In 14 intubated, spontaneously breathing children with body weight (bw) ranging from 8.3 to 25.6 kg, the influence of midazolam 0.1 mg kg-1 i.m. (group M0.1, n = 7) and 0.2 mg kg-1 i.m. (group M0.2, n = 7) as premedication, on sedation, ventilation, ventilatory response to carbon dioxide and hormonal stress response was studied in connection with minor surgical procedures during halothane anaesthesia. The concentrations of catecholamines, ACTH and cortisol were measured immediately after induction, during undisturbed anaesthesia, during surgery and 15 min after the end of the surgical procedure. Sedation was better and plasma catecholamine concentrations during undisturbed anaesthesia were less in children receiving the larger dose of midazolam. During surgery and in recovery there were no differences in hormone concentrations. In recovery, the concentrations of all hormones were significantly greater compared with during undisturbed anaesthesia. During surgery, VE and respiratory rate were somewhat lower in group M0.2 while E' CO2 was similar. A dose dependent depression of the response to carbon dioxide was found. However, clinically, the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide after surgery was considered to be adequate in both groups.

Responses to supramaximal stimuli of the ulnar nerves were measured by a force transducer, and compared with visually observed movements of the contralateral thumb. For the 10 patients anaesthetized with nitrous oxide and enflurane, the second, third and fourth twitches visually reappeared at 84 (+/- 10)%, 76 (+/- 11)%, and 70 (+/- 12)% measured blockade, respectively. For the other 10 patients, anaesthetized with a narcotic-barbiturate technique, the second, third and fourth twitches reappeared at 81 (+/- 8)%, 68 (+/- 9)%, and 59 (+/- 11)%. These results were not different for the two anaesthetic techniques.

"input: Abstract: Twelve (34%) of thirty-five patients with an active infection on the palms or soles caused by Hendersonula toruloidea or Scytalidium hyalinum were found to have circulating antibodies to these organisms by counter immunoelectrophoresis or immunodiffusion, compared with 9% of uninfected controls. In every instance there was cross-reactivity between the positive patients' sera and the heterologous non-dermatophyte antigen. Using crossed and intermediate gel immunoelectrophoresis it was found that cytoplasmic extracts of H. toruloidea and S. hyalinum showed 34 and 41 precipitin peaks respectively, most of which were shared by both organisms. No cross-reactions were observed between the non-dermatophyte cytoplasmic extracts and hyperimmune animal antisera raised to Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton interdigitale, Aspergillus fumigatus or Candida albicans. Exoantigens prepared from the two non-dermatophytes showed similar cross-reactivity between the two species. It appears that H. toruloidea and S. hyalinum are very similar in antigenic structure, a finding which lends support to the view that they may be closely related. They are also antigenically distinct from other pathogenic fungi which commonly infect skin, a fact which may be useful in their cultural identification as well as their recognition in tissue specimens.

"input: Abstract: The effect of topical application of axonal transport blockers to the transected peripheral nerve was assessed by quantitating the strychnine-enhanced transsynaptic degeneration following transection of the inferior alveolar nerve in adult rats. Systemic administration of strychnine (1 mg/kg/day) for 7 days at the postoperational interval of 23 days proved to be suitable for quantitating the transsynaptic degeneration at the light microscopic level. When the proximal stump of transected nerve was treated with 2% colchicine immediately after transection, 5.8 +/- 6.8 dark neurons in a single section of the medullary dorsal horn, ipsilateral to the nerve transection, were observed. Following similar treatment with 0.4% vinblastine and 0.2% vincristine, 24.4 +/- 10.5 and 9.4 +/- 7.0 dark neurons were seen, respectively. When compared with 43.0 +/- 9.4 dark neurons, which were seen in animals without alkaloid treatment, colchicine, vinblastine and vincristine significantly reduced the transsynaptic degeneration by 86, 43, and 78%, respectively. Possible mechanisms involved in prevention of transsynaptic degeneration by the alkaloids are discussed.

"input: Abstract: The concentration of interferon-alpha was measured by a specific two-site immunoradiometric assay in a variety of fluids and tissues collected during human pregnancy. Maternal blood and blood and tissues from non-pregnant adults contained little or no interferon-alpha. Fetal blood, fetal organs, placenta, membranes, amniotic fluid and decidua all contained significant and roughly equivalent amounts ranging from 1.1 to 10 u/ml (or per g of tissue). These findings demonstrate that the fetus and its immediate surroundings are permeated with interferon. It is suggested that this may play a role in regulation of the maternal-fetal graft relation.

"input: Abstract: Random-dot stereograms were found to be capable of producing fusional vergence amplitudes in the absence of monocular contours. These vergence amplitudes are not an artefact of monocular contours provided by the target borders or test instrument and are comparable in range to vergence amplitudes measured clinically with second degree fusion targets in an amblyoscope. We conclude that diplopia of monocularly recognisable contours is not necessary for producing fusional vergence amplitudes.

"input: Abstract: Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) were generated that block two of the most important biologic activities of TSST-1, nonspecific T lymphocyte mitogenicity and the suppression of immunoglobulin synthesis. Fourteen hybridomas producing antibody against TSST-1 were isolated independently. The culture supernatant and ascitic fluids from each were analyzed to determine the mAb isotypes. Seven of the mAb were IgG1, and the remaining seven were IgM; all the mAb had kappa light chains. Immunoglobulin was partially purified from hybridoma-generated ascitic fluid by ammonium sulfate precipitation and tested for the ability to block TSST-1-induced mitogenicity and immunosuppression. Three mAb (all IgG1) were shown to block both the toxin-induced mitogenicity and the suppression. None of the mAb tested inhibited just one of the two toxin activities. The neutralizing mAb were then used in Western analysis with previously mapped cyanogen bromide (CNBr)-generated toxin fragments to localize the aforementioned biologic functions. The Western blot analysis showed that the mitogenic and the suppressive functions of TSST-1 were located on a 14,000 dalton internal CNBr fragment.

"input: Abstract: Sl/Sld mice have a defective hemopoietic microenvironment. It has been assumed, based upon previous studies, that the primary abnormality in these mice is simply lack of a necessary supportive or inductive material within the hemopoietic stroma. We used in vitro long-term bone marrow cultures to characterize further the nature of the hemopoietic microenvironmental defect in Sl/Sld mice. Sl/Sld mouse bone marrow cells consistently produced less than 10% of the total hemopoietic cells and multipotent and unipotent hemopoietic progenitor cells produced in cultures of marrow from normal, congenic +/+ mice. If fresh Sl/Sld and +/+ marrow cells were mixed prior to establishing long-term marrow cultures, there was a direct correlation between number of Sl/Sld cells added and degree of inhibition of +/+ hemopoiesis. A pre-established, confluent Sl/Sld adherent stromal layer inhibited hemopoiesis by fresh +/+ marrow cells by nearly 70%, as compared with dishes with irradiated +/+ or no stroma. This inhibitory effect was abrogated by irradiation of the Sl/Sld stroma prior to addition of the fresh +/+ marrow cells. Similarly, unirradiated, but not 9 to 200 Gy irradiated Sl/Sld stroma inhibited proliferation of the factor-dependent FDC-P1 hemopoietic progenitor cell line. Thus, the Sl/Sld hemopoietic microenvironment actively inhibits hemopoiesis in vitro, and this inhibition can be at least partially eliminated by irradiation of the Sl/Sld stroma.

"input: Abstract: Lymphocytes from 18 patients with the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Most peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal individuals are covered with slender microvillus projections, but a large proportion of lymphocytes from WAS patients were found to be relatively devoid of microvilli. A lymphocyte morphology scoring system was developed to quantify the density of microvilli: Grade 4 classified those lymphocytes with greater than 75% of the surface covered with microvilli with progressive decrements to grade 1, which were those without microvilli. The mean lymphocyte morphology score of eight normal individuals was 3.62 +/- .22. The mean lymphocyte score of WAS patients was substantially lower (2.89 +/- .27, P less than .001). In addition, WAS lymphocytes often were qualitatively abnormal, with short, blunted microvilli. These morphological criteria were used to diagnose WAS from the cord blood lymphocytes of one ""at-risk"" patient. Thus, WAS is the first primary immunodeficiency in which morphological abnormalities have been identified that can aid in diagnosis.

"input: Abstract: The ultimate cause of destruction of red blood cells (RBCs) after oxidative damage with Heinz body formation is not well understood. We correlated the changes in RBC morphology and membrane protein composition after oxidant treatment with the alterations in deformability of whole cells and cell membranes. The incubation of RBCs with phenylhydrazine concentrations of 0.3 to 100 mg/dL at 37 degrees C for one hour led to a dose-dependent formation of Heinz bodies, ranging from isolated Heinz bodies at 1 mg/dL to a confluent coating of the inner membrane surface at 100 mg/dL phenylhydrazine. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of a large quantity of hemoglobin bound to the ghost membrane of treated RBCs. Electrophoresis with and without dithiothreitol indicated that disulfide bridges are abundant between hemoglobin molecules and are also present among membrane proteins but are not the major bond between hemoglobin and membrane. Changes of spectrin, ankyrin, band 3, and band 6 and the appearance of a 260,000-dalton complex were also observed. With phenylhydrazine concentrations below 30 mg/dL, even in the presence of multiple Heinz bodies, the RBC deformability measured by filtration through 2.6-, 4.5-, and 6.8-microns pores and the membrane deformability determined by a filter aspiration technique were not altered. With 100 mg/dL phenylhydrazine, when the entire membrane was coated with Heinz bodies, RBC filterability and membrane deformability were drastically reduced. These results indicate that oxidative damage of RBCs with discrete Heinz body formation causes focal membrane rigidification but does not affect the global cellular deformability until the Heinz bodies nearly cover the entire cell endoface.

"input: Abstract: We have studied the hematology, hemoglobin composition, and globin gene arrangements in one young Turkish boy with a beta zero-thalassemia homozygosity and in 11 of his relatives. Evidence is presented that the chromosome with the beta zero-thalassemia determinant carries a gamma-globin gene quadruplication, perhaps in a -G gamma-G gamma-G gamma-A gamma-gene arrangement. The eight gamma-globin genes in this patient produced G gamma and A gamma chains in a 95 to 5 ratio, and nearly 99% of the patient's hemoglobin was of the fetal type. The clinical condition resembled that of a thalassemia intermedia. HbF levels in eight beta-thalassemia heterozygotes varied between 0.5 and 4.2% and the percentages of G gamma in this HbF averaged at 87% or 95%; this level is to some extent related to the haplotype of the normal chromosome. All subjects carried four alpha-globin genes; a new BglII polymorphism was observed within the psi alpha-globin gene.

"input: Abstract: The total sialic acid concent of retinoic acid (RA)-resistant or 6-thioguanine (6TG)-resistant HL-60 cells was more than tenfold lower and of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-resistant HL-60 cells was approximately twofold lower than that of parental, wild-type (wt) HL-60 cells. Neuraminidase-inaccessible, ie residual cell-associated sialic acid after neuraminidase treatment, was four- to twelvefold lower in the three differentiation-inducer-resistant sublines than in the parent line. Neuraminidase treatment of 125I-labeled surface membrane glycoproteins (SMGs) from wt HL-60 cells converted the two-dimensional gel electrophoretic pattern to one having features in common with RA- and 6TG-resistant cells. However, neuraminidase treatment did not alter the sensitivity of wt HL-60 cells to differentiation induction by RA, hypoxanthine (purine base), or DMSO. These results indicate that differences in peripheral, neuraminidase-accessible sialic acids are important determinants of the gel electrophoretic mobility of the SMGs of the HL-60 line and sublines but are not likely related to the differentiation-resistance mechanism. Further studies are required to determine if hyposialylation of cryptic, neuraminidase-inaccessible sites has functional significance.

"input: Abstract: A 26-yr-old woman presented with hirsutism, male pattern scalp baldness (""geheimratsecken""), and menstrual irregularities. She had no hypertension or other signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome. Plasma cortisol levels were greatly elevated and did not suppress normally in response to dexamethasone. Cortisol binding to transcortin was normal. Plasma androstenedione and testosterone levels were also increased, but 17-hydroxyprogesterone and aldosterone levels were normal. Further studies revealed an increased cortisol production rate, increased 24-h urinary cortisol excretion, increased plasma ACTH levels, a normal diurnal rhythm of cortisol at an elevated level, and normal increments of plasma ACTH, cortisol, GH, and PRL in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. The father and two brothers also had increased plasma cortisol levels, which did not suppress normally in response to dexamethasone. Chronic therapy with dexamethasone (at first 1 and later 0.5 mg, three times daily) for more than 30 weeks resulted in decreased hirsutism, normalization of scalp hair and menstrual cyclicity, and normal plasma testosterone and androstenedione levels. No signs or symptoms of Cushing's syndrome developed, and the central regulation of secretion of ACTH, cortisol, GH, and PRL (insulin test, diurnal rhythm) remained qualitatively normal at a lower set-point. We conclude that this patient had autosomal dominantly inherited hereditary (partial) cortisol insensitivity, which had resulted in increased adrenocortical cortisol and androgen secretion. The latter had not resulted in clinical symptoms in the three afflicted male members of the family, but had in the propositus. The results also indicate the potential usefulness of the insulin test in distinguishing this disorder from Cushing's disease.

"input: Abstract: The long-term health consequences of chronic physical activity for patients with type I diabetes are unknown. In the current study, the association of physical activity to diabetic complications was assessed in 696 type I diabetic individuals diagnosed between 1950 and 1964. Participation in team sports in high school or college was not associated with a decreased prevalence of severe retinopathy or blindness later in life. There was, however, a suggestion of a negative association between physical activity and both cardiovascular disease and overall mortality, ie, individuals who participated in team sports were somewhat less likely to report macrovascular disease at follow-up or to have died than nonparticipants. The relationship between physical activity and diabetic complications only appeared in male subjects. The results suggest that activity early in life by patients with type I diabetes does not appear to be associated with an adverse health effect and may, in fact, be beneficial.

"input: Abstract: Cells with mutations at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) locus may be detected in vitro by their resistance to the toxic effects of thioguanine. We have assessed HPRT mutants in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with connective tissue diseases who have been treated for long periods with cytotoxic drugs. The results from patients treated with cyclophosphamide were abnormal suggesting the presence of drug-induced mutations. The results from patients treated with chlorambucil or azathioprine did not differ from controls--either these drugs have not induced mutations or, more likely, the technique is not sufficiently sensitive to detect them. These possibilities are discussed. Specific mutations induced by cytotoxic drugs in patients with connective tissue diseases have not been previously recorded.

"input: Abstract: The effects of parental smoking on IgE and IgD levels in cord serum and subsequent infant allergy were investigated in an unselected series of 186 European newborn infants. Maternal smoking caused a significant rise in both IgE (p less than 0.05) and IgD (p less than 0.05), a finding that was most apparent in newborn infants with a negative biparental history of allergy (p less than 0.025 and p = 0.005, respectively). Furthermore, newborn infants of nonallergic parents had a more than threefold (p less than 0.01) higher incidence of elevated cord IgE (greater than or equal to 1.20 IU/ml) and a fourfold (p = 0.005) higher risk of developing definite or probable atopic disease before 18 months of age if the mother smoked than if she did not. Paternal smoking did not influence, in whatever the subgroup, cord IgE or subsequent infant allergy but increased cord IgD (p less than 0.001) among newborn infants with a negative family history even after controlling for maternal smoking (p less than 0.04). These results suggest that parental smoking in some way affects the fetal immune system, probably via substances in tobacco smoke. Maternal smoking in particular appears to exert a pronounced effect on the IgE system already in fetal life, predisposing even ""low-risk"" infants to subsequent sensitization, probably in synergy with a later acquired mucosal damage that would facilitate penetration of foreign matter. Pregnant women and mothers should be encouraged to try and give up smoking that might help to prevent allergic disease in their infants.

"input: Abstract: Thermal injuries lead to changes in both the cell-mediated and humoral responses of the patient. This study was undertaken to assess these responses in the post-burn period and also to see if bacterial infection altered these responses. It has been concluded that alterations in the cell-mediated and humoral immune responses following thermal injuries are altered by infection and consequently are also important in the healing process.

"input: Abstract: A retrospective epidemiological study of industrial burns admitted to the Royal Brisbane Hospital was conducted over a period of 7 years. A total of 182 patients were included in this survey--173 males (95 per cent) and 9 females (5 per cent). The proportion of industrial burns has decreased from 31.5 per cent to 18.5 per cent of total admissions to the burns unit over the past 10 years. Fifty per cent of the burns occurred in males less than 30 years old. The average age was 31 years. Two-thirds of the burns covered less than 10 per cent of the body and 84 per cent covered less than 20 per cent. While scalds were the commonest cause of industrial burns in our study (19.4 per cent), flame burns with clothing ignited caused the most extensive burns. Face and hands were the most common sites involved. Burns to these regions were mainly caused by flame and electrical burns. Eye burns comprised 5.5 per cent of the sample and were due to chemicals, gas explosions and electric flash. Twenty-six patients (14 per cent) suffered respiratory injury. Only one patient out of our series of 182 died. Progress has been made in industrial safety in the past few years but carelessness and human error still take their toll.

"input: Abstract: Because scald burns are reported to be the leading cause of burn injuries to children, little is written about other etiologies of burn injury in the pediatric literature. To test the hypothesis that burns from other etiologies are more serious and require longer hospitalizations than scald burns, a retrospective chart review was undertaken. The charts of all patients less than 16 years of age who were admitted to Harborview Medical Center Burn Unit in the years 1979 to 1984 were reviewed. Four hundred sixty-four children were admitted to the regional burn center during that time. We found that children under four years of age are at greatest risk for being hospitalized for thermal injury, that the burn most commonly occurs inside the home between 6 PM and midnight, and that scalds are the most common etiology for thermal injuries in children (54%). However, 46% of the burns resulting in admission to our burn center were from etiologies other than scald injury. There was no significant correlation between etiology of the burns and length of hospital stay, rate of infection, or need for excision and grafting. Thermal injuries to children from any etiology are serious; pediatric health care providers should be aware that children may be burned in a variety of ways and should direct some of their well-child visit time to the topic of burn prevention in the home.

"input: Abstract: The need for active range of motion in hand burns is obvious and through adapted games the patient's interest is aroused and provides an incentive for active participation in his/her therapeutic programme. All the games are for individual players, on different intellectual levels, and provide different active ranges of motion: for fingers, wrist, elbow and shoulder. Most of the games were made by a former patient, now retired, copied from games in the collection of the occupational therapist, and some of the games are of Israeli idea and manufacture. All the games can be gas autoclaved and therefore be used from patient to patient. The games also provide a much needed outlet for intellectual stimuli and distraction from the burns unit and all it signifies.

"input: Abstract: The electromagnetic spectrum consists of radiant energy that is classified according to specific wavelengths. Man is constantly exposed to a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, particularly to radiation in the ultraviolet, visible and infrared regions. The tissues of the eye and skin are particularly sensitive to the non-ionizing wavelengths of radiant energy. Although both tissues possess endogenous protective mechanisms to minimize the effects of such exposure, problems still occur due to the absorption of radiation. The cornea, lens and retina have been shown to be susceptible to damage from light in the ultraviolet, visible and infrared range. Part I of this two-part article examines the structures of the eye that are most susceptible to light damage; part II, which will be published in the next issue of the Journal, focuses on eye protection.

These symptoms, which had been intermittent at first, continued practically uninterrupted during the last 2 years. She was diagnosed as having superior oblique myokymia of the right eye. Adequate trials of oral carbamazepine, baclofen and phenytoin were unsuccessful in suppressing her symptoms. One year after her initial presentation, she underwent a right superior oblique tenectomy and a right inferior oblique recession. She eventually required a second operation on her other eye to cure her of an annoying diplopia on down-gaze.

"input: Abstract: After a retreat to an Oregon farm, 19 of 31 college students developed an acute gastrointestinal illness. Campylobacter jejuni infection was recognized in all the ill students and caused asymptomatic infections in three others. In total, 22 (88%) of 25 students who consumed raw milk for the first time became infected as compared with none of two who had not consumed raw milk. Among ten persons who chronically consumed raw milk, none was ill, a striking difference from the 76% attack rate among the 25 acutely exposed students. The quantity of raw milk consumed was directly related to the occurrence and severity of illness. Acutely infected students showed significant rises in C jejuni-specific immunoglobulins, whereas the low antibody levels seen in unexposed persons did not rise. In contrast, acute-phase serum samples from persons with chronic exposure to raw milk showed elevated antibody levels to C jejuni. These findings indicate that chronic raw milk consumption is associated with elevated levels of C jejuni-specific serum antibodies and with immunity to symptomatic infection.

"input: Abstract: A mandatory seatbelt use law, the first such law in the nation, became fully in force in New York State as of 1 January, 1985. We studied seatbelt use among drivers and front seat passengers involved in motor vehicle accidents for a 3-month period pre-legislation (Phase 1), and a 5-month period post-legislation (Phase 2), to determine if this type of compulsory law, providing civil fines of $50 for violators, changes seatbelt use behavior. The reported use rate among drivers rose from 21% pre-legislation to 47% post-legislation (p less than 0.01). The use rate among front seat passengers rose from 21% to 40% (not significantly different due to the small number of occupants recorded in this position). A highway survey (Phase 3) noted the use rate in New York City and surrounding counties to be 63%, a marked increase from the published pre-legislation value of 16%. We conclude that mandatory seatbelt use legislation is effective in significantly increasing seatbelt use and urge physicians to seek similar legislation in every state.

"input: Abstract: One hundred twelve patients who developed acute leukemia or a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after chemotherapy or irradiation for another malignancy were reviewed. The median time from initial therapy to development of secondary leukemia or MDS was 71 months (range, 7 to 331 months). The initial malignancy was hematologic in 43%. An MDS presentation occurred in 57 patients (51%), 55% of whom subsequently transformed to acute leukemia. Chromosomal abnormalities were documented in marrow specimens from 70 of 89 patients with analyzable metaphases (79%; 69% of the total group). Compared with 34 patients with metachronous secondary leukemia without prior chemotherapy or irradiation, those with therapy-related leukemia exhibited a significantly higher frequency of abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 (43% v 18%), and lower incidence of diploid karyotypes (18% v 50%). Chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities were also significantly higher in patients previously treated with alkylating agents, procarbazine, and nitrosoureas (72% to 83%), compared with those who had received cyclophosphamide-based regimens (29%), other chemotherapies (14%), or irradiation alone (29%). The median overall survival from diagnosis of the secondary leukemia or MDS was 30 weeks. Survival was significantly shorter for patients with acute leukemia compared with MDS presentation (21 v 45 weeks); in the latter category, it was similar whether evolution to acute leukemia occurred or not. Of 72 patients treated with antileukemia therapy, 29% achieved complete remission (CR). A multivariate analysis of prognostic factors demonstrated the cytogenetic pattern to be the most important characteristic determining remission rate and survival. Other important prognostic features were the morphologic presentation (MDS v acute leukemia) for probability of achieving remission, and patient age and marrow blasts percentage for survival.

"input: Abstract: Of a total of 1561 patients registered in the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS) as of May 1983, 78 patients (5%) were younger than 1 year of age. These infants did not differ from the older children (1-20 years of age) in male/female ratio, clinical grouping, or survival rates. Infants younger than 1 year of age had a significantly greater frequency of undifferentiated sarcoma, 18% versus 7% in older children (P less than 0.005). Infants also had a significantly greater proportion of cancers with botryoid pathology, 10% versus 4% in older children (P less than 0.005). When reviewed by the newly proposed IRS cytopathologic classification, there was no difference in pathologic types between the two age groups. Infants younger than 1 year of age had a higher rate of bladder-prostate-vagina primary tumor sites than older children, 24% versus 10% (P less than 0.05). In addition, infants tended to receive less of the prescribed doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy than older children, and to develop more toxicity to treatment than older children. Despite these differences, the overall survival curve for the two age groups appears to be similar. In contrast to Wilms' tumor and neuroblastoma, in which age (less than 1 year) is a favorable prognostic factor, age does not appear to be an important prognostic factor in rhabdomyosarcoma.

Before these procedures, 20 patients were diagnosed as Stage I, and 17 as Stage II. LAG was done for 30, and Ga-67 scans for 32, 25 of whom had both. Five patients (16%) were upstaged to Stage III or IV by Ga-67 scans. Only one (3%) had abnormal LAG findings, in whom Ga-67 scans also showed abnormal accumulation in the para-aortic region. Because of this low positive rate, LAG is not recommended for staging of WR-NHL.

"input: Abstract: Eighteen patients underwent computed tomography (CT) prior to total laryngectomy. In order to assess the accuracy of CT scanning in the evaluation of carcinoma of the larynx, CT scans were prospectively interpreted and the extent of the tumour was recorded. The tumour extent was evaluated on whole-mount histologic sections of the laryngeal specimens, prepared in the horizontal plane, similar to the CT scan. The results were compared to assess the ability of CT to identify tumour infiltration in the horizontal plane accurately. Based on these findings it is clear that CT has its influence on the T-staging and on the choice of treatment of laryngeal cancer, i.e. radiotherapy versus surgery.

Radiographic or ultrasound imaging techniques were not utilized during the biopsy procedure. Forty-nine of 55 biopsy attempts yielded sufficient tissue for histologic evaluation (89.1%). Transient gross hematuria not requiring intervention was the sole complication and was noted in 6 of 55 biopsy attempts (10.9%). Percutaneous renal biopsy can be performed safely in very young children and the success of the procedure is comparable to that in older children.

"input: Abstract: Traditional therapy for malignant pleural effusions includes thoracentesis or tube drainage with instillation of irritants to achieve pleurodesis. This can require a lengthy hospitalization, causes pain and discomfort, and has an appreciable failure rate. Because of these drawbacks, the authors used a shunting device to transfer fluid to the peritoneal cavity in 17 patients with malignant pleural effusions. Eleven patients had undergone previous therapeutic thoracenteses and three had chest tube placement with failed sclerosis. The shunt was a subcutaneous valved pump chamber with attached pleural and peritoneal catheters, which used manual compression to transfer fluid against the normal abdominal/pleural pressure gradient. Operative placement under local or general anesthesia was performed without complication. Five patients achieved minimal benefit, either because of moribund status or their inability to compress the pump effectively. In the other 12 patients, there was radiographic evidence of diminished or stabilized pleural effusion; respiratory symptoms were effectively palliated, and no further treatment for their effusion was required. Peritoneal dissemination of malignant cells has not been clinically detected. We feel that pleuroperitoneal shunting is a valid new method for treatment of malignant pleural effusions which can effectively palliate respiratory symptoms with low morbidity. Advantages include the absence of external tubing and the possibility for only a short hospitalization or even outpatient placement. Shunting is applicable for patients who are able to perform the requisite pumping and is particularly suitable for those with trapped lungs or who have failed attempted pleural sclerosis.

"input: Abstract: The importance of the once-obscure right ventricle is becoming evident. Even in disorders that primarily affect the left ventricle, the once-considered-passive conduit has proved essential for maintenance of normal cardiac output. In coronary artery disease, the function of the right ventricle is affected by both its circulation and the after-load placed on it by dysfunction of the left ventricle. In congestive heart failure, right ventricular function relates to functional capacity, whereas left ventricular function does not, and right ventricular ejection fraction is a useful prognostic guide in these patients. In mitral and aortic valvular disease, the role of the right ventricle is only now becoming evident, and the precise interplay of all factors has yet to be explained. In systemic hypertension, it is likely that the pulmonary circulation is affected by the same humoral factors that elevate systemic pressures.

"input: Abstract: When right ventricular failure prohibits separation from cardiopulmonary bypass, standard methods of increasing pulmonary blood flow should be employed, including correction of hypoxia and acidosis, volume loading, and inotropic support of the right ventricle. Infusion of pulmonary vasodilators--particularly low-dose nitroprusside--should be used if the pulmonary vascular resistance is elevated. If pulmonary blood flow remains unsatisfactory, systemic intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation should be employed. In refractory cases, right-atrial-to-pulmonary-artery bypass using the Bio-Medicus centrifugal pump is the recommended therapy for those centers that do not have the Pierce-Donachy pneumatic ventricular assist-pump available. For refractory right ventricular failure following the surgical repair of congenital cardiac defects in which the placement of right atrial and pulmonary artery cannulae is not technically feasible, use of high-frequency high-volume ventilation appears to be quite promising. Utilization of pulmonary artery counterpulsation or the creation of an atrial septal defect may also be lifesaving, but is not recommended as the therapy of choice.

"input: Abstract: RV and LV failure frequently coexist. Experimental evidence suggests that RV failure results from a primary insult to the right ventricle and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. LV failure results in an elevation of the left atrial pressure and thereby a reduction in the transpulmonary hydrostatic gradient. Because RV function depends on the contraction of the left ventricle, this contribution is reduced during LV failure. Treatment should be aimed first at restoring LV function. If RV failure persists and is not due to a simple mechanical problem, treatment of RV failure should be commenced. If volume loading, inotropes, and pH adjustments do not result in adequate RV output, a mechanical assist device should be considered. RHBP is the most powerful device, and it is capable of restoring systemic perfusion even when there is no residual RV function. Clinical results with this device have been most encouraging--most patients demonstrate improved RV function and a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance after several days of treatment, allowing them to be weaned from assist. However, this technique is very invasive and requires constant close attention. PABC is a simple but less powerful assist device. Experimental studies suggest that if RV function is not extremely depressed--cardiac output is greater than 50 percent of normal--PABC may be effective in restoring systemic perfusion to normal levels. Current results suggest that RHBP remains the gold standard for severe RV failure, but further clinical experience with PABC may more clearly define its role in the management of RV failure.

"input: Abstract: We used Doppler echocardiography to quantitate the changes in intracardiac blood flow velocities and right and left ventricular stroke volumes in 80 normal human fetuses from 19 to 40 weeks gestation. Blood flow velocity spectra across the aortic, pulmonary, tricuspid, and mitral valves were digitized to obtain peak velocities (m/sec) and flow velocity integrals. Aortic and pulmonary diameters were measured at valve level from two-dimensional echocardiographic images and cross-sectional area was calculated assuming a circular orifice. Ventricular stroke volume was calculated as the product of the cross-sectional area of a great vessel and the flow velocity integral through that vessel. The pulmonary arterial and aortic diameters increased linearly with gestational age (r = .82, r = .84), and pulmonary arterial diameter consistently exceeded aortic diameter. There was a positive relationship between stroke volume and gestational age: stroke volume increased exponentially from 0.7 ml at 20 weeks to 7.6 ml at 40 weeks for the right ventricle (r = .87) and from 0.7 ml at 20 weeks to 5.2 ml at 40 weeks for the left ventricle (r = .91). Similar results were obtained for right and left ventricular and combined cardiac outputs. In 44% of the fetuses it was possible to quantitate both right and left ventricular stroke volumes. There was a close correlation between right and left ventricular stroke volumes in these fetuses (r = .96) and right ventricular stroke volume exceeded left ventricular stroke volume by 28%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

"input: Abstract: To assess the best method of quantitating progression of coronary disease, we studied four measurements in 114 coronary segments from 35 medically treated patients from whom angiograms were obtained 5 years apart. Only stenoses of less than 70% that were visualized in nearly identical projections on both angiograms were evaluated. Vessel edges were measured by use of catheter calibration and an automated computer algorithm yielding two ""absolute dimensions"" (mean and minimum diameters) and two measurements (percent stenosis and atheroma area) that required a ""normal reference"" diameter. The coefficient of variation for repeated segment measurements was less for mean and minimum diameter than for percent stenosis and area of atheroma. The best measure of progression of coronary disease as determined by t test comparison of different methods was the change in mean diameter over time (6.7 +/- 14.1% decrease), whether calculated on a per coronary segment or per patient basis (p less than .001). Based on this measurement and its standard deviation of progression of coronary disease in this patient subset with relatively benign disease, it is estimated that 470 patients per group would be required for an interventional study to demonstrate a 33% reduction in disease progression (207 patients for 50% reduction) at a 95% confidence level and 90% power.

"input: Abstract: Coronary angioplasty was performed in 53 patients in whom unstable angina had reoccurred after 48 hr and within 30 days after sustained myocardial infarction. Single-vessel disease was present in 64% of the patients and multivessel disease in 36%. The preceding myocardial infarction had been small to moderate in size in the majority of the patients. The left ventricular ejection fraction was more than 50% in 80% of the patients. Forty-five patients were refractory to pharmacologic treatment; eight were initially stabilized but once again became symptomatic with light exertion. Angioplasty was performed in 35 patients 2 to 14 days and in 18 patients 15 to 30 days after infarction (average 12 +/- 7 days after infarction). The initial success rate was 89% (47/53). The success rate of the patients treated at 2 to 14 days was lower (29/35, 83%) than that of patients treated at 14 to 30 days (18/18, 100%) but did not reach statistical significance (p less than .06). There were no deaths related to the procedure. In four of the six failures, emergency bypass surgery was performed and two patients sustained a myocardial infarction. Furthermore, a myocardial infarction complicated the angioplasty procedure in two other patients; thus the overall procedure-related myocardial infarction rate was 8% (4/53). At 6 months follow-up 26% (14/53) of all the patients who underwent angioplasty had recurrence of angina, which was successfully treated with repeat angioplasty, bypass surgery, or medical therapy. There were no late deaths. Late myocardial infarction occurred in two patients. Thus the total myocardial infarction rate after angioplasty at 6 months was 11% (6/53 patients).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

One hundred ninety successful laparoscopic cycles were evaluated. In group I, 104 oocytes were obtained, of which 37% fertilized, but no pregnancy resulted; in group II, 81% of 324 oocytes were fertilized, with a pregnancy rate per embryo transfer (ET) of 22%; in group III, 82% of 309 oocytes were fertilized, with a 31% pregnancy rate; and in group IV, 91% of 69 oocytes were fertilized, with a pregnancy rate of 12%. Probability models indicated that there was a clear threshold in normal sperm morphologic features at 14%, with high fertilization and pregnancy rate in the groups with normal sperm morphologic features greater than 14%.

"input: Abstract: Therapy of elevated ventricular filling pressures in patients with dilated heart failure may be limited by concern that cardiac output will be further compromised. Twenty-five patients with severe symptoms and ejection fractions of 25% or less were studied to determine the lowest ventricular filling pressures that could be achieved with vasodilator and diuretic therapy while maintaining cardiac output. In 20 of 25 patients normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (PCWs) were achieved (mean 10 mm Hg compared with 30 mm Hg at baseline). Stroke volume was 60 vs 39 ml at baseline. Stroke work index was 30 vs 19 g-m/m2. For each patient, over the range of PCWs, stroke volume and stroke work index were maintained and were often maximal at the lowest PCW achieved. The upright position was well tolerated in patients with normal supine PCW. Normal filling pressures can be achieved in patients with congestive heart failure without compromise of cardiac output. While congestive symptoms should be improved, the feasibility and benefit of maintaining normal filling pressures over a long term must be established.

"input: Abstract: The afterload-corrected end-systolic volume index (ratio of end-systolic stress to end-systolic volume index [ESS/ESVI]) was previously useful in predicting outcome in patients with mitral regurgitation undergoing valve replacement. Therefore we tested ESS/ESVI together with standard hemodynamic variables as possible predictors of outcome in 39 patients with various valvular lesions who underwent valve replacement. Thirteen patients had preoperative mitral regurgitation, 16 had aortic stenosis, nine had aortic regurgitation, and one had mitral stenosis. Twenty-seven patients (group S) had a satisfactory outcome as defined by a return to NYHA class I or II together with a normal postoperative ejection fraction. Twelve patients who died, remained in class III or IV, or had a subnormal postoperative ejection fraction were deemed to have an unsatisfactory result (group U). Mean right atrial pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, end-diastolic volume index, end-systolic volume index (ESVI), and end-systolic wall stress were all greater in group U, whereas ESS/ESVI and ejection fraction were lower in group U. When these and other factors were submitted to stepwise discriminant multivariate analysis, ESS/ESVI and ESVI were the only independent predictors of outcome. However, when patients with mitral regurgitation (who might have biased the study) were excluded, discriminant analysis showed ESVI as the only independent predictive variable. We conclude that end-systolic indicators of ventricular function are superior to other standard hemodynamic variables in predicting outcome of valve replacement.

"input: Abstract: Guiding surgical therapy of ventricular tachycardia by preoperative endocardial catheter mapping necessitates improvement of the accuracy of localization of the arrhythmogenic site. We therefore used a new mathematical cineradiographic method during catheter mapping to compute the position of left ventricular arrhythmogenic sites relative to three anatomic reference points: the centers of aortic and mitral valve ostia and the left ventricular apex. To enable the surgeon to identify the position of the computed sites, a wire skeleton (one for each patient) representing a single or multiple arrhythmogenic site(s) relative to the anatomic reference points was constructed. This wire skeleton was inserted into the left ventricular cavity during surgery. Side branches of the device indicated preoperatively localized arrhythmogenic sites. Results in eight consecutive patients were compared with those of intraoperative simultaneous mapping of 64 endocardial sites. Sixteen morphologically distinct monomorphic ventricular tachycardias were mapped by catheter and 15 by intraoperative mapping. In 12 ventricular tachycardias an identical morphology was recorded during both techniques. The distance between arrhythmogenic sites localized with both methods was 1 cm or less in 11 of these 12 ventricular tachycardias and 2 cm in one ventricular tachycardia. These results indicate that endocardial catheter mapping combined with wire skeleton representation of computed positions of arrhythmogenic sites is reliable for guiding surgical therapy of ventricular tachycardia and since some of the ventricular tachycardias were inducible only during either preoperative or intraoperative mapping, both techniques have an additive value. In addition, the wire skeleton proved convenient during surgery by identifying the arrhythmogenic sites.

"input: Abstract: Although it is not clear why coronary occlusion and restenosis occur after successful coronary angioplasty, factors related to the procedure may influence early and late results. The possible adverse effects of a medial tear documented histologically and produced during balloon angioplasty of the common carotid arteries were studied in 30 fully heparinized (100 U/kg body weight) normal pigs. Scanning electron microscopy showed endothelial denudation and extensive platelet deposition in all dilated arterial segments. Visible macroscopic mural thrombus was present within an hour of the procedure in 29 (91%) of the 32 arteries that had a medial tear documented by histologic study; the tear produced an indium-111-labeled platelet deposition of 116.4 +/- 26.5 X 10(6)/cm2 (mean +/- SE) and total thrombotic occlusion in 2 arteries (4%). None of the 24 arteries without a medial tear had a thrombus, and the mean platelet deposition in that group was 7.0 +/- 0.5 X 10(6)/cm2 (p less than 0.0008). In 12 pigs scanned with a gamma camera, visible thrombus was associated with platelet deposition in excess of 20 X 10(6)/cm2 in 12 arteries, 9 of which had a positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram. Thus, arterial angioplasty causes deep arterial injury, which appears to be a major cause of mural thrombosis, heavy platelet deposition, a positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram and acute arterial occlusion. A positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram was always associated with macroscopic thrombus of at least 20 > 10(6) platelets/cm2 and underlying deep arterial injury.

"input: Abstract: Radiographic techniques used to quantify coronary blood flow all require bolus injection of contrast material, which markedly alters the flow being measured. Newer nonionic contrast agents have been shown to have fewer adverse hemodynamic, inotropic, and rheologic effects compared with ionic media and it has been suggested that they might not substantially affect coronary blood flow. Six dogs were instrumented with electromagnetic flow probes and subendocardial ultrasonic crystals. Intracoronary injections of iohexol (300 mg/ml iodine) were administered to establish a relationship between the dose and rate of contrast injection and the effect on flow and regional myocardial function. Two and 4 ml volumes of iohexol were injected at 3 ml/sec; 4 ml volumes were administered at 1 and 4 ml/sec. The 2 and 4 ml volumes decreased coronary flow by a mean of 31% (p less than .01) and 77% (p less than .001). The 4 ml injection at 1 and 4 ml/sec 77% (p less than .001) and 69% (p less than .001). The magnitude of the fall in flow was directly related to the dose, and the rate at which the flow nadir was attained was directly related to the rate of injection. Decrements in fractional shortening were temporally delayed by several beats compared with the flow changes and showed mean decrements of 19% to 29%. The effects on regional myocardial function were independent of contrast volume. However, the degree of dysfunction was more profound with slower infusion rates, suggesting that prolongation of contrast-induced ischemia was a major modulating factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Most of these schools have similar policies on use of a 380 total score as the passing level for the NBME Part I examination, allowing three attempts to pass the examination, interrupting a student's progress into the clinical curriculum upon failure of the examination, officially providing time for preparation for taking the test, and requiring students to pass the Part II examination.

"input: Abstract: Several conditions that contribute to drowning and near drowning must be considered in the treatment of near-drowned victims. Regardless of the cause, mechanical ventilation should begin as soon as possible and closed-chest cardiac massage should be administered when there is any question about the adequacy of cardiac output. After aspiration of either fresh or seawater, a large intrapulmonary physiologic shunt can occur, which requires aggressive mechanical ventilatory support to ensure adequate oxygenation and to return pulmonary function to normal. Near drowning is a multisystem disease and, while abnormalities of the lung and brain have been emphasized, definitive therapy must be tailored to each patient and must address all of the patient's needs.

"input: Abstract: Over the last two decades, emergency medical services in the United States have been greatly improved. Organization of prehospital providers of health care has improved the outcome of many patients, particularly the trauma patient and the acute cardiac patient. In Seattle as many as 40% of outside-the-hospital cardiac arrest victims with ventricular fibrillation have been saved when there is rapid delivery of basic life support by first responders followed by advanced life support by paramedics. Although these systems are growing and improving health care, many lack adequate medical control or physician involvement. Emergency medical service systems must have physicians involved in their management to meet their full capabilities. It has become apparent that four factors are critical in determining the ability to resuscitate an individual once a cardiac arrest has occurred: time to starting any of the rescue procedures, use of electrical defibrillation when indicated, use of epinephrine, and adequacy of the technique of basic life support, particularly the ventilation component. To provide defibrillation at the earliest possible time, defibrillation by first responders such as emergency medical technicians appears to be of benefit. With the advent of automatic and semiautomatic defibrillators, first responders and family members may also be able to defibrillate victims. The use of defibrillation by people with less training than paramedics, however, must be approached with caution to ensure that there is adequate medical control and that the individuals who use these devices are properly trained.

"input: Abstract: Pulmonary edema due to upper airway obstruction can be observed in a variety of clinical situations. The predominant mechanism is increased negative intrathoracic pressure, although hypoxia and cardiac and neurologic factors may contribute. Laryngospasm associated with intubation and general anesthesia is a common cause of pulmonary edema in children. However, only seven cases of pulmonary edema presumably due to laryngospasm have been reported in adolescents and adults. Five of the seven had other risk factors for upper airway obstruction, and in four, the diagnosis of ""laryngospasm"" could be explained by other factors. Patients with underlying risk factors for upper airway obstruction, such as a forme fruste of sleep apnea or nasopharyngeal abnormalities, appear to be at increased risk for the development of pulmonary edema in the setting of intubation and anesthesia. This form of pulmonary edema usually resolves rapidly without the need for aggressive therapy or invasive monitoring.

"input: Abstract: Artificial ventilation is a cornerstone of basic life support-cardiopulmonary resuscitation (BLS-CPR). Recent data corroborate clinical studies performed in the 1950s and 1960s, suggesting a need to change the present American Heart Association standards for artificial ventilation. These studies show that gastric insufflation followed by regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration are a major hazard of artificial ventilation with an unprotected airway. Present BLS-CPR standards require that ventilation be performed rapidly between external chest compressions or with incremental breaths. These methods of ventilation predispose the victim to gastric insufflation. Alternative methods of ventilation with longer inspiratory time and thus lower flow rate and peak inspiratory pressure are suggested. Additionally, rescue personnel, particularly EMTs and paramedics, should be taught how to apply cricoid pressure to prevent gastric insufflation in victims with an unprotected airway.

"input: Abstract: Paired maternal and umbilical vein blood samples were obtained from 15 women and the plasma antithrombin III activity and fibrinopeptide A concentration measured. Women with preeclampsia had significantly lower antithrombin III activities and higher fibrinopeptide A concentrations (P less than .05) than normals. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups of fetuses. Thus, thrombin generation was not increased in the fetuses delivered from preeclamptic women.

"input: Abstract: In a consecutive series of patients with knee complaints, tibial rotation consistently affected the interpretation of the Lachman test (passive anterior tibial translation in slight knee flexion). To perform the Lachman test correctly, the anterior tibial force must be applied posteromedially on the proximal tibia. This is best achieved by having the leg under examination on the same side of the bed as the examiner, and with slight external tibial rotation. Reaching across the bed to examine either leg can create either false positive or false negative Lachman results due to inadvertent tibial rotation (internal tibial rotation decreases translation) and inaccurate comparisons of the injured and normal legs. The importance of tibial rotation must be recognized if the Lachman test is to be used reliably and with maximum sensitivity.

"input: Abstract: In a prospective study of 295 infantry recruits during 14 weeks of basic training, 41% had medial tibial pain. Routine scintigraphic evaluation in cases of medial tibial bone pain showed that 63% had abnormalities. A stress fracture was found in 46%. Only two patients had periostitis. None had ischemic medial compartment syndrome. Physical examination could not differentiate between cases with medial tibial bone pain secondary to stress fractures and those with scintigraphically normal tibias. When both pain and swelling were localized in the middle one-third of the tibia, the lesion most likely proved to be a stress fracture.

"input: Abstract: Ninety-eight arthrotomy patients undergoing meniscectomy were given intraoperative intraarticular methylprednisolone (40 mg) or placebo using double-blind technique and were evaluated clinically at three days, two weeks, four weeks, eight weeks, and twelve weeks after operation. Patients who received methylprednisolone showed small but statistically significant accelerated rehabilitation time with respect to subjectively evaluated pain and range of motion, through two weeks after operation. After two weeks, there was no further advantage over placebo through 12 weeks of rehabilitation.

"input: Abstract: The authors present an in-depth clinical, radiographic, and pathologic analysis of a 62-year-old man with massive bone reabsorption around the proximal femur in a total hip arthroplasty (THA). The THA was revised 13 years after implantation. Thirty millimeters of calcar resorption was noted radiographically. Evidence of stem bending was present on examination of the femoral implant, and marked wear of the acetabular cup was noted. The pathologic evaluation of removed calcar bone and cement revealed a histiocytic mass invading the bone. Intracellular and extracellular polymethylene debris was noted within the invasive mass. Evidence of fragmented methylmethacrylate cement was also present. The bone-cement interface in the excised calcar region contained segments that showed active bone remodelling around the cement without an interposed membrane. It is possible that this case of calcar resorption began with histiocytic activation and recruitment by polyethylene wear debris followed by active bone lysis. The process may be perpetuated by the fragmentation of cement, as motion occurred at the calcar bone-cement interface, and may represent an extreme example of a process occurring in cases of calcar resorption in general.

"input: Abstract: The sciatic notch/acetabular index and its rule of thumb application was tested on two European skeletal series of documented sex. The results showed poor consistency between documented and estimated sex. Of the two variables comprising the index, it appeared that sciatic notch width was a particularly poor discriminator of sex. It is suggested that this may be due to differences in the relationship between sciatic notch form and body size in different ethnic groups.

"input: Abstract: Bilateral simultaneous Achilles tendon ruptures are rare, with only ten cases reported in the English literature. Our case is that of a 44-year-old woman, along with a review of the literature. Affected persons usually are on chronic steroid treatment and in the fifth to seventh decades of life. The patient may have concomitant systemic disease, and the injury occurs with relatively mild trauma. The goals of treatment are mainly preventative, i.e., cessation of steroids as soon as possible and protective bracing of the remaining intact Achilles tendon.

"input: Abstract: The pressure of pericardial constraint was measured in 20 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery (10 in Group I with normal cardiac size; 10 in Group II with cardiomegaly) using a catheter with a collapsible latex end balloon. Right atrial pressure and other hemodynamic variables including right ventricular stroke work index were also measured before and after the pericardium was widely opened. The pericardium was grossly normal in all patients and only small physiologic effusions were present. In Group I mean pericardial pressure was 8 +/- 2 mm Hg as was mean right atrial pressure. In Group II mean pericardial pressure was 6 +/- 2 mm Hg versus mean right atrial pressure of 10 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Excluding 2 of the 20 patients with outlying data, pericardial pressure showed linear correlation with right atrial pressure (r = 0.689). In Group I right ventricular stroke work index rose from 5.0 +/- 2.0 to 6.4 +/- 2.1 g-m/m2 (p less than 0.01) after pericardiotomy with no significant increase in mean right atrial pressure; similar findings in Group II were consistent with removal of external constraint. Thus, even in the absence of an abnormal effusion the normal pericardium exerts a significant pressure on the heart, which is often similar in magnitude to right atrial pressure. In certain notable exceptions, however, right atrial pressure far exceeds pericardial pressure. Such pericardial constraint has important implications for ventricular diastolic mechanics.

"input: Abstract: Sixty-five children viewed by their teachers as hyperactive were evaluated as to whether they would benefit from stimulant medication. All underwent extensive neurodevelopmental and educational testing. Additional information was obtained from school and parent questionnaires and interviews. Children were not placed on medication unless they demonstrated characteristic impulsive, inattentive, and/or overactive behavior in two of three environments (home, school, clinic). Fifty-two children (80%) were not placed on medication. Follow-up was completed in 80 percent, and 93 percent of these children were doing well with nonpharmacologic interventions. Initial comparison of children not placed and placed on medication revealed that age, race, SES, amount of resource help and retention could not distinguish groups. Children placed on medication had difficulties earlier in school (chi 2 = 4.88, p less than 0.05), weren't as delayed academically (chi 2 = 6.30, p less than 0.05) and had less neurodevelopmental disorders (chi 2 = 9.01, p less than 0.01). If a careful psychosocial history does not reveal impulsive, inattentive, and/or hyperactive behavior outside of school, a child should be evaluated to rule out neurodevelopmental and educational problems.

Two cases are reported of tracheal or bilateral foreign bodies in which the original chest x-rays were read as normal, but the history was suggestive of the foreign body aspiration. Early bronchoscopy can prevent the long-term morbidity that results from unrecognized tracheobronchial foreign bodies.

"input: Abstract: The purpose of the study was to compare the renal effects of low doses of exogenous dopamine to assess the responsiveness of renal dopaminergic receptors in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. Eight hypertensive patients and seven normotensive volunteer subjects were studied. Inulin and para-aminohippuric (PAH) clearances, natriuresis, and fractional excretion of sodium increased significantly after intravenous dosing with dopamine (2 micrograms/min/kg) in both groups. These increases were significantly higher in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects: 31.8% +/- 3.7% vs. 16.2% +/- 1.2% for inulin clearance (P less than 0.01), 83.3% +/- 10.5% vs. 41.1% +/- 3.4% for PAH clearance (P less than 0.01), and 331% +/- 38% vs. 216% +/- 26% for natriuresis (P less than 0.01). These findings suggest hyperresponsiveness to dopamine during hypertension. This enhanced response to exogenous dopamine can be considered as a further argument favoring the existence of a deficit in dopaminergic activity during hypertension. Dopamine also induced a significant reduction in blood pressure and increased heart rate in hypertensive subjects but no significant change in blood pressure and heart rate occurred in normotensive subjects.

"input: Abstract: Ten healthy male subjects were phenotyped with isoniazid for their acetylator status and then received intravenous amrinone at a dose of 75 mg during a period of 10 minutes. Blood samples were drawn at specified times during a 24-hour period after dosing. Plasma concentrations of amrinone were determined by a specific HPLC method. The plasma concentration data were fitted to a biexponential model by nonlinear regression. The mean apparent first-order elimination t1/2 for amrinone in the slow acetylators was 4.4 hours, whereas it was 2.0 hours in the fast acetylators (P less than 0.05). There was little difference in the volume of distribution at steady state. Clearance was lower in the slow acetylators, 16.6 L/hr, than in the fast acetylators, 37.2 L/hr (P less than 0.05). The AUC was higher for the slow acetylators, 4.96 micrograms X hr X ml-1, than for the fast acetylators, 2.20 micrograms X hr X ml-1 (P less than 0.01). Concentrations of amrinone and its N-acetyl metabolite in the urine from each volunteer were determined. The ratio of N-acetylamrinone to amrinone was calculated and, as expected, the fast acetylators had a higher ratio than did the slow acetylators (P less than 0.01).

"input: Abstract: The purpose of this study was to add to the limited information available regarding the pharmacology of ritodrine in the peripartum period when treatment fails and labor is not inhibited. Plasma or urine samples from eight parturients and 13 infants were studied; in addition plasma samples at delivery were obtained from a total of 26 mothers and infants. All the mothers received ritodrine in the 24 hours before delivery. Plasma and urine ritodrine (free and conjugated) were determined with HPLC by electrochemical detection. In maternal plasma, an apparent rapid distribution phase with a t1/2 of 32 +/- 21 minutes was followed by a prolonged equilibrium phase with a t1/2 of 17 +/- 10 hours. Seventy-six percent of the ritodrine excreted by the mother was in the form of a conjugate. Ninety percent of the ritodrine excreted by the neonate was also excreted in the form of a conjugate.

"input: Abstract: These studies examined regulation of superficial proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) transport as a function of length. When single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) increased from 28.7 +/- 0.7 nl/min in hydropenia to 41.5 +/- 0.4 nl/min in euvolemia, bicarbonate, chloride, and water reabsorption in the early (1st mm) PCT increased proportionally: from 354 +/- 21 peq/mm X min, 206 +/- 55 peq/mm X min, and 5.9 +/- 0.4 nl/mm X min to 520 +/- 12 peq/mm X min, 585 +/- 21 peq/mm X min, and 10.1 +/- 0.4 nl/mm X min, respectively. These high transport rates did not increase further, however, when SNGFR went to 51.2 +/- 0.7 or 50.7 +/- 0.6 nl/min after atrial natriuretic factor or glucagon administration. Anion and water transport rates in the late PCT were lower and exhibited less flow dependence. During chronic metabolic alkalosis, acidification was inhibited in the late but not early PCT. In conclusion, the early PCT is distinguished from the late PCT by having high-capacity, flow-responsive but saturable, anion- and water-reabsorptive processes relatively unaffected by alkalemia.

"input: Abstract: A variety of effective drugs are available for the treatment of schizophrenia. Knowledge of the side-effect spectrum of the various classes of antipsychotic drugs is necessary for the clinician to arrive at a rational choice of medication. In general, the preferred drug will be a high-potency neuroleptic. The following basic principles of clinical psychopharmacology should be followed: Consider risk and benefits; clinical experience is prerequisite; establish the diagnosis; select the appropriate class of psychotropic drug for the primary diagnosis; within drug class, the drugs are usually equally effective for patients with the diagnosis; give a dose that is high enough to be effective; choose target symptoms that can be monitored to indicate when to stop or increase the drug; avoid use of multiple drugs when possible; drugs are only one element in a comprehensive treatment strategy. Other modalities need equally careful consideration, e.g., psychotherapy, group therapy, family treatment, and vocational rehabilitation; and consultation with other subspecialists should be sought readily when indicated.

"input: Abstract: Skin disorders were reported in 33% of catering staff and 35% of women cleaners who returned a questionnaire, and were employed in a large hospital. Hand dermatitis occurred in 15% of the caterers and 12% of the cleaners. In the majority, the dermatitis was irritant in origin and related to their wet work occupations. Cleaners had a high prevalence of jewellery dermatitis. Limited patch testing revealed a majority positive to nickel, but a third were negative, indicating that jewellery reactions often but not invariably predict nickel sensitivity. Few subjects were atopic, but some psoriatic patients with hand problems were encountered. Most workers were able to carry on in their occupations despite having hand dermatitis.

"input: Abstract: Sebaceous wax esters and epidermal acylceramides were isolated from skin surface lipid obtained from children and from young adults. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were prepared from the esterified fatty acids of these lipid classes and analyzed to ascertain the proportions of methyl linoleate (18:2 delta 9,12), methyl sebaleate (18:2 delta 5,8), and methyl sapienate (16:1 delta 6). On the same subjects, 2 measures of sebum secretion rate were obtained, namely the sustainable wax ester secretion rate (WESR) on the forehead and the ratio of wax esters/(cholesterol + cholesterol esters) [WE/(CH + CE)] in the surface lipid. The proportions of methyl linoleate in FAME from the wax esters decreased, and the proportions of methyl sebaleate increased, with increased rates of sebum secretion. For both methyl linoleate and methyl sebaleate, a better correlation was obtained when the ratio of WE/(CH + CE) was used as a measure of sebum secretion rather than the WESR. The proportions of methyl linoleate in the FAME from the acylceramides were also inversely related to ratios of WE/(CH + CE). In acylceramides, linoleate was replaced by sapienate, a major fatty acid of human sebum. It appears, therefore, that sebum fatty acid composition may change with changes in sebaceous gland activity, and that sebum fatty acids can enter the epidermis and be incorporated into epidermal lipids.

"input: Abstract: The total cobalt and nickel concentration of 11 brands of Asian cement ranged from 8.1 to 14.2 micrograms/g and 14.9 to 28.5 micrograms/g, respectively. These metals exist mainly as insoluble salts; the water-soluble concentration of cobalt and nickel in the cements ranged from 0.39 to 0.65 micrograms/g and from 0-1.2 micrograms/g, respectively. 1.5% (4/272) of construction workers in a prefabrication construction factory had cobalt sensitivity. All had allergic contact dermatitis from chromate in cement. No worker had isolated cobalt sensitivity and cement dermatitis. It appeared that sensitization to cobalt in cement occurs only secondarily to an existing cement dermatitis. 1.8% (5/272) workers had nickel sensitivity: 2 with allergic contact dermatitis to nickel in their watches, 2 were asymptomatic and 1 had allergic contact dermatitis to chromate and cobalt in cement. The low prevalence of cobalt and nickel sensitivity from cement was probably related to the low concentration of soluble cobalt and nickel salts in the cement. However, these insoluble salts can form soluble complexes with body fluids on eczematous skin and sensitize the skin.
