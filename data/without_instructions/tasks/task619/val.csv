"input: Abstract: During the 17 years preceding March 1985, 140 patients sustained lightning injuries caused by 44 thunderbolts. Fifty patients showed evidence of current flow through their bodies. These 50 victims were classified into two groups, the first consisting of 9 victims who showed rupture of their clothes or linear superficial dermal burns along their whole bodies from head to feet, indicating the occurrence of surface flashovers. The remaining 41 patients showed no evidence of this flash effect. It is noteworthy that in the first group 5 of the 9 survived, whereas in the second group only 6 among 41 survived. The result indicates that when a flashover occurs along the whole body, the probability of survival is higher than 50 per cent. The conditions which determine death or survival were investigated experimentally, imposing artificial lightning voltage impulses on rats and developing flashovers on them. The rats survived when the voltage drop caused by flashover occurred immediately after the peak point, and the current waveform exhibited a sharp peak. In contrast, the rats were killed when the voltage drop caused by flashover was delayed by more than 20 microseconds, and the current waveform showed a blunt cone shape. It has been concluded that a fast flashover appreciably diminishes the energy dissipation within the body and consequently results in survival.
output: ",Lightning injury caused by discharges accompanying flashovers--a clinical and experimental study of death and survival.
"input: Abstract: Pillars of calcification are rarely found in the skin. An interesting case is described where rows of new bone developed in the skin which had been grafted 31 years previously to cover partial skin thickness burns of the shin. The problems of heterotropic ossification are discussed.
output: ",Calcinosis cutis--a rare late complication of burns.
"input: Abstract: A patient with a vesico-enteric fistula was successfully treated with resection of the small intestine and dome of the bladder and drainage of the intervening abscess. A search of the literature reveals this to be a very unusual complication of high-voltage electrical injury.

"input: Abstract: The need for active range of motion in hand burns is obvious and through adapted games the patient's interest is aroused and provides an incentive for active participation in his/her therapeutic programme. All the games are for individual players, on different intellectual levels, and provide different active ranges of motion: for fingers, wrist, elbow and shoulder. Most of the games were made by a former patient, now retired, copied from games in the collection of the occupational therapist, and some of the games are of Israeli idea and manufacture. All the games can be gas autoclaved and therefore be used from patient to patient. The games also provide a much needed outlet for intellectual stimuli and distraction from the burns unit and all it signifies.
output: ",The use of games in occupational therapy of hand burns.
"input: Abstract: The electromagnetic spectrum consists of radiant energy that is classified according to specific wavelengths. Man is constantly exposed to a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, particularly to radiation in the ultraviolet, visible and infrared regions. The tissues of the eye and skin are particularly sensitive to the non-ionizing wavelengths of radiant energy. Although both tissues possess endogenous protective mechanisms to minimize the effects of such exposure, problems still occur due to the absorption of radiation. The cornea, lens and retina have been shown to be susceptible to damage from light in the ultraviolet, visible and infrared range. Part I of this two-part article examines the structures of the eye that are most susceptible to light damage; part II, which will be published in the next issue of the Journal, focuses on eye protection.
output: ",The potential damaging effects of light on the eye (Part I).
"input: Abstract: We have developed a variable suction system for irrigation, aspiration and vitrectomy. The system is regulated by the operator's finger-tip.
output: ",A new variable suction system with finger-tip control.
"input: Abstract: Supramaximal medial and lateral rectus surgery was performed to correct horizontal deviations in seven cases of sixth nerve palsy and three cases of third nerve palsy, with satisfactory results in most cases. The advantages and disadvantages of such procedures are discussed.
output: ",Supramaximal horizontal rectus surgery in the management of third and sixth nerve palsy.
"input: Abstract: Nerve fibre bundle visual field defects are the hallmark of pathology at the optic nerve head or retina. In the present series, six eyes of four patients with large intracranial mass lesions demonstrated such field defects with visual acuity spared in three of the involved eyes. In no cases did visual function in the opposite eye offer a clue to the localization of the lesion.
output: ",Nerve fibre bundle visual field defects and intracranial mass lesions.
"input: Abstract: A 56-year-old woman presented with a 10-year history of torsional diplopia and right monocular oscillopsia. These symptoms, which had been intermittent at first, continued practically uninterrupted during the last 2 years. She was diagnosed as having superior oblique myokymia of the right eye. Adequate trials of oral carbamazepine, baclofen and phenytoin were unsuccessful in suppressing her symptoms. One year after her initial presentation, she underwent a right superior oblique tenectomy and a right inferior oblique recession. She eventually required a second operation on her other eye to cure her of an annoying diplopia on down-gaze.
output: ",Superior oblique myokymia: when treatment is necessary.
"input: Abstract: The authors report on the first case of signet-ring cell lymphoma involving the orbit. This variant of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma contains either vacuolated or eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions that squeeze the nucleus to one side of the cell. In this case, the inclusions were eosinophilic and stained positively for PAS, immunoglobulin M (IgM) heavy chain and kappa light chain. Electron microscopy showed granular electron-dense material trapped within distended loops of rough endoplasmic reticulum. Twenty-two cases of signet-ring cell lymphoma previously reported elsewhere in the body are reviewed, and their clinical significance is discussed.
output: ",Signet-ring cell lymphoma in the orbit: a case report and review.
