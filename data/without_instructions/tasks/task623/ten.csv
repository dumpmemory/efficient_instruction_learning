"input: Abstract: A case of an unusual caustic ingestion involving Compound W, an over the counter wart remover is presented. Chemical burns of the tongue, pharynx and larynx developed. The active ingredient in this preparation: salicylic acid in a flexible collodion vehicle produces caustic injury through a keratolytic action, which may be enhanced by the presence of collodion.

"input: Abstract: Our results suggest that ethylene oxide retention after sterilization is increased in cuprammonium cellulose plate dialyzers containing potting compound. In contrast, cuprammonium cellulose plate dialyzers without potting compound were characterized by a rapid disappearance of retained ethylene oxide after sterilization. Whether these findings explain the low incidence of SARD with cuprammonium cellulose plate dialyzers that do not contain potting material is a matter for continued study and experimentation.

"input: Abstract: Calcium carbonate appears to be as effective as aluminum hydroxide in binding dietary phosphorus in hemodialysis patients. The long-term safety of this medication appears acceptable in view of today's therapeutic options.

"input: Abstract: Based on our preliminary studies and the results of this study, we conclude that argon laser welding of 4-8 mm internal diameter veins, arteries, and arteriovenous fistulas may have several potential advantages compared to conventional suture techniques. The benefits of laser repairs may include improved mechanical properties, and absence of the foreign body response related to sutures. Laser welding is sterile, nontactile and possibly time conserving, and the wounds heal rapidly without aneurysms or excess tissue proliferation.

"input: Abstract: The System 7 pump/actuator/engine combination has demonstrated biologic compatibility and physiologic effectiveness and responsiveness in five TVAS in vivo studies. The recent 75-day implant supports the feasibility of extended reliability of the system components. Postoperative system maintenance was necessary only because of the nonhermetic design of System 7. However, the ability to pump 11 l/min at 120 beats/min, synchronize at beat rates of 144 beats/min, and pump against mean arterial pressures of more than 150 mmHg while maintaining hematologic and biochemical values within physiologic range sets a very optimistic stage for System 8 hardware. A System 8 concept is shown in Figure 14. The System 8 hardware will include a thermal salt package capable of providing completely untethered circulatory support for a nominal 8-h period. Recharge will be accomplished with a transcutaneous transformer in 1 h. Thermal management problems become minimal, with an average energy input of 15.8 W (peak of 24.9 W). The human preclinical testing of System 8 will start in 1988.

"input: Abstract: The roller screw electric VAD is easier to manufacture and 25% lighter than the previously described drum cam model. This device requires 12 to 15 W to pump 6 to 8 l/min with minimal hemolysis. The motor drive has functioned for periods up to 93 days in vivo with no measurable wear. The compliance chamber volume varies by 100 cc during VAD function but does so while maintaining pressure variations below 15 mmHg. Compliance chamber volume loss of 2 to 5 cc/day is explained by gas transport through SPU. The subcutaneous sampling port provides ready access to the sealed system.

"input: Abstract: This study demonstrates that 20 to 30 microns porous, Replamineform silicone rubber prostheses remain isocompliant with adjacent arterial segments up to 8 months following implantation. This finding contrasts with the results of currently available prostheses, including autologous vein, which rapidly become minimally compliant. We conclude that this vascular construction is stable over the long-term following implantation and may improve the success of small internal diameter arterial reconstruction by eliminating failures caused by intimal hyperplasia.

"input: Abstract: To summarize the results: Bilirubin removal by hemoperfusion was successfully performed for the first time on a premature infant. The hemoperfusion caused no adverse effects on the clinical state of the infant. The bilirubin removed in 90 min--13 mg--indicates the existence of a large extravascular pool. Hemoperfusion is suggested for bilirubin removal from newborn babies, reducing the need for blood exchange with bank blood.

"input: Abstract: We have developed a new cellulose membrane in which the active hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of the original cellulose fibers are masked with cationic synthetic polymers. The membrane was shown by in vitro and clinical tests to affect the activation of the complement system very little, and it retains the high dialysis efficiency, good tolerance to steam autoclave sterilization, and economical production cost characteristics of the original cellulose membrane. It thus appears that the new cellulose provides the optimum combination of qualities needed in a hemodialysis membrane.

"input: Abstract: The pharmacokinetics of atracurium were studied in infants and children anaesthetized with isoflurane and nitrous oxide in oxygen. There were no significant differences in volume of distribution (area) (139 v. 152 ml kg-1), clearance (5.1 v. 5.3 ml kg-1 min-1), T1/2 alpha (2.1 v. 2.0 min), or T1/2 beta (19.1 v. 20.3 min) between children with normal hepatic and renal function and those with moderately impaired hepatic function presenting for hepatic transplantation. There were significant differences in volume of distribution (area) (176 v. 139 ml kg-1) and in clearance of atracurium (9.1 v. 5.1 ml kg-1 min-1) between infants and children with normal excretory function. In infants the clearance of atracurium in ml m-2 min-1 (153 v. 133) tended to be greater and the T1/2 alpha and T1/2 beta tended to be shorter (1.0 v. 2.0 and 13.6 v. 19.1) than in children with normal excretory function; however, these trends did not reach statistical significance. Plasma laudanosine concentration was around 100 ng ml-1 greater in patients with liver disease than in normal children from 15-45 min following a bolus of atracurium 0.5 mg kg-1.
