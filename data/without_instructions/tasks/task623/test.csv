"input: Abstract: The use of atracurium during major abdominal surgery was assessed in 20 infants with hepatic dysfunction caused by biliary atresia. An initial dose of 0.6 mg kg-1 provided excellent intubating conditions in all patients. Subsequent neuromuscular blockade was monitored with a peripheral nerve stimulator and incremental doses of atracurium were given on reappearance of a single twitch. Neuromuscular conduction was allowed to return at the end of surgery and by careful timing of increments it was necessary to antagonize the neuromuscular blockade in only two patients.

"input: Abstract: Six patients with bowenoid papulosis and two patients with Bowen's disease of the genital area were treated by means of an argon, Nd:YAG, and CO2 laser. In all of the patients, complete resolution of the lesions was achieved. Due to a superficial coagulating effect, application of the argon laser should be restricted to macular and papular pigmented lesions. In contrast, Nd:YAG and CO2 lasers could be used even for treatment of extensive leukoplakia-like and verrucous lesions. Advantages and disadvantages of these two lasers are discussed.

"input: Abstract: A behavioural method of habit reversal, in combination with a hydrocortisone cream, was compared with the use of cream alone in the treatment of 17 patients with atopic dermatitis. The patients were assigned randomly to two groups, one of which received the combination treatment and the other regular ointment treatment. The patients' skin status was assessed before and after treatment, and the patients recorded their scratching during the study. Both groups improved, but the group which received habit-reversal therapy improved significantly more. A strong correlation was found between reduction in scratching and improvement in skin status.

"input: Abstract: The lifetime prevalence of psychiatric illness was determined in 114 patients with diabetes mellitus (types I and II) who were selected randomly from patients undergoing diabetes evaluations at a large medical center. The relationship of psychiatric illness to diabetic control was studied using glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1) and self-report measures of metabolic symptoms. Seventy-one percent of the patients had a lifetime history of at least one criteria-defined psychiatric illness; affective and anxiety disorders were the most common diagnoses. A significant difference (p = .02) in mean glycosylated hemoglobin levels was observed comparing patients with a recent psychiatric illness (mean = 10.8%) to those never psychiatrically ill (mean = 9.6%). These psychiatrically ill patients also reported more symptoms of poor metabolic control and more distress associated with these symptoms than did patients never psychiatrically ill (p less than .0001 for both). The overall report of diabetes symptoms was unrelated to HbA1 (p = .25) and was influenced primarily by the recent presence of psychiatric disorder (p less than .0001). We conclude that emotional illness is associated with both poorer metabolic control and the increased report of clinical symptoms of diabetes.

"input: Abstract: Active forms of vitamin D3, 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, were administered in an open-design study to 40 patients with psoriasis vulgaris in three ways: to 17 patients 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 was given orally at a dose of 1.0 micrograms/day for 6 months, to four patients 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was given orally at a dose of 0.5 microgram/day for 6 months, and 19 patients were given 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 applied topically at concentration of 0.5 microgram/g of base for 8 weeks. Improvement was observed at the end of the individual study periods in 13 (76%) patients in Group 1 with a mean period of treatment (+/- SD) of 2.7 +/- 0.6 months, in one patient in Group 2 at 3 months after the start of treatment, and in 16 (84%) patients in Group 3 when the chemical was applied for 3.3 +/- 1.2 weeks. No side-effects were observed in any of these trials. These data suggest that psoriasis may respond to active metabolites of vitamin D3 and that abnormalities in vitamin D metabolism or in responsiveness of the skin cells to active metabolites of vitamin D may be involved in the pathogenesis of this skin disease.

"input: Abstract: Multivariate analysis on an unselected patient population consisting of all 253 children treated for neuroblastoma in Denmark during 1943 to 1980 shows that stage, age, and treatment given are independent prognostic variables. Calendar year of diagnosis, sex of the patient, and site of primary tumor were not significant prognostic factors. Further analysis shows that multimodal treatment with surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, especially in patients older than 1 year of age with Stage II disease, has influenced the survival significantly. The fact that age at diagnosis and the administration of chemotherapy have independent prognostic significance can be explained by the theory that all neuroblastomas are virtually congenital; therefore, the difference in age at diagnosis largely reflects the difference in growth rates of the tumor. Thus, according to this theory, age may be a measure of the probability of micrometastases in addition to the clinical extent or stage of the disease, as it represents the duration of the disease. Additional chemotherapy may thus have eradicated these micrometastases in the older children, since the age influence on Stage II disease disappeared when multimodal treatment was given in this study. The implications for treatment policy are discussed in view of this theory.

"input: Abstract: Cell cultures of human keratinocytes contain membrane-associated thioredoxin reductase that is extremely active in reducing radicals on the outer plasma membrane. This enzyme activity was confirmed by its purification from cultures of stratified human keratinocytes by affinity column chromatography. The enzyme was assayed both in vivo and in vitro using a spin-labeled quaternary ammonium compound as the substrate, under saturating conditions in free radical substrate. Specific activities were determined by monitoring the sequential decrease in the amplitude of the electron spin resonance signal per unit of cell protein. The following properties were found: Cultures of adult stratified cells have approximately twice the thioredoxin reductase activity of neonatal cells. The enzyme is inhibited by thioprotein inhibitors (i.e., parachloromecuribenzoate and dinitrochlorobenzene). The activity is regulated by calcium concentrations of the cell culture medium. Stratified keratinocytes are half as active in medium containing 2 mM Ca++ compared with 0.1 mM Ca++ concentration. Product inhibition of the enzyme occurs with oxidized coenzyme NADP+ (i.e., 87% inhibition of enzyme activity over 30 min). The enzyme is heat stable at temperatures of 70 degrees C for 10 min. It is inactivated at 75 degrees C. A comparative study of thioredoxin reductase activity on stratified differentiated and undifferentiated rapidly growing cells was performed. Also, enzyme activity was quantitated for cultured keratinocytes isolated from vitiliginous and normal skin of the same donor. The results of this study, and the connection between this enzyme activity and UV-generated free radicals are reconciled in terms of the mechanism of action and metabolic activity of thioredoxin reductase.

The majority of burns were domestic and fire was the predominant cause. The most vulnerable areas were the arms and the legs, and small children still have the highest incidence of thermal injury. As predisposing factors were of significance in several accidents, the importance of further prevention is stressed.

"input: Abstract: Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) were generated that block two of the most important biologic activities of TSST-1, nonspecific T lymphocyte mitogenicity and the suppression of immunoglobulin synthesis. Fourteen hybridomas producing antibody against TSST-1 were isolated independently. The culture supernatant and ascitic fluids from each were analyzed to determine the mAb isotypes. Seven of the mAb were IgG1, and the remaining seven were IgM; all the mAb had kappa light chains. Immunoglobulin was partially purified from hybridoma-generated ascitic fluid by ammonium sulfate precipitation and tested for the ability to block TSST-1-induced mitogenicity and immunosuppression. Three mAb (all IgG1) were shown to block both the toxin-induced mitogenicity and the suppression. None of the mAb tested inhibited just one of the two toxin activities. The neutralizing mAb were then used in Western analysis with previously mapped cyanogen bromide (CNBr)-generated toxin fragments to localize the aforementioned biologic functions. The Western blot analysis showed that the mitogenic and the suppressive functions of TSST-1 were located on a 14,000 dalton internal CNBr fragment.

"input: Abstract: Therapy of elevated ventricular filling pressures in patients with dilated heart failure may be limited by concern that cardiac output will be further compromised. Twenty-five patients with severe symptoms and ejection fractions of 25% or less were studied to determine the lowest ventricular filling pressures that could be achieved with vasodilator and diuretic therapy while maintaining cardiac output. In 20 of 25 patients normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (PCWs) were achieved (mean 10 mm Hg compared with 30 mm Hg at baseline). Stroke volume was 60 vs 39 ml at baseline. Stroke work index was 30 vs 19 g-m/m2. For each patient, over the range of PCWs, stroke volume and stroke work index were maintained and were often maximal at the lowest PCW achieved. The upright position was well tolerated in patients with normal supine PCW. Normal filling pressures can be achieved in patients with congestive heart failure without compromise of cardiac output. While congestive symptoms should be improved, the feasibility and benefit of maintaining normal filling pressures over a long term must be established.

"input: Abstract: Percutaneous coronary laser thermal angioplasty was successfully performed before conventional balloon angioplasty in a 55 year old white man with a 90% left anterior descending artery stenotic lesion and angina at rest (Canadian Heart Association class IV). The lesion was reduced to 50% residual stenosis using a 1.7 mm laser-heated metallic capped fiber and two pulses of 8 W of argon laser energy, each delivered for 5 seconds. With subsequent balloon angioplasty, the lesion was further decreased to 10% residual stenosis. The entire procedure was well tolerated without chest pain or burning, vessel perforation or spasm, thrombus formation or embolization of debris. The patient was free of pain at 1 month follow-up. This case demonstrates the feasibility of safely performing percutaneous coronary laser thermal angioplasty. Additional studies are indicated to determine the clinical role and potential benefits of coronary laser thermal angioplasty in relation to the established procedures of bypass surgery and conventional balloon angioplasty.

The current guidelines propose an optimal preventive diet for coronary heart disease. Emphasis is placed on the reduction of both saturated fat and total fat. Complex carbohydrates are recommended as the major replacement for calories from fat. Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats partially replace calories from other fat sources. Cholesterol and sodium guidelines are expressed relative to caloric intake, with an upper limit on each. The use of alcohol as a possible means of preventing cardiovascular disease is not advised. Maintenance of ideal body weight by calorie control and an adequate level of activity is emphasized.

"input: Abstract: Systematic multidimensional assessment techniques such as the Functional Assessment Inventory (FAI) are increasingly used with the elderly for outcome measurement, prediction of service needs, and accurate description for comparative purposes. The FAI is a structured interview followed by a rating process which compares patient status against standard descriptive phrases. Patients are assessed in five areas: mental health, physical health, social resources, economic resources, and activities of daily living (ADL). The validity of the FAI was tested by comparing ratings of patient health obtained by a single investigator using only the instrument with ratings obtained by consensus from an interdisciplinary home care team providing long-term care for the patients studied. An excellent level of agreement (weighted kappas from .583 to .780) was found in all areas studied. A single significant difference in ADL rating with a high correlation coefficient (r = .85) was interpreted as due to a difference between the single rater and the team in the definition of ADL. The ease of obtaining summary ratings from clinical personnel suggests that further exploration of this rapid quantification of patient health is warranted.

There was a significant (p less than 0.05) improvement in the mean score for early-morning stiffness, grip strength and the severity of nodules and vasculitis at 6 weeks and 3 months when compared to the initial visit. However, in most patients, this benefit was not sustained despite continued cytotoxic and steroid therapy. A rise in the haemoglobin and fall in ESR was maintained throughout the study period.

"input: Abstract: Fast arm movements involving the shoulder and elbow joints have been analysed in normal controls and in patients with Parkinson's disease. The subjects were requested to draw on a graphic tablet triangles and squares of different size and shape. The patients produced a larger number of EMG burst compared with controls. The movements were accurate, and each segment of the geometric figures was performed with a roughly straight trajectory, but the time necessary to trace the geometric figures and the pauses at the vertices were prolonged. We conclude that in Parkinson's disease the disability in generating two joint ballistic movements depends on a difficulty in running motor programmes for complex trajectories.

"input: Abstract: The serum testosterone level (STL) was determined in 84 male and 32 female patients with gastric carcinoma and in 58 male and 20 female patients with benign diseases as a control group. The STL of the male patients with carcinoma was lower (446 +/- 149 ng/dl) than that of the male control group (532 +/- 132 ng/dl) (P less than 0.001). Even 17 male patients of the early carcinoma showed lower STL (440 +/- 117 ng/dl) than the normal group (P less than 0.001). In the female patients, it was also lower (31.6 +/- 16.0 ng/dl) than in the control group (46.3 +/- 15.3 ng/dl) (P less than 0.005). The postoperative STL of the cases surviving the gastrectomy was higher than the preoperative data in 32 male patients (P less than 0.005) as well as in 12 female patients (0.025 greater than P greater than 0.01), whereas it obviously decreased in the patients who died of recurrence. Therefore, it appears that gastric carcinoma decreases the STL by some mechanism.

"input: Abstract: We report a case of a small infant apparently dying of the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) with a postmortem blood dicyclomine level of 200 ng/mL. Review of the literature and the comparison with blood dicyclomine values from four rabbits given equivalent doses suggests that a blood dicyclomine value of 200 ng/mL probably is in the therapeutic range for infants. Although safely used for years for infantile colic, recently, the administration of dicyclomine has been related to acute episodes of apnea, seizures, and coma. In the absence of those acute reactions, we feel that a 200-ng/mL blood dicyclomine level in a child dying of apparent SIDS should not prevent categorization of the death as SIDS.

"input: Abstract: Between January 1979 and June 1985, 10 patients with acute allergic interstitial nephritis were seen in a clinical nephrology service at a large regional hospital. The onset of renal failure was temporally related to the use of a drug: a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) (in four patients), cimetidine (in three), antibiotics (in two) or allopurinol (in one). The onset of renal failure was acute in three patients and insidious in seven. Two patients also exhibited marked proteinuria. Clinical features such as fever, rash, hematuria, pyuria with or without eosinophiluria, and mild to marked proteinuria had led to suspicion of the disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by renal biopsy findings of inflammatory cells, predominantly lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils. Three patients required hemodialysis; two of them received steroids as well. Steroid therapy was also used in two patients with NSAID-induced proteinuria. Renal function improved in nine patients by 35 days, but one patient continued to have slow but progressive deterioration of renal function. Acute interstitial nephritis can be distinguished from other forms of acute renal failure by heavy renal uptake of gallium 67, maximal 48 hours or more after injection. The improvement in renal function after discontinuation of the implicated drug, the characteristic histopathological findings of allergic interstitial nephritis, and the presence of eosinophils and sometimes IgE in the blood suggest a hypersensitivity reaction.

"input: Abstract: RV and LV failure frequently coexist. Experimental evidence suggests that RV failure results from a primary insult to the right ventricle and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. LV failure results in an elevation of the left atrial pressure and thereby a reduction in the transpulmonary hydrostatic gradient. Because RV function depends on the contraction of the left ventricle, this contribution is reduced during LV failure. Treatment should be aimed first at restoring LV function. If RV failure persists and is not due to a simple mechanical problem, treatment of RV failure should be commenced. If volume loading, inotropes, and pH adjustments do not result in adequate RV output, a mechanical assist device should be considered. RHBP is the most powerful device, and it is capable of restoring systemic perfusion even when there is no residual RV function. Clinical results with this device have been most encouraging--most patients demonstrate improved RV function and a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance after several days of treatment, allowing them to be weaned from assist. However, this technique is very invasive and requires constant close attention. PABC is a simple but less powerful assist device. Experimental studies suggest that if RV function is not extremely depressed--cardiac output is greater than 50 percent of normal--PABC may be effective in restoring systemic perfusion to normal levels. Current results suggest that RHBP remains the gold standard for severe RV failure, but further clinical experience with PABC may more clearly define its role in the management of RV failure.

"input: Abstract: The effectiveness of intralesional bleomycin (1 U/ml) in the treatment of warts refractory to conventional methods of treatment has been shown in well-controlled studies. We have now evaluated more dilute concentrations of bleomycin in the treatment of recalcitrant warts. Warts were assigned for therapy with intralesional bleomycin at a concentration of 0.25 U/ml, 0.5 U/ml, or 1 U/ml at 3-week intervals. If warts persisted after three injections or had recurred by 3 months' follow-up, treatment was considered a failure. Twenty-six patients whose warts had persisted after conventional treatment entered the study. Three patients had spontaneous regression of untreated warts during therapy and were not included in the results. Of seventy-nine warts treated with intralesional bleomycin, sixty-two (78%) were cured after one to three injections. Responding warts showed a hemorrhagic eschar even with the lower bleomycin concentrations and healed without complication. Almost all treated warts responded, although not all were cured. Treatment with bleomycin at 0.5 U/ml was as effective as treatment with 1 U/ml. Bleomycin at 0.25 U/ml is effective therapy but not enough warts were treated to permit a conclusion when compared with higher concentrations.

"input: Abstract: The characteristics of train-of-four recovery after atracurium or vecuronium were studied, under enflurane anaesthesia, and compared with those associated with tubocurarine-induced blockade. Ten patients each received vecuronium 0.1 mg kg-1, atracurium 0.5 mg kg-1 or tubocurarine 0.5 mg kg-1. Neuromuscular blockade was calculated as the percent depression of the first twitch, and was determined at the time of reappearance of the second, third and fourth twitches of the train-of-four. The pattern during recovery from blockade induced by the three neuromuscular blocking agents was similar, with T2, T3 and T4 reappearing at approximately 93%, 89% and 86% residual blockade, respectively. These results are different from those previously reported by Lee (1975) indicating that, under enflurane anaesthesia, the train-of-four count may give an incorrect estimate of the degree of neuromuscular blockade.

"input: Abstract: Intravenous administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMS) on three occasions resulted in fever, rash, and wheezing in a 30-year-old man with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with Pneumocytis carinii pneumonia. Pentamidine administration produced fever, severe myositis, and clinical deterioration, and therefore, desensitization to TMS was attempted. This was done with low doses of oral suspension and then intravenous administration during a period of 60 hours. The patient reacted with fevers, arthralgia, and erythema that cleared 4 days after the desensitization was completed. This single case of successful desensitization to TMS in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome suggests that the oral route may be useful in similar situations when this drug is urgently needed.

"input: Abstract: Retrospective analysis of 82 pregnancies in women with either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease suggested that, in general, neither disease had a major effect on pregnancy outcome. The birth-weights of babies born to women with inflammatory bowel disease were marginally lower than those born to women in a control group matched for age and parity, but the difference was statistically significant only in women with Crohn's disease. In both disease groups there was a higher frequency of low haemoglobin levels in pregnancy than in the matched control groups. There were no statistically significant effects of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease on duration of pregnancy, mode of delivery or raised blood pressure and/or proteinuria. In the absence of a relapse, a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease should not influence obstetric management.

"input: Abstract: In a stratified random sample of 320 white adults, the prevalence of puncture skin test positivity (ST +) to Lolium perenne (rye grass)-pollen extract (LPE) was 16%. Fifteen percent of all subjects (or 84% of subjects classified LPE IgE antibody positive [Ab +]) was classified IgE Ab + to highly purified Lol p I (Rye I), and 4% of all subjects (or 26% of subjects classified LPE IgE Ab +) was classified IgE Ab + to highly purified Lol p II (Rye II). These data and similar results obtained in an allergy-enriched group of 361 subjects are consistent with previous studies that Lol I is a major allergen and Lol II is a minor allergen of LPE. Whether we studied LPE, Lol I, or Lol II, responder subjects were younger than nonresponder subjects and more male than female subjects were responders. We then investigated the quantitative interrelationships among ST, IgE, and IgG Ab responsiveness to LPE, Lol I, and Lol II in the allergy-enriched group. For each allergen, log-log correlations were strong and significant for ST versus IgE Ab and for IgE Ab versus IgG Ab. All subjects IgE Ab + to Lol I or Lol II were IgG Ab + to that allergen, supporting other evidence for a commonality in the genetic control influencing the production of IgE and IgG Abs to a given allergen. Log-log correlations among ST end points, IgE Ab levels, or IgG Ab levels were strong for LPE versus either Lol I or Lol II but weak between Lol I and Lol II, consistent with the reported lack of cross-reactivity between Lol I and Lol II. Despite these findings, almost all Lol II + subjects were Lol I + by ST (98%), IgE Ab (91%), and IgG Ab (83%), suggesting that the Ia-restricted immune recognition of both these molecules is at least in part under a common genetic control.

"input: Abstract: In order to perform quantitative in vitro and clinical studies on the removal of Al by the combined therapy of DFO administration and HD, an HPLC system for measuring DFO was established and a leaky membrane with enhanced permeability to middle molecular substances was developed. The DFO infusion caused rises in plasma Al levels (regarded as indicating the elution of accumulated Al) in patients undergoing HD. Plasma levels increased most in long-term patients and those with bone pain. Examination of Al clearances demonstrated that this increased plasma Al content passed through HD membranes at levels of more than 80 micrograms/l, and that the leaky membrane was more effective for removal of Al as well as DFO than the conventional one. Although a 1:1 complex between DFO and Al in an aqueous solution was confirmed, the formation of Al-rich complexes in vivo was suggested. It is concluded that Al-DFO complex formed in vivo can be effectively removed across the leaky membrane.

"input: Abstract: A 58-year-old subject with a history of occupational asthma to red-cedar sawdust underwent specific inhalation challenges with this product. Significant increases in airway responsiveness to histamine (tenfold fall in PC20 FEV1) were documented 7 hours after exposure for 5 minutes to red cedar while baseline spirometry remained unchanged. A dual asthmatic reaction was induced during the following days by exposing the subject to red-cedar sawdust for 30 minutes and plicatic acid for 7 minutes. After recovery of PC20, the subject was reexposed to plicatic acid for 15 and 30 seconds on 2 consecutive days. No significant changes in FEV1, forced vital capacity, and residual volume were demonstrated in the following 8 hours, although minimal changes in forced expiratory flow rate between 25% and 75% of FVC were observed. PC20 dropped significantly and required 2 weeks to recover. This example illustrates that bronchial hyperresponsiveness to histamine can precede the changes in airway caliber after an antigen challenge. It also demonstrates that such changes can persist for up to 2 weeks after the challenge, even when no significant changes in FEV1 are induced.

"input: Abstract: Clinical and morphologic features of 89 cases of childhood yolk sac tumor (YS) and embryonal carcinoma (EC) (29 associated with teratomas) submitted to the Rare Tumor Registry of the Southwest Oncology Group (1971-1979) or the Pediatric Oncology Group (1980-1984) between 1971 and 1984 were reviewed and submitted to statistical analysis. This review showed an improved survival for each 5-year period regardless of tumor site, no statistically significant difference between ""pure"" tumors and those mixed with other teratomatous components, no statistically significant difference between YS and EC in children, a better than reported prognosis for sacrococcygeal tumors occurring after the neonatal period, a particularly poor prognosis for neonatal ""benign"" sacrococcygeal teratomas resected without coccygectomy when they recur as YS, excellent survival for all testicular tumors regardless of age or the presence of EC, and the occurrence of mediastinal tumors in females.

"input: Abstract: Although it is not clear why coronary occlusion and restenosis occur after successful coronary angioplasty, factors related to the procedure may influence early and late results. The possible adverse effects of a medial tear documented histologically and produced during balloon angioplasty of the common carotid arteries were studied in 30 fully heparinized (100 U/kg body weight) normal pigs. Scanning electron microscopy showed endothelial denudation and extensive platelet deposition in all dilated arterial segments. Visible macroscopic mural thrombus was present within an hour of the procedure in 29 (91%) of the 32 arteries that had a medial tear documented by histologic study; the tear produced an indium-111-labeled platelet deposition of 116.4 +/- 26.5 X 10(6)/cm2 (mean +/- SE) and total thrombotic occlusion in 2 arteries (4%). None of the 24 arteries without a medial tear had a thrombus, and the mean platelet deposition in that group was 7.0 +/- 0.5 X 10(6)/cm2 (p less than 0.0008). In 12 pigs scanned with a gamma camera, visible thrombus was associated with platelet deposition in excess of 20 X 10(6)/cm2 in 12 arteries, 9 of which had a positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram. Thus, arterial angioplasty causes deep arterial injury, which appears to be a major cause of mural thrombosis, heavy platelet deposition, a positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram and acute arterial occlusion. A positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram was always associated with macroscopic thrombus of at least 20 > 10(6) platelets/cm2 and underlying deep arterial injury.

"input: Abstract: DNA measurements yield information about the nature of cells and may provide diagnostic and prognostic information. Static cytofluorometry was performed on smears removed at microlaryngoscopy from 107 vocal cord lesions (96 patients). All stem cell lines were diploid except 3; 2 carcinomas and 1 severe dysplasia were polyploid. The mean proliferative activity (percentage of nuclei greater than diploid peak) was 2.1% for the group of epithelia with hyperplasia and mild dysplasia, 3.1% for those with moderate dysplasia, 4.0% for severe dysplasia, and 6.8% for carcinomas. Hypertetraploid cell nuclei (HT cells) were not found in epithelia with hyperplasia and mild dysplasia. Seven out of 15 patients with epithelia showing moderate dysplasia had HT cells; 5 of these patients developed a carcinoma. One of 8 without HT cells developed a severe dysplasia. Nine patients with severe dysplasia had HT cells; 4 had recurrences and 4 developed carcinoma within 4 years. In 14 patients without HT cells, 3 had recurrences and 1 developed a carcinoma 6 years later. HT cells were found in 15 patients with T1 & T2 carcinomas; residual carcinoma was present in 2 after radiotherapy and 4 had recurrences within 11 months. Fourteen patients with T1 & T2 carcinoma did not have any HT cells; one had residual carcinoma after radiotherapy and 3 had recurrences between 18 months and 4 years. DNA measurements and, especially, the demonstration of epithelia with HT cells prove to be of prognostic importance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

"input: Abstract: Microsporum nanum is a dermatophyte that can cause disease in both man and animals and is most frequently associated with ringworm infection in pigs. Human infections are rare in the literature. Three new cases of human M. nanum infection are reported here. Two patients had inflammatory tinea faciei and one had tinea cruris. The patients were successfully treated with clotrimazole or miconazole cream, sometimes combined with griseofulvin. All three patients were hog farmers and lived in the same small rural area. Occupational exposure is suggested as the cause of infection.

"input: Abstract: In 14 intubated, spontaneously breathing children with body weight (bw) ranging from 8.3 to 25.6 kg, the influence of midazolam 0.1 mg kg-1 i.m. (group M0.1, n = 7) and 0.2 mg kg-1 i.m. (group M0.2, n = 7) as premedication, on sedation, ventilation, ventilatory response to carbon dioxide and hormonal stress response was studied in connection with minor surgical procedures during halothane anaesthesia. The concentrations of catecholamines, ACTH and cortisol were measured immediately after induction, during undisturbed anaesthesia, during surgery and 15 min after the end of the surgical procedure. Sedation was better and plasma catecholamine concentrations during undisturbed anaesthesia were less in children receiving the larger dose of midazolam. During surgery and in recovery there were no differences in hormone concentrations. In recovery, the concentrations of all hormones were significantly greater compared with during undisturbed anaesthesia. During surgery, VE and respiratory rate were somewhat lower in group M0.2 while E' CO2 was similar. A dose dependent depression of the response to carbon dioxide was found. However, clinically, the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide after surgery was considered to be adequate in both groups.

"input: Abstract: The fingernails of twenty-four patients with classical adult (type 1) pityriasis rubra pilaris were examined for changes in nail morphology and a comparison was made with the fingernail morphology of twenty-seven consecutive psoriatic patients with nail changes. Distal yellow-brown discoloration, subungual hyperkeratosis, nail plate thickening, and splinter hemorrhages indicate a diagnosis of type 1 pityriasis rubra pilaris rather than psoriasis, while onycholysis (particularly marginal), salmon patches, small pits, and larger indentations of the nail plate indicate a diagnosis of psoriasis. Histology demonstrated that a nail biopsy would be a useful diagnostic procedure if nails were involved in isolation but provided no additional diagnostic features to those found from biopsy specimens of involved skin in the two conditions. The similarity in nail morphology between the type 1 pityriasis rubra pilaris patients and five patients with chronic erythroderma resulting from Sezary syndrome indicated that these changes may represent a nonspecific reaction pattern that may result from prolonged erythema of the proximal nail bed and matrix. The rough nails (trachyonychia) described in advanced Sezary syndrome were not observed in any of our patients.

"input: Abstract: Progression of coronary artery stenosis was measured using a quantitative, computer-assisted cinevideodensitometric method in 144 arterial segments in 44 subjects undergoing coronary arteriography on two separate occasions at least 6 months apart. Projected coronary arteriograms were digitized into 512 X 512 pixel mode and percent stenosis was calculated by comparing background-corrected videodensitometric values over stenotic and normal segments. Subjects underwent repeat coronary arteriography because of worsening symptoms of angina or heart failure; subjects with renal failure, coronary artery bypass grafts or cardiac transplant were excluded. Clinical variables determined at the time of the first arteriogram included age, sex, serum cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and presence or absence of cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus and left ventricular hypertrophy. The mean interval between arteriograms was 29.3 months. Overall progression of coronary stenosis was observed in 40 of the 44 subjects; the mean progression at 24 months was 39% (90% confidence interval, 33 to 45%) and at 36 months was 48% (40 to 56%). The degree of overall progression was related to the length of time between arteriograms (F = 5.81, p less than 0.05) and to serum cholesterol level (F = 4.37, p less than 0.05). These data indicate that using an accurate, quantitative method, it is possible to measure progression of coronary artery atherosclerosis within 2 to 3 years of the initial arteriogram. Serum cholesterol appears to be an important determinant of disease progression.

"input: Abstract: Percutaneous absorption of hydrocortisone was studied in 18 children (aged from 6 weeks to 14 1/2 years) with atopic or seborrhoeic dermatitis, by measuring their serum cortisol before and after application of 1% hydrocortisone cream. Endogenous secretion of cortisol was suppressed with dexamethasone. A 24 h absorption test was performed on nine children. In six, percutaneous absorption was detected. The highest serum cortisol level was reached within the first 6 h. A 4 h absorption test was developed on the basis of the 24 h test. This short absorption test was performed on nine children, and in eight of them absorption of hydrocortisone was detected. The rise of serum cortisol ranged from 98 to 2669 nmol/l. The 2 h ACTH test was performed to evaluate the effect of previous treatment with topical glucocorticoids. Suppressed adrenocortical function was found in five of 13 children, and was associated significantly with high post-application serum cortisol levels. This occurred more often in infants with a severe skin disorder than in older children or in those with mild or moderate skin disease.

"input: Abstract: Separate antisera were raised against keratocyst, dentigerous cyst, and radicular cyst fluids and used to analyse a range of fluids from cysts of known type. Samples were subjected to crossed immunoelectrophoresis into homologous antiserum through an intermediate gel containing antibody to whole human serum to screen out serum derived components. A major antigen, designated X, which seems to be of epithelial origin but is not a keratin, was identified in keratocyst fluids. X resolves as two bands on sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with molecular weights of 81 K and 89 K and its major antigenic epitope is associated with disulphide bonds. Of the cysts studied to date, antigen X has been found consistently and exclusively in fluids from keratocysts; its presence and detection is independent of total soluble protein concentration and thus offers real potential as a reliable marker for preoperative diagnosis.

"input: Abstract: This article describes the immunologic and pulmonary abnormalities and the chemical composition of pleural effusion fluid in a patient with intestinal lymphangiectasia as they are effected by therapeutic measures during a 7-year period. Lymphedema was first noticed in the patient at 3 years of age, and pleural effusions developed 7 years later. Thoracentesis demonstrated that the right pleural fluid was yellow, clear, and had the composition of lymph. The left pleural fluid was milky and had a higher triglyceride and lymphocyte content than the right pleural fluid. Complete removal of pleural fluid transiently increased total lung capacity to a maximum of 52% predicted. Strict dietary management with a low-fat and high-protein diet resulted in a transient partial reversal of circulating lymphopenia and low T cell concentration. This was accompanied by a decrease in lymphocyte and T cell concentration in the pleural fluid. Unstimulated mononuclear cells from pleural fluid synthesized increased amounts of DNA, and added mitogens or antigens further increased DNA synthesis. Dietary therapy had a minimal effect on this DNA synthesis. Despite circulating hypogammaglobulinemia, normal antibody activity was detected. The proportion of B cells in pleural fluid was greater than that in the circulation, and dietary therapy did not alter this difference. Pulmonary physiology improved during the initial 9-month period of diet therapy, but then the rate of fluid accumulation increased, causing respiratory compromise. Stability was achieved by a right-sided pleurodesis, followed 18 months later by a left pleurodesis with the addition of a shunt to provide internal lymph drainage.

"input: Abstract: Between July 1973 and December 1979, 1171 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy. Of those patients, 195 had osseous metastases only. Upon initial diagnosis, 48% had osteolytic metastases; 13% had osteoblastic metastases; 38% had mixed metastases; and 1% had diffuse osteoporosis without any obvious bone destruction. The most common sites of involvement were the dorsal spine (62%), lumbosacral spine (72%), and pelvis (79%). Objective response to chemotherapy was observed in 59% of patients; complete responses were noted in 7%, and partial responses in 52%. The median survival was 28 months (range, 1-118 months). The median time lapse between the start of chemotherapy and disease progression was 14 months (range, 1-109 months). In 32 patients who responded to the treatment, chemotherapy was discontinued after 2 years, and their median duration of continued remission at 39 and 75 months after the completion of therapy. The incidence of pathological fractures was 57%; the most common sites were the spine, which sustained compression fractures, and the ribs. The incidences of hypercalcemia and spinal cord compression due to metastases were 19% and 10%, respectively.

"input: Abstract: Using a series of graded destabilizing forces, we have developed a simple quantitative test of the postural response: the Postural Stress Test (PST). Suitable for widespread testing of elderly subjects, the test evaluates the subject's ability to avoid a fall as well as the appropriateness of the response. We have determined that by comparison with young subjects, the elderly controls have compromised although functionally effective balance. On the other hand, the balance response was severely compromised in half of the individuals with a history of falls. Experience with the Postural Stress Test suggests it will predict those elderly individuals with a tendency to fall as well as provide a simple mechanism for studying the balance response in the elderly.

"input: Abstract: To assess the influence of time on the inducibility by programmed electrical stimulation of ventricular arrhythmias after acute myocardial infarction, 18 patients were studied on day 5 and day 24 after infarction with a stimulation protocol employing a maximum of three right ventricular extrastimuli during sinus rhythm and at three paced cycle lengths. All patients were without documented sustained ventricular arrhythmia (sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) before the investigation. Sustained ventricular arrhythmia was induced in two patients on day 5, but in nine on day 24 after infarction. This difference in incidence was statistically significant (p less than 0.05), as was the change in the distribution ratio of induced sustained ventricular arrhythmia from day 5 to day 24 (p less than 0.05). The types of arrhythmia induced on day 24 were sustained ventricular tachycardia with a mean cycle length of 207 ms in six cases (five monomorphic, one polymorphic), and ventricular fibrillation in three cases. These nine patients did not differ from the remaining nine patients in maximal serum creatine kinase, infarct site, number of stenosed coronary arteries, global left ventricular ejection fraction (47 +/- 7% versus 46 +/- 10%) and results of 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring, but they had a significantly shorter right ventricular effective refractory period (223 +/- 10 ms versus 259 +/- 28 ms; p less than 0.05). During the follow-up period of 24 +/-5 months no patient died, had syncopal attacks or developed spontaneous episodes of sustained ventricular arrhythmia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

"input: Abstract: Boerhaave's syndrome represents a diagnostic dilemma for the emergency physician. The prognosis of this truly life-threatening emergency is darkened by any significant diagnostic delay. Unfortunately, classic or expected symptoms and signs are frequently absent at presentation, a circumstance that leads to frequent misdiagnosis. Two cases of Boerhaave's syndrome with ""atypical"" clinical presentations are reviewed and discussed. It is clear that Boerhaave's syndrome should always be suspected in the evaluation of any sudden chest, abdominal, or back pain associated with emesis. However, emphasis should be placed on the fact that this entity may occur without emesis. The chest radiograph is the most helpful diagnostic aid. Undoubtedly, maintenance of a high degree of suspicion by the emergency physician for Boerhaave's syndrome will lead consistently to earlier diagnosis, and subsequent aggressive intervention should result in considerable reduction in rates of both morbidity and mortality.

"input: Abstract: The NK-1.1(-) mouse was constructed by weekly injections of monoclonal anti-NK-1.1 antibody from birth through adulthood. Spleen cells from these mice have decreased NK-1.1+ cells and null (Thy-1- and B220-) cells. Their splenic NK activity to YAC targets was low and was not enhanced by IFN-alpha or IFN-beta. Bone marrow (BM) of these NK-1.1(-) mice have normal precursors to NK cells: 1) NK activity could be generated from NK-1.1(-) BM cells cultured in rIL 2 for 5 to 6 days. These cultured BM cells expressed Qa-5, Thy-1, AsGm-1, and NK-1.1 antigens. The precursor cells of these BM cytotoxic cells are NK-1.1-; 2) transfer of BM cells from the NK-1.1(-) mice reconstituted the NK activity of irradiated, NK-depleted recipients. Lymphokine-activated killer cells could also be generated from spleens of these NK-1.1(-) mice. Therefore, the NK-1.1(-) mice were specifically depleted of mature cytotoxic NK cells, but not the NK-1.1- precursors of NK cells. This mouse model is valuable to study ontogeny and physiologic relevance of NK cells.

"input: Abstract: A total of 422 patients with malignant lymphoma of bone who were seen at the Mayo Clinic from 1907 through 1982 were placed into four major groups based on stage of disease. There was one group with primary lymphoma of bone, one group with multifocal osseous lymphoma, and two groups with lymphoma of bone and nodal or soft tissue (or both) disease. The last-mentioned two groups were separated on the basis of time of onset of osseous lymphoma in relation to the nonosseous disease. The stage of disease was the single most important prognostic indicator of overall survival in malignant lymphoma of bone. The 5- and 10-year survival rates were, respectively, 58% and 53% for patients with primary bone lymphoma, 22% and 12.5% for patients with bone and nodal or soft tissue (or both) disease, and 42% and 35% for patients with multifocal osseous disease. Features having no significant prognostic value were sex of the patient, histologic grade of the lymphoma (according to the Working Formulation and the Kiel system), and presence of T-cell features or cleaved cells (or both). This study is not able to adequately address efficacy of treatment. In fact, treatment may be very important in outcome.

"input: Abstract: The mechanism of the increased renal clearance of amylase and the amylase to creatinine clearance ratio (CAM/CCR) in acute pancreatitis remains controversial with both renal tubular dysfunction and altered glomerular permeability being invoked as explanations. To differentiate between these mechanisms, we investigated the quantity and character of protein excretion in 10 patients with pancreatitis. For a short period of time, seven of 10 patients had mild proteinuria with a mean protein excretion rate of 230 +/- 154 mg/24 hr. Proteinuria decreased in 9/9 survivors to 17 +/- 18 mg/24 hr. Albumin excretion rate initially was minimally increased in 10/10 patients with a mean of 61 +/- 40 mg/24 hr, decreasing during recovery in 8/9 survivors to 10.9 +/- 10.4 mg/24 hr (P less than 0.01). Electrophoresis of urine obtained during the acute phase consistently showed a low molecular weight proteinuria pattern that cleared with recovery. Twenty-one of 22 urinary samples with an elevated CAM/CCR had a low molecular weight protein pattern. All the above findings can be explained by alterations in renal tubular reabsorption of proteins without changes in glomerular permeability. In 2/4 patients a low molecular weight protein was present in urine specimens from the acute phase that was not present in highly concentrated urine specimens from the recovery period. This raises the possibility that an abnormal low molecular weight protein enters the serum in acute pancreatitis, which, after glomerular filtration, produces the renal tubular malfunction found in acute pancreatitis.

"input: Abstract: The cutaneous application of antiviral agents was studied by iontophoresis, a process that increases penetration of most drugs 20- to 60-fold. Twenty-seven subjects with vesicular orolabial herpes were treated one time in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study: nine received vidarabine monophosphate (ara-AMP), nine received acyclovir (ACV), and nine received NaCl. Ara-AMP-treated lesions yielded lower titers of virus after 24 hr compared with lesions treated with NaCl or ACV (P less than .05). Ara-AMP significantly decreased the duration of shedding of virus (P less than .05) and time to dry crust (P less than .05) compared with the other two agents. There was a trend toward decreased healing time after ara-AMP treatment.

"input: Abstract: Coronary dissection and total coronary occlusion leading to emergency coronary surgery are the most frequent complications of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and their occurrence usually is unpredictable. To identify angiographic characteristics of coronary stenoses that may affect the incidence of these complications, the diagnostic pre-PTCA coronary angiograms of 38 consecutive patients (group I) undergoing emergency coronary surgery for dissection or occlusion were reviewed and compared with the angiograms of a random sample of 38 patients (stratified for left anterior descending and right coronary arteries) from a group of 1151 who did not need emergency coronary surgery (group II). Stenosis morphology before angioplasty was considered ""complicated"" if at least one of the following criteria was present: irregular borders, intraluminal lucency, and localization of stenosis in curve or at bifurcation. Baseline characteristics, maximum inflation pressures, types of balloon catheters used, and routinely registered angiographic stenosis properties (severity, length, eccentricity, and calcification) were similar in both groups. Irregular borders before PTCA were present in 22 of 38 patients in group I vs 10 of 38 in group II (p less than .05), intraluminal lucency in 22 of 38 vs nine of 38 (p less than .05), localization in curve in 27 of 38 pts vs 16 of 38 (p less than .05), and localization at bifurcation in 11 of 38 vs 15 of 38 (NS). Complicated angiographic morphology of coronary stenosis may represent a risk factor for dissection or occlusion. Therefore, although the predictive value of these findings is low, detailed evaluation of angiographic morphology of coronary stenoses may improve patient selection and reduce complication rates of PTCA.

"input: Abstract: The Inyo nail is a new intramedullary device for the treatment of fractures of the distal fibula. It is a tapered V-shaped nail made of malleable stainless steel, which provides rigid fracture fixation. Torsional stress is resisted because of its triflanged shape. It may be introduced closed, using the image intensifier. Two groups of patients were evaluated: Group I was treated with the Inyo nail and Group II was treated by the Association For the Study of Internal Fixation (ASIF) technique. Eighty-five percent of the patients in Group I were rated as good, compared with 63% in Group II. There was significantly less morbidity and complications in Group I. Several factors must be observed in the treatment of ankle fractures. Stress radiographs must be obtained intraoperative. Surgery may be indicated in unstable supination lateral rotation Type II injuries, if these occur in patients with high physical demands. Anatomic reduction of the lateral malleolus must be obtained. Early weight-bearing and motion produces the best result. Late reconstruction of malunions can be accomplished using the Inyo nail.

"input: Abstract: Two systems for measuring embryo development in vitro were evaluated. One was a 1-4 scale based on a subjective evaluation of embryo quality (EQ) from microscopic appearance. In addition, a formula for scoring embryo growth rate in vitro was developed. The embryo development rating (EDR) was based on the ratio between the time at which embryos were observed at a particular stage after insemination and the time at which they would be expected to reach that stage in a hypothetical ""ideal"" growth rate with a cell cycle length of 11.9 hr. Using this scoring system, ""normally"" growing embryos scored 100. This approach was aimed at partially normalizing the data and allowed all embryos to be analyzed similarly regardless of the time of observation. Analysis of 1539 embryo replacements resulting in 232 clinical pregnancies showed that both EDR and embryo-quality scores were of value in predicting success, with clinical pregnancy most likely to eventuate from a combination of moderate to good EQ scores (2-4) coupled with average or above-average growth rates (EDR scores from 90 to 129). Poor-quality and very slowly or very rapidly growing embryos were underrepresented in cycles that proceeded to pregnancy. These inferences were based on all embryos transferred (mean, 2.73 per transfer cycle), and they were substantiated by an analysis of 33 pregnancies resulting from replacement of a single embryo and from 18 pregnancies in which all embryos scored the same with both systems. EQ and EDR were significantly associated with each other and together provide a valuable guide in predicting pregnancy, in selecting embryos for freezing, and in monitoring day-to-day performance in the in vitro fertilization (IVF) program.

"input: Abstract: Spastic patients were instructed to make accurate, rapid ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion movements over different distances to a target. Ankle position and surface electromyograms (EMGs) from tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles were recorded. In 3 of 8 spastic patients tested, dorsiflexion evoked velocity-dependent activation of the antagonist (SOL) muscle which impeded the movement to the extent that the limb unintentionally reversed movement direction. We propose that this activation is reflex in origin since it is tightly synchronized, has a large peak amplitude, occurs about 50 ms after the initiation of the movement, and is velocity dependent. One of the 3 patients who had reflex-induced antagonist activation in dorsiflexion also demonstrated sustained clonus during plantarflexion. This usually occurred only if the target had been overshot so that the return of the limb stretched the soleus muscle and triggered clonus. We conclude that in some patients, hyperactive stretch reflexes cause movement deficits.

"input: Abstract: Colloidal gold solutions conjugated with staphylococcal protein A (SpA) are widely used in high-resolution immunocytochemical studies to visualize antibodies bound at antigenic sites. Here we report that colloidal gold solutions conjugated with SpA, bovine serum albumin (BSA), or gelatin bind selectively to structures in glutaraldehyde-fixed, plastic-embedded epidermis of rabbit, mouse, and human. Two types of keratohyaline granules are present in epidermis, a phosphorus-rich (PR) and a sulphur-rich (SR) type. The PR keratohyaline granules were strongly labeled with gold particles, whereas SR keratohyaline granules or other structures in the living cells of epidermis were unlabeled. The PR keratohyaline granules are assumed to be precursors of the matrix protein of cornified cells, and intense gold labeling occurred over the lower layer of cornified cells (i.e., stratum lucidum). More superficial cornified cells were weakly labeled or unlabeled. The gold labeling pattern was identical whether SpA, BSA, or gelatin was used to stabilize the colloidal gold solution. The mechanism of binding of protein-conjugated gold to PR keratohyaline granules and matrix protein of cornified cells is not clear. It is speculated that the charged gold particles are not completely coated by the stabilizing protein, allowing for an electrostatic interaction with charged proteins in sections of cells.

"input: Abstract: To assess the best method of quantitating progression of coronary disease, we studied four measurements in 114 coronary segments from 35 medically treated patients from whom angiograms were obtained 5 years apart. Only stenoses of less than 70% that were visualized in nearly identical projections on both angiograms were evaluated. Vessel edges were measured by use of catheter calibration and an automated computer algorithm yielding two ""absolute dimensions"" (mean and minimum diameters) and two measurements (percent stenosis and atheroma area) that required a ""normal reference"" diameter. The coefficient of variation for repeated segment measurements was less for mean and minimum diameter than for percent stenosis and area of atheroma. The best measure of progression of coronary disease as determined by t test comparison of different methods was the change in mean diameter over time (6.7 +/- 14.1% decrease), whether calculated on a per coronary segment or per patient basis (p less than .001). Based on this measurement and its standard deviation of progression of coronary disease in this patient subset with relatively benign disease, it is estimated that 470 patients per group would be required for an interventional study to demonstrate a 33% reduction in disease progression (207 patients for 50% reduction) at a 95% confidence level and 90% power.

"input: Abstract: Twenty-two patients with recurrent nose bleeds and varicose vessels on the nasal septum were subjected to transection of the vessels and followed-up for 2 years. One month after the operation, it was not possible to identify the original vessels. In other locations new varicose vessels began to appear after 1 month, and at the end of the follow-up period were observed on 9 out of 10 operated sides. The transection resulted in an immediate decrease in the frequency of nose bleeds and at the end of the control period 12 (55%) of the patients had had less than 4 bleeds during the previous year in spite of the observed rapid formation of new vessels. Mucosal atrophy with symptoms of increased nasal crusting occurred in 3 patients. Transection of varicose vessels in patients with nose bleeds leads to a decrease in the number of bleeds.

"input: Abstract: To determine whether the morphology of dermatophytes plays a role in the clinical manifestation of dermatophytosis, we isolated spores and mycelia from colonies of killed Trichophyton mentagrophytes and tested their ability to induce gross and microscopic cutaneous changes when applied to guinea pig skin. The skin of normal guinea pigs failed to develop any cutaneous changes after inoculation with either dead spores or mycelia. In contrast, guinea pigs that had recovered from a T. mentagrophytes infection reacted to topically applied spores by producing pustules but failed to develop pustules either grossly or microscopically when inoculated with mycelia. Because differences in the activation of C' and the subsequent generation of the polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) chemoattractant, C5a, might account for our in vivo findings, we measured the amount of C5a activated in vitro when serum was incubated with equivalent amounts of spores or mycelia. Spores consistently activated more C' to C5a than mycelia, although each could activate serum C'. The results support previous studies that show a direct correlation between the clinical manifestations of a dermatophytic infection and the development of immunity against the dermatophyte. Furthermore, the data suggest that a dermatophyte's predominant morphology during an infection may play a critical role in producing pustules by activating C' and chemoattracting PMNs into the fungus-laden stratum corneum.

The patients fell asleep after injecting the liquid contents of Placydil capsules (ethchlorvynol) and awoke several hours later with severe dyspnea. Arterial blood gases demonstrated marked hypoxia. Chest radiographs revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar densities. The patients' symptoms and radiographic findings resolved after several days of supportive care. Changes in the lung caused by ethchlorvynol may be the result of direct effect of the drug on the lung.

"input: Abstract: We have isolated a syngeneic monoclonal antibody (HepSS-1) reactive to a murine methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma, Meth-A. HepSS-1 also bound to a wide variety of established and fresh normal cells derived from not only mice but also other species such as human, monkey, rat, hamster, and chicken. Immunoprecipitation of surface iodinated Meth-A cell extract with HepSS-1, as well as Sepharose 4B gel chromatography of Meth-A cell extract and detection of antigens recognized by HepSS-1 by a sandwich-type radioimmunoassay revealed that the HepSS-1 antigens were composed of several molecular species, with one as large as approximately 10(6) daltons. The following evidence indicates that HepSS-1 specifically recognizes an epitope present in heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (HS-GAG). First, treatment of Meth-A cells with heparitinase or heparinase, but not with chondroitinase ABC or hyaluronidase, resulted in the loss of HepSS-1 binding. Second, HS-GAG but not seven other types of GAG (hyaluronic acid, heparin, chondroitin, chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and keratan sulfate) inhibited HepSS-1 binding to Meth-A cells. Third, HepSS-1 bound with HS-GAG but not with the seven other types of GAG. From the binding analysis of HepSS-1 to various modified HS-GAG and whale omega-heparin, it is additionally suggested that HepSS-1 recognizes an epitope closely related to O-sulfated and N-acetylated glucosamine. We found that NIH 3T3 cells expressed more HepSS-1 epitopes at a low cell density than at confluency and in G2 + M than in G1, whereas NIH 3T3 cells transformed with Kirsten-ras oncogene or SV-40 expressed high levels of HepSS-1 epitopes and ceased to show the density-dependent change in the amount of HepSS-1 epitopes. These observations were also reproduced by using NIH 3T3 cells transformed with a temperature sensitive Kirsten murine sarcoma virus maintained at permissive and non-permissive temperatures. Thus HepSS-1 is a first monoclonal antibody to HS-GAG and seems to be useful to elucidate changes in cell surface HS-GAG in normal cell growth and cell transformation.

"input: Abstract: The risk of developing spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (VT) and/or sudden death (""arrhythmic events"") was prospectively assessed in 165 patients who survived acute myocardial infarction. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms (ECGs) were performed before hospital discharge and then serially at regular intervals over the following year. In addition, 24 hr Holter monitoring was performed and left ventricular ejection fraction was determined. Sixty-five patients (group 1) had abnormal signal-averaged ECGs (voltage in the last 40 msec of the filtered QRS less than 20 microV or filtered QRS duration greater than 120 msec), 92 had normal signal-averaged ECGs (group 2), and eight had bundle branch block (excluded from analysis). In group 1, spontaneous normalization of the voltage in the last 40 msec of the QRS complex occurred in 30% of patients after 12 months, although total filtered QRS duration did not change overall. During follow-up of up to 20 months (median 11), seven patients died suddenly and six presented again with spontaneous, symptomatic VT. Eleven of 65 (17%) group 1 patients had an arrhythmic event compared with one of 92 patients (1%) in group 2 (p less than .001). The sensitivity of the signal-averaged ECG as a predictor of arrhythmic events was 92% with a specificity of 62%. Patients with subsequent arrhythmic events had considerably lower voltage in the last 40 msec of the QRS (11.0 +/- 8.3 vs 32.0 +/- 21.9 microV; p less than .001) than those without such events, and longer filtered QRS complexes (121 +/- 14 vs 105 +/- 12 msec; p less than .001). Multivariate logistic regression determined that the signal-averaged ECG provided independent prognostic information from the presence of complex ventricular ectopy and the degree of left ventricular dysfunction assessed at the time of hospital discharge. Signal-averaged ECGs provide important prognostic information in identifying patients at risk of arrhythmic events after myocardial infarction. Dynamic changes in the terminal QRS voltage are observed during the first year after myocardial infarction.

"input: Abstract: It is not uncommon for thyrotoxicosis to appear in an atypical manner in older patients. The classical symptoms are often absent. The disease is frequently characterized by cardiac, gastrointestinal, neuromuscular, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. As hyperthyroidism is readily amenable to effective treatment that can improve the quality of life, the clinical suspicion of this disease is always indicated and exclusion of this diagnosis should always be pursued. Recognizing the admittedly great difficulty in making, or even suspecting, the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in the elderly, our rule is to test for hyperthyroidism in essentially all geriatric patients presenting chronic systemic symptoms or signs. On the other hand, we do not recommend community-wide screening of persons over 60 for hyperthyroidism. Community-wide screening falls far below the break-even point in cost-benefit analysis. The most sensible detector of hyperthyroidism now widely available is the serum free T3 index (FT3I), but it may be falsely normal because of the effect of systemic illness on extrathyroidal T4-to-T3 conversion. The advent of ultrasensitive methods for TSH may change these statements considerably. It may become the single screening procedure for both hyper- and hypothyroidism.

"input: Abstract: The association between the morphometric dimensions of the external nose, including the thickness of the soft tissues, and various craniometric measurements has been examined on a sample of lateral radiographs of 154 males and 199 females from Vienna, Austria. In addition, the influence of age on morphometric dimensions and the soft tissue cover was tested. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that nasal height and nasal length are best predicted by the dimensions of the skull, whereas nasal depth and the thickness of the soft tissues is greatly influenced by age. In males, over 50% of the variance of nasal height and nasal length were accounted for by the height of the bony nose and the prominence of the ossa nasalia, and in females it was about 40%. Although the thickness of the soft tissue is dependent on exogenous factors, such as nutrition, mimicry, and so forth, the dimensions of the bony nose apparently also influence the skin depths to some extent. High and prominent noses were found to have a thinner layer of soft tissue over the nasal bones than short and less prominent ones. It thus seems as if there is a tendency of the soft tissue cover to adjust to disharmonies of the bony profile.

"input: Abstract: To determine the importance of reperfusion injury and the ability of the free-radical scavenger recombinant human superoxide dismutase (h-SOD) to prevent it, open-chest dogs underwent 90 min of proximal circumflex coronary artery occlusion, and only at the moment of reperfusion received either h-SOD (400,000 IU bolus into the left atrium followed by a 300,000 IU iv infusion over 1 hr) or saline. After 48 hr the surviving animals were killed and measurements were made of the risk region (by postmortem angiography) and infarct size (by gross pathology). All measurements were made by investigators blinded to treatment given, and the code was broken only at the end of the study. Hemodynamic variables and collateral flow during ischemia were similar in the two groups. Infarct size in control animals (n = 8) averaged 22.4 +/- 3.1% of the left ventricle and 52.2 +/- 7.1% of the risk region, compared with 13.3 +/- 0.8% of the left ventricle and 33.6 +/- 2.1% of the risk region in h-SOD-treated dogs (n = 8) (p less than .05). Infarcts in treated animals were not only smaller, but also exhibited a distinctive ""patchiness,"" suggesting protection along vascular distributions. Furthermore, analysis of the relationship between infarct size and collateral flow measured during ischemia in the two groups indicated that protection by h-SOD was greatest in animals with the lowest collateral flows. This study supports the concept that reperfusion of ischemic myocardium results in a separate component of cell damage, presumably linked to the generation of oxygen free radicals on reflow. Since the h-SOD preventable reperfusion component of injury was most pronounced in hearts with the most severe ischemia, scavenging of oxygen radicals at the time of reflow may offer a novel and particularly promising therapeutic approach for the protection of ischemic myocardium.

"input: Abstract: Prazosin, an antagonist of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor, has been found to suppress the clinical and histologic expression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the Lewis rat. This effect appears to be specific for the alpha 1-receptor. To determine the effect of this drug on vascular permeability to serum proteins and inflammatory cells, leakage of serum proteins into the central nervous system (CNS) was measured with [125I]albumin, and quantitation of cellular inflammation was determined by an estimation of total DNA. The results show that in both actively induced and passively transferred models of the disease, treatment with prazosin significantly suppresses leakage of serum proteins into the CNS but does not significantly suppress the increase of DNA. The results of the [125I]albumin studies additionally support the conclusion that the extent of vascular permeability to serum proteins in the spinal cord is a significant correlate of clinical disease. The results of the DNA estimation were at variance with the histologic evidence of cellular infiltration. We conclude that treatment with prazosin has a significant effect on the development of vascular edema in EAE. These results additionally validate a role for the adrenergic receptor in the development of EAE, and support the hypothesis that the primary site of action of prazosin is on the vascular alpha 1-adrenoceptor.

"input: Abstract: The possible role of prostaglandins in mediating large coronary artery vasodilation by nitrates was investigated by quantitative magnification coronary angiography. The effects of aspirin (1 g systemically and 100 mg intracoronary) in preventing large coronary artery vasodilation induced by intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate was investigated in 16 patients. Of these, 5 received 0.3 mg (Group 1A) and 11 received 3 mg (Group 1B) intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate, before and 15 minutes after aspirin. Relative to control, 0.3 mg isosorbide dinitrate induced a 19 +/- 9% (mean +/- SD) (p less than 0.01) and 19.5 +/- 11% (p less than 0.01) increase in coronary diameter before and after aspirin, respectively (p = NS). Changes after 3 mg isosorbide were 23 +/- 12% (p less than 0.01) and 26.5 +/- 14% (p less than 0.01), respectively, before and after aspirin (p = NS). In 10 additional patients (Group 2), the effect of the same dose of aspirin on rest coronary artery tone was assessed: changes relative to control were 0.9 +/- 5.5% (p = NS) minutes after aspirin. The intracoronary administration of 3 mg isosorbide dinitrate produced a 24.7 +/- 11% increase in coronary diameter (p = NS versus pre- and postaspirin isosorbide in Group 1B). Urinary 6-ketoprostaglandin-F1 alpha values in urine samples collected in the 8 hours before and the 8 hours after the study in five patients in Group 1B and five patients of Group 2, revealed a 36 +/- 14% (mean +/- SD) reduction in excretion of prostacyclin (p less than 0.01). These data rule out a role for prostaglandins both in mediating dilation of large coronary arteries by nitrates and in affecting their vascular tone at rest.

"input: Abstract: With 111In-labeled platelets and 125I-labeled bovine fibrinogen, regional mapping of platelet and fibrinogen deposition on leaflets and sewing rings was obtained. Ten Holstein calves received 25-mm mitral valves (ISLM) and were killed 1, 14, and 30 days after implantation. Twenty-four hours before the calves were killed, 350 to 450 microCi of 111In-labeled platelets and 200 to 250 microCi of 125I-labeled bovine fibrinogen were administered intravenously. The components of the tissue valves, i.e., three leaflets and sewing rings, were separated. Each leaflet was cut into four sections: free edge, central zone, flexion zone, and attachment zone. From the radioactivity in blood, leaflet zones, sewing rings, area of leaflet zones, platelet count, and fibrinogen level in blood, the mean regional density of adherent platelets, fibrinogen-fibrin, and fibrinogen/platelet were calculated. The density of platelets and fibrinogen deposited on the components of the valves decreases with time postimplantation. The number of fibrinogen molecules per platelet is fivefold to 20-fold higher than that of the receptor concentration on platelets on leaflet zones, suggesting the heterogeneity of fibrinogen-fibrin in thrombus and components of the valve.

"input: Abstract: Abnormal left ventricular diastolic performance, an early manifestation of hypertension in the heart, may precede the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. To assess effects of antihypertensive therapy on the heart, left ventricular mass (determined by echocardiography) and rapid left ventricular filling rate (determined by radionuclide ventriculography) were compared before and after 6 months of treatment of 16 patients. Nitrendipine (a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) was given alone or in combination with either propranolol or hydrochlorothiazide, or both, and significantly reduced blood pressure (156/103 +/- 12/7 to 137/89 +/- 10/6 mm Hg). In 6 of the 16 patients, left ventricular mass decreased by more than 10% (270 +/- 95 to 193 +/- 47 g, p less than 0.01); in the same patients, left ventricular filling rate increased (2.03 +/- 0.35 to 2.30 +/- 0.45 end-diastolic counts/s [EDC/s], p less than 0.01). In the one patient whose left ventricular mass increased (137 to 195 g), left ventricular filling rate decreased from 2.01 to 1.78 EDC/s. In the remaining nine patients who had no change in left ventricular mass, there was no significant changes in left ventricular filling. The changes in ventricular mass and filling could not be related to the extent of change in blood pressure or heart rate. These data suggest that regression of left ventricular mass during antihypertensive therapy with nitrendipine is accompanied by improved diastolic function.

"input: Abstract: This study investigates the hypothesis that, as a consequence of Parkinson's disease, disturbed caudate outflow will lead to deficits in cognitive functions dependent upon the integrity of the prefrontal cortex, the cortical focus of caudatofugal signals. Since Parkinson's disease also involves lesions in extra-striatal midbrain cells which reduce the extrinsic supply of dopamine to this cortical region, such functions are at double risk. Forty nondemented parkinsonian patients were drawn from a pool of 100 consecutive patients and matched with 40 normal control subjects according to age, education, IQ, and sex. All patients were quantitatively rated on neurological indices of disease. Neuropsychological assessment of the patient and normal groups included tests of general intelligence, psychomotor skills, memory, visuospatial and executive functions. No global cognitive decline was observed in the parkinsonian group. Moreover, memory and visuospatial abilities were generally intact. A small cluster of deficits emerged, interpreted as reflecting impairment in the ability to spontaneously generate efficient strategies when relying on self-directed task-specific planning. In addition, several tests thought to be sensitive to frontal lobe function distinguished patients with symptoms strongly lateralized to the right versus left side of the body. Deficits in strategic planning were later investigated in relation to severity of disease and to patient attributes including IQ and age, both of which were relevant to performance on specific tasks. Results were compared with previous investigations in parkinsonian patients and discussed from the perspective of both animal and human studies involving damage to the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. As the prefrontal cortex is thought to play a crucial role in self-directed behavioural planning, the validity of an outflow model in predicting the consequences of caudate nucleus dysfunction was supported.

"input: Abstract: Forty-three of 79 patients treated for clinically metastatic germ cell cancer survived for a median of 66 months (range, 52-83). In patients without previous chemotherapy the 5-year survival rate was 69%, whereas only 32% of patients with prior chemotherapy survived for 5 years. Limited disease, complete clinical response, histopathologically proven postchemotherapy tumor necrosis or complete resectability of a posttreatment mature teratoma indicated a favorable prognosis in patients without prior chemotherapy. Only 20% to 30% of the patients with less than a clinical complete response or with posttreatment residual malignant tumor can be salvaged by second line therapy. Posttreatment mature teratoma should be resected completely whenever possible, as this condition may lead to reactivation of the malignancy even after several years. Raynaud-like phenomena and/or gastrointestinal problems are the main long-term sequel (10%-15%) after modern multimodality treatment of advanced germ cell cancer (fertility-related problems are not considered here). In the majority of surviving patients, the lifestyle seems unaffected by the previous intensive treatment, evaluated about 5 years after discontinuation of all therapy.

"input: Abstract: Five children, aged 6 to 16 years, were tested for unilateral discrimination and interhemispheric transfer of tactile information as well as tactuomotor learning at various intervals before and after therapeutic callosotomy. Comparison of preoperative and postoperative capacities revealed that younger children are considerably less affected by the interruption of callosal transmission than older children. Bilateral organization of speech and participation of the anterior commissure can largely be excluded as possible compensatory mechanisms. The most plausible explanation for the excellent preservation of interhemispheric integration of tactile functions in the younger patients appears to be continued reliance on ipsilateral pathways. The relatively greater deficits observed in the older children, on the other hand, suggest that sensorimotor functions come to depend more extensively on contralateral pathways as the corpus callosum reaches functional maturity.

"input: Abstract: The IgG and IgM specific antibodies against a panel of 23 anaerobic gut bacteria were examined in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and healthy controls. Four of the organisms, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Coprococcus comes (ME46), Coprococcus comes (Sp4), and Eubacterium limosum gave abnormal antibody titres in Crohn's disease compared with those of controls. In Crohn's disease specific IgG antibodies to three of the organisms were low and the IgM antibodies were higher than those of controls. IgM antibodies were also raised in ulcerative colitis. Antigenic cross reactivity could be shown between some of these organisms. The possible clinical importance of these abnormal antibody responses to specific organisms is unexplained.

"input: Abstract: The concentration of interferon-alpha was measured by a specific two-site immunoradiometric assay in a variety of fluids and tissues collected during human pregnancy. Maternal blood and blood and tissues from non-pregnant adults contained little or no interferon-alpha. Fetal blood, fetal organs, placenta, membranes, amniotic fluid and decidua all contained significant and roughly equivalent amounts ranging from 1.1 to 10 u/ml (or per g of tissue). These findings demonstrate that the fetus and its immediate surroundings are permeated with interferon. It is suggested that this may play a role in regulation of the maternal-fetal graft relation.

"input: Abstract: Sixteen adult subjects with asthma in a clinical steady state were studied. On day 1, after baseline spirometry, they underwent four histamine inhalation tests with functional recovery between each test. The provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) was obtained after each test. On days 2, 3, and 4, after baseline spirometry, active and placebo ascorbic acid (2 gm) was administered orally, double-blind, according to a 4.3.1 two-treatment crossover study design. One hour later, spirometry was performed, and PC20 was reassessed. We found no significant changes in FEV1 and FVC after ascorbic acid as compared with placebo administration. There was no difference between PC20 on days 2, 3, and 4 and by standardizing for the four PC20 results obtained on day 1. We conclude that ascorbic acid has no acute bronchodilator effect and does not alter bronchial responsiveness to histamine in subjects with asthma.

"input: Abstract: A patient suffering baclofen overdose successfully treated with atropine is reported. Three hours after admission for ingestion of at least 300 mg baclofen as a single dose, the patient became comatose and subsequently bradycardic, hypotensive, and hypothermic. A prompt increase in heart rate and blood pressure followed administration of 1 mg of atropine sulfate. Atropine appears to be useful in treating cases of baclofen overdose complicated by bradycardia and hypotension.

"input: Abstract: We correlated the level of vitiligo antibodies to the extent of depigmentation in thirty-two patients with vitiligo. Vitiligo antibodies were assayed by protein A-sepharose immunoprecipitation method. Antibodies were present in four of eight (50%) patients with minimal vitiligo (less than 2% body surface involved), in nine of ten (90%) patients with moderate vitiligo (2 to 5% surface involved), and in thirteen of fourteen (93%) patients with more extensive disease (greater than 5% surface involved). The level of vitiligo antibodies in the three groups expressed as a binding index was 2.9% +/- 2.03, 5.6% +/- 2.92, and 8.0% +/- 3.03 SD, respectively. These results suggest that there is a relation between the incidence and level of vitiligo antibodies and the extent of depigmentation in vitiligo.

"input: Abstract: The cross-sectional relationship of endogenous androgens (testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate [DHEA-S]), estrogen (estradiol) and progestin (progesterone) to serum levels of lipoprotein cholesterol (very low-density [VLDL], low-density [LDL], and high-density lipoprotein [HDL]) and apolipoproteins (apo A-I and apo B) were studied in white (n = 251) and black (n = 258) adolescent boys, ages 11 to 17 years, as part of the Bogalusa Heart Study. Black boys had significantly higher levels of estradiol, HDL cholesterol, and apo A-I, and lower levels of androstenedione and VLDL cholesterol than white boys, independent of age and adiposity. Age was correlated strongly with testosterone and androstenedione, and moderately with DHEA-S and estradiol levels in both races. However, only in white boys was age consistently related to VLDL cholesterol (positively), HDL cholesterol (negatively), and apo A-I (negatively). Overall, testosterone was associated inversely with HDL cholesterol and apo A-I in white boys, while progesterone was related positively to apo A-I in both races after adjusting for age and adiposity. However, these relationships were found to differ with age. Partial correlations between levels of sex hormones and lipoproteins adjusted for age and adiposity showed no associations in the 11 to 12 year age group in boys of either race. A significant positive relation of testosterone to VLDL cholesterol, and inverse relations of testosterone to HDL cholesterol and apo A-I and DHEA-S to HDL cholesterol were apparent only in white boys in the 13 to 14 year age group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

"input: Abstract: Two patients with Behcet's syndrome had severe esophageal involvement. Both presented the complete clinical pattern (oral, genital, and eye lesions) of Behcet's syndrome. In both, esophageal lesions were associated with other gastrointestinal manifestations, in the first a transient episode of ulcerative ileitis, and in the second patient colitis. In both, the differential diagnosis with inflammatory bowel disease was very difficult. Histology of esophageal lesions was nonspecific; no vasculitis was found. Both patients improved on steroid therapy. Esophageal lesions also improved endoscopically and histologically with steroid therapy. When there is obvious gastrointestinal involvement in Behcet's syndrome, the differential diagnosis from inflammatory bowel disease is very difficult.

"input: Abstract: Traditional therapy for malignant pleural effusions includes thoracentesis or tube drainage with instillation of irritants to achieve pleurodesis. This can require a lengthy hospitalization, causes pain and discomfort, and has an appreciable failure rate. Because of these drawbacks, the authors used a shunting device to transfer fluid to the peritoneal cavity in 17 patients with malignant pleural effusions. Eleven patients had undergone previous therapeutic thoracenteses and three had chest tube placement with failed sclerosis. The shunt was a subcutaneous valved pump chamber with attached pleural and peritoneal catheters, which used manual compression to transfer fluid against the normal abdominal/pleural pressure gradient. Operative placement under local or general anesthesia was performed without complication. Five patients achieved minimal benefit, either because of moribund status or their inability to compress the pump effectively. In the other 12 patients, there was radiographic evidence of diminished or stabilized pleural effusion; respiratory symptoms were effectively palliated, and no further treatment for their effusion was required. Peritoneal dissemination of malignant cells has not been clinically detected. We feel that pleuroperitoneal shunting is a valid new method for treatment of malignant pleural effusions which can effectively palliate respiratory symptoms with low morbidity. Advantages include the absence of external tubing and the possibility for only a short hospitalization or even outpatient placement. Shunting is applicable for patients who are able to perform the requisite pumping and is particularly suitable for those with trapped lungs or who have failed attempted pleural sclerosis.

"input: Abstract: Neutrophils have been shown to express a receptor for C3dg that is distinct from CR2 and is termed complement receptor type 4 (CR4). In the present study, other peripheral blood cell types were examined by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry for the presence of C3dg binding activity. Specific uptake of C3dg occurred with neutrophils, platelets, and B lymphocytes, but not with eosinophils or T lymphocytes. Monocytes, contained within a mixed cell population of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and platelets, also bound C3dg, whereas purified monocytes did not. Binding of 125I-labeled glutaraldehyde-cross-linked C3dg to platelets was saturable, with an average of 1940 C3dg molecules bound per platelet at saturation (n = 8), ranging in number from 660 to 3930 molecules bound. Activation of platelets with thrombin did not consistently cause an increase in the expression of CR4 sites. 125I-C3dg binding to platelets was competitively inhibited equally well by unlabeled C3dg and iC3b, and approximately fourfold less well by C3b. The addition of platelets to elutriated monocytes generated C3dg binding activity on these cells by the formation of platelet-monocyte complexes. Thus, the CR4 on platelets accounted for the C3dg binding activity initially observed with partially purified monocytes. The adherent property of platelets may enable them to confer on certain other cell types the ability to localize C3dg-coated immune complexes or particles.

"input: Abstract: Of a total of 1561 patients registered in the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS) as of May 1983, 78 patients (5%) were younger than 1 year of age. These infants did not differ from the older children (1-20 years of age) in male/female ratio, clinical grouping, or survival rates. Infants younger than 1 year of age had a significantly greater frequency of undifferentiated sarcoma, 18% versus 7% in older children (P less than 0.005). Infants also had a significantly greater proportion of cancers with botryoid pathology, 10% versus 4% in older children (P less than 0.005). When reviewed by the newly proposed IRS cytopathologic classification, there was no difference in pathologic types between the two age groups. Infants younger than 1 year of age had a higher rate of bladder-prostate-vagina primary tumor sites than older children, 24% versus 10% (P less than 0.05). In addition, infants tended to receive less of the prescribed doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy than older children, and to develop more toxicity to treatment than older children. Despite these differences, the overall survival curve for the two age groups appears to be similar. In contrast to Wilms' tumor and neuroblastoma, in which age (less than 1 year) is a favorable prognostic factor, age does not appear to be an important prognostic factor in rhabdomyosarcoma.

"input: Abstract: I have suggested that the X-linked gene Tabby (Ta) and its autosomal mimics in the mouse may be homologous with the genes for sex-linked anhidrotic (hypohidrotic) ectodermal dysplasia (Christ-Siemens-Touraine syndrome, CST) and its apparent autosomal mimics in the human. In the present study, I examined whether anhidrosis, a cardinal feature of CST, is present in the putative mouse sex-linked model, Tabby. The results demonstrate that whereas normal mice perspire on the volar and plantar surfaces of their paws, hemizygous Ta/Y male mice show anhidrosis and absence of sweat glands, as do human hemizygous male sufferers of CST. This result is strongly supportive of the hypothesis that Ta is homologous to the gene for CST.

"input: Abstract: In 37 patients with seemingly localized non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the Waldeyer's ring (WR-NHL), lymphangiography (LAG) and/or gallium-67 scans (Ga-67 scans) were done. Before these procedures, 20 patients were diagnosed as Stage I, and 17 as Stage II. LAG was done for 30, and Ga-67 scans for 32, 25 of whom had both. Five patients (16%) were upstaged to Stage III or IV by Ga-67 scans. Only one (3%) had abnormal LAG findings, in whom Ga-67 scans also showed abnormal accumulation in the para-aortic region. Because of this low positive rate, LAG is not recommended for staging of WR-NHL.

"input: Abstract: Concentrations of catecholamines in vitreous fluid and urine in guinea pigs dying of cold and the effects of freezing and autolysis on these parameters were studied. The analysis was performed by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Noradrenaline (NA) concentration in vitreous fluid was more than 20 times higher in the cold exposed animals than in controls (44.2 +/- 9.2 versus 2.0 +/- 1.0 ng/mL). Autolysis alone caused an increase to 33.5 +/- 7.7 ng/mL, and freezing alone to 13.4 +/- 5.3 ng/mL. The highest values were in the group with exposure, freezing, and autolysis. Adrenaline (A) concentration in the vitreous fluid increased fourfold (3.9 +/- 1.5 versus 0.7 +/- 0.5 ng/mL) in cold exposure and twofold as a result of autolysis. Dopamine (DA) concentration in vitreous fluid was elevated only in the group with exposure, freezing, and autolysis. The increase of NA concentration in urine was fivefold during the whole exposure (from 19.4 +/- 6.9 to 109 +/- 57.3 ng/mL), but A was increased by twentyfold (from 10 +/- 5.1 to 213.2 +/- 168.7 ng/mL), whereas DA concentration did not change. The increase of average excretion of NA to urine was eightfold during the first 6 h of exposure, and that of A tenfold. According to the present results, elevated concentrations of catecholamines in the vitreous fluid and urine can be used as a diagnostic aid for hypothermia death. Concerning the values of noradrenaline in the vitreous, the increase as a result of autolysis must be taken in account when interpreting the results.

"input: Abstract: A three-year review of toxicology data from medical examiner autopsies in Pima County, Arizona, has demonstrated that cocaine has rapidly become a leading substance of abuse, second only to alcohol in the frequency of drugs detected by toxicologic analysis of all suspicious deaths, motor vehicle accident fatalities, homicides, and suicides. Gastric contents and urine were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography, and nasal swabs, blood, and urine were tested for the combination of cocaine and its metabolite benzoylecgonine by quantitative radioimmunoassay. A total of seventy-two deaths in Pima County from 1982 to 1984 have involved cocaine. Seventy percent of these have occurred in the last fifteen months. Marked variation in the individual response to cocaine compared to the blood concentration of cocaine/metabolite was noted.

No patient developed postoperative jaundice. Sixty-nine children were exposed to two halothane anaesthetics within 28 days on 149 occasions and serial estimations of serum liver enzyme concentrations were obtained. Minor increases in the concentrations of serum AST and ALT were recorded in 10.6% and 4.7% of patient entries, respectively. Postoperative GGT and SAP concentrations were increased in 2.7% of patient entries. Patients in whom enzyme values were increased before the first anaesthetic were no more likely than other subjects to develop further changes.

"input: Abstract: Parts of the United Kingdom have the highest incidence, prevalence and mortality rates for multiple sclerosis in the world. Although methods of ascertainment are not standardised, regional differences and changes with time are present for each of these statistics. Mortality has declined, whereas prevalence and hospital discharge rates have increased owing in part to the improved survival but also to better case ascertainment. The gradient in prevalence seen between Southern England (63/10(5)), Northern England and Northern Ireland (76-79/10(5)), Wales (c. 113/10(5)), North-East Scotland (155/10(5)) and the Orkneys (258/10(5)) can in part be attributed to varying methods of ascertainment but correlates with regional differences in the frequency of HLA-DR2 in normal individuals (21-50%). However no HLA-DR2 association is observed in parts of Scotland, where the prevalence is the highest in the United Kingdom, because HLA-DR2 and linked genes occur in up to 50% of the normal population from these areas. If the aetiology of multiple sclerosis is multifactorial the frequency of the disease will increase where susceptibility genes are common because the probability of concurrence of the remaining critical events is high; conversely when each aetiological agent is infrequent the chance of them all occurring in the same individual and therefore incidence of the disease are both lower. The fall in incidence observed in the Orkney Islands, possibly reflecting decline in an exogenous agent interacting with susceptibility factors, is consistent with this multifactorial hypothesis.

"input: Abstract: The reported incidence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is higher than that of the general population. Unusual susceptibility to PUD in RA, independent of therapy, has been suggested. To compare RA patients with others who had similar drug exposure but no known predisposition to PUD, 120 patients hospitalized for treatment of severe arthritis (65 with RA, 55 with osteoarthritis) were assessed by questionnaire for PUD history, drug history and other relevant variables. The relationship of PUD to sex distribution, smoking, alcohol consumption and anti-inflammatory therapy followed expected patterns. We found high but similar PUD rates in RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients (RA 15%, OA 18%). This suggests that a common factor (probably drugs) is responsible. We feel that the documented high incidence of PUD in RA is most probably related to drug therapy. Available methods cannot determine if PUD ever occurs as a primary manifestation of RA.

"input: Abstract: Considerable effort has been expended in recent years by a number of laboratories to improve methods of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This article briefly summarizes 5 years of investigation by our group on hemodynamic support during external cardiac massage. In most studies, long-term canine preparations were used, and implanted transducers allowed precise hemodynamic measurements. Although cardiac output was depressed with all CPR methods, manual chest compressions of high velocity, moderate force, and brief duration at a rate of 120/min seemed to optimize systemic and coronary blood flow. This method was termed high-impulse CPR. High-impulse techniques now have been applied extensively in the clinical setting, and preliminary observations also support their efficacy in man. Based on this experience, it is suggested that the American Heart Association guidelines be changed to recommend a manual chest compression rate of 120/min during closed-chest cardiac massage.

"input: Abstract: Because mast cells (MCs) in skin of atopic dogs are heterogeneous with respect to tissue fixation and staining properties, we determined the effect of antigen on each type of MC in vivo. Skin biopsies were done in anesthetized, ragweed-sensitized dogs before and at 1, 3, 6, and 24 hours after intradermal injections of ragweed antigen (n = 5) or glycerin diluent (n = 4). In each case, one biopsy specimen was fixed with formalin, and a second specimen from an adjacent abdominal site was fixed with basic lead acetate. In sections stained with Alcian blue, 49.7% more MCs (p less than 0.05) were detected in tissue fixed with basic lead acetate (""typical"" plus ""atypical"" MCs: 2916 +/- 581/mm3; mean +/- SEM) than in tissue fixed with formalin (""typical"" MCs: 1955 +/- 537/mm3). After antigen, the number of ""typical"" MCs detectable in tissue sections progressively decreased during the 24-hour period, whereas the number of ""atypical"" MCs was lowest at 1 hour and had increased at 24 hours. After diluent, MC numbers did not change significantly over time. A late-phase response (LPR), detected clinically as induration and edema, was present 6 hours after antigen in four of five dogs, but LPR was not detected after diluent. The size of LPR was correlated (r = 0.85; p less than 0.05) with the decrease in the number of ""typical"" MCs at 6 hours. We conclude that the response of the ""typical"" and ""atypical"" MC to antigen in vivo differs markedly. The ""atypical"" MCs participate in the early, acute response to antigen, and the ""typical"" MCs may be associated with the development of the LPR.
