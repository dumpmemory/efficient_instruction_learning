 Person2:No , thank you . I had too much to drink yesterday evening . I had a bad hangover this morning . My head felt terrible .  
 Person1:        Were you celebrating something ?  
 Person2:Yes . It was a friend ’ s birthday party . We drank all kinds of things-beer , wine and spirits . After midnight , we were even drinking cocktails !  
 Person1:        It ’ s a bad idea to drink a combination of alcoholic drinks . You should stick with one for the whole evening .  
 Person2:I know , but it was a celebration , you Kwon ? I don ’ t think I ’ Ve see you drunk .  
 Person1:        I usually only drink beer and I rarely drink more than a few pints .  
 Person2:You are a sensible drinker . Anyway , I ’ m not going to drink any alcohol this evening . I don ’ t ’ want another bad hangover .  
 Person1:        Let me buy you a soft drink then . How about a coke ?  
 Person2:Yeah . That ’ s a good idea . I heard that coke was first used as a medicine .  
 Person1:        Rally ? ... barman ! ... a large coke with ice and lemon , please ... thanks . Here ’ s the money .  
 Person2:Are you going to the wine tasting tomorrow ?

 Person2:Pleased to see you , too , Mr . Brown .  
 Person1:        You've had a good trip , I hope .  
 Person2:Yes , a very pleasant journey , thank you .  
 Person1:        It's been a full two years since we last saw each other .  
 Person2:So it is , I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years .  
 Person1:        We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement .  
 Person2:I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products .  
 Person1:        Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line .  
 Person2:Thank you .  
 Person1:        But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end .  
 Person2:That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ?  
 Person1:        500 pieces .  
 Person2:No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts .  
 Person1:        All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission .  
 Person2:I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged .  
 Person1:        We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own .  
 Person2:No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction .  
 Person1:        Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products .  
 Person2:Yes , we've already prepared one . I've brought it with me . I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow .  
 Person1:        Good , that's all then .  
 Person2:Good .

 Person1:        I never eat breakfast though .

"input:  Person1:       What do you think of the way people use and treat animals ?  
 Person2:I think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . When we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor .  
 Person1:        Perhaps people should stop eating animals . We could grow more crops .  
 Person2:What would you do with all the animals ? You couldn ’ t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet .  
 Person1:        We could provide them with better conditions anyway . We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible .  
 Person2:That ’ s true . I think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals .  
 Person1:        I agree . I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo . I don ’ t like animals experiments though . I believe that we can do tests in other ways .  
 Person2:I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced .  
 Person1:        That ’ s good news . The good thing is that most people treat their pets well .

 Person1:        Have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals .

 Person2:Thank you , Bob ! This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many , a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world . In Switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the Alps . Fortunately , no one was injured . Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled . Moving to to Latin American , Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country . In Chile , a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region . Losses are reported to be in the billions . Authorities have not yet released an official statement .

 Person2:Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee .  
 Person1:        No , we don't , especially the old people . But more and more young people fall for coffee .  
 Person2:I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffeehouses in China now .

"input:  Person1:       Do you have much experience with kids ?  
 Person2:Yes . I have three sons . Actually I also have a grandson .  
 Person1:        To tell you the truth , sometimes I regret having a baby so early . I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby .  
 Person2:I understand . I was in your position before . At that time I couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . My husband seldom stayed at home .  
 Person1:        What about your mother ? Did she help you ?  
 Person2:Yes , she did a little . But you see , Americans are different from Chinese . You can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . She could baby-sit only once or twice a week . That ’ s it . I had to care for them most of the time .  
 Person1:        I see . So if my little family goes to America , I would end up taking care of my child all the time . My husband would have to make the bread for us . I just don ’ t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day .  
 Person2:Don ’ t worry . You can take night classes . I did that when I had kids . And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . Then you could find a job and work .  
 Person1:        Sounds not so easy to me . When that happens , I will be too old to learn .  
 Person2:No . You see , I went back to school to get my Master ’ s Degree when I was in my thirties . You won ’ t be older than that .

 Person1:        Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops .  
 Person2:Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , butoften times I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine .  
 Person1:        True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ?  
 Person2:Not funny .

"input:  Person1:       So , you friend ’ s getting married on Saturday . What have you bought her as a wedding gift . I find is so hard to choose the right gift .  
 Person2:My friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name by the item they will buy .  
 Person1:        That ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ?  
 Person2:Most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home .  
 Person1:        So , what did you get them ?  
 Person2:I bought a sewing machine . I know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems .  
 Person1:        What ’ s wrong with it ?  
 Person2:She says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . When she uses it , it makes a funny noise .  
 Person1:        Household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays .  
 Person2:I think it ’ s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . Because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances don ’ t need to last more than five or ten years at most .

 Person2:We import a little oil from Venezuela , but we are fairly self-sufficient . We import some iron and a lot of aluminium from neighbouring countries .  
 Person1:        I heard that you country recently discovered deposits of precious stone .  
 Person2:Yes , that ’ s right . So far , only small deposits have been found . Engineers in my country are focusing on drilling for oil . The government is keen to exploit our natural resources to get money to improve our country .  
 Person1:        If your government invests in your country ’ s infrastructure , it will be money well spent .  
 Person2:Yes . We need to put the money into long-term projects rather than wasting it on short-term ones .

Usually it only lasts a day or two before both sides can come to an agreement and we start work again . Anyhow , it's a nice , unanticipated holiday ...

 Person1:        Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ?  
 Person2:Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it .  
 Person1:        Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right .  
 Person2:It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make .  
 Person1:        Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy .  
 Person2:That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs .  
 Person1:        And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common .  
 Person2:Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college .  
 Person1:        Well , at least going to college won't be too bad . Since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college .

 Person1:        Did you have any difficulty getting along with fellow students or teachers ?  
 Person2:No . Not at all . I'm quite easy-going .  
 Person1:        What's your strong points ?  
 Person2:Oh , I'm very responsible , I can make fast decisions , and I do not need much supervision . I enjoy completing challenging tasks .  
 Person1:        What do you dislike most about your job ?  
 Person2:Probably routine , dull work . Oh , I am much more enthusiastic if I'm given a challenge and responsibility .  
 Person1:        What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a supervisor and employee ?  
 Person2:A friendly one . I think an open , friendly , honest relationship should exist . An employee should feel she ( he ) can go to her ( his ) boss anytime with any kind of question .  
 Person1:        Sometimes working with a foreign company can be stressful . Foreigners tend to get excited or angry easily , and they show it . Are you sure you can handle this stress ? How do you deal with conflict in your present job ?  
 Person2:Well , there's a lot of stress in a Chinese company also , although much of it is below the surface . I have confidence in my ability to handle conflict . If I have a problem with a co-worker , I do everything I can to work it out directly with that person . If I am unable to work it out , then I ask a supervisor to help out . If my boss shouts at me , I try not to take it personally . I try my best to understand the stress he is under . It's kind of like being in a family . Often family members say things in the heat of the moment , but don't mean what they say . A company is like a family , it has good times and bad times .  
 Person1:        How do you feel about overtime work ?  
 Person2:That's no problem . I know that every company has busy periods . When this happens , I'm ready to put in as much time as necessary to get the job done .  
 Person1:        What is most important to you in a job ?  
 Person2:I want to feel that I am making a real contribution to the company , so I would like my boss to trust me with important work .  
 Person1:        Do you think that you are introverted or extroverted ?  
 Person2:I'm quite outspoken . I enjoy calling a spade a spade and hate talking in a roundabout way . So I'd call myself outgoing .  
 Person1:        Under what kind of circumstance will you lose your temper ?  
 Person2:Seldom . But I hate someone's frequently being late or lazy .  
 Person1:        OK . What are your strong points ?  
 Person2:Hmm . as I mentioned , I can work well under pressure and I enjoy work that challenges me . I think that my English ability is also a strong point .  
 Person1:        And your weaknesses ?  
 Person2:I think I sometimes try to be over-organized . So I am learning how to let some things go and concentrate on the most important part of my job .

 Person1:        Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed .  
 Person2:Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom .

 Person2:You might consult your bank and see if you could reduce the required deposit to a minimum .  
 Person1:        Anyhow , there would be certain bank charges . We've done business for years and you should have some faith in our credit . It would help me greatly , if you could accept D / A or D / P . It makes no difference to you , but it does to me .  
 Person2:Well . As you understand , the irrevocable L / C gives the exports additional protection of the banker ’ s guarantee . We always ask for L / C for our exports , and the other way around , we pay by L / C for our imports . We only accept L / C for regular orders .

 Person2:The thing is , I've got all of this information here , all of these leaflets , but I can't make head nor tail of them !  
 Person1:        I see . What is it exactly that you are interested in ?  
 Person2:I'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit .  
 Person1:        Well , that all depends on how much you want to invest .  
 Person2:I was thinking of around 10,000 RIB .  
 Person1:        That's a nice round figure to deal with ! OK , if you were to buy this insurance policy , your yearly fixed income from it would be 94.35 RIB .  
 Person2:And for the Savings Deposit ?  
 Person1:        For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more . You see , in time deposit , the interest rate is 1.58 % after the 20 % interest tax . So , technically you could get more than a third more .  
 Person2:Wow ! A third more ? Very good .

 Person2:I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling !  
 Person1:        What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ?  
 Person2:It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ?  
 Person1:        January 5th .  
 Person2:Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers !  
 Person1:        That ’ s bogus . I don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .  
 Person2:No , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize .  
 Person1:        Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ?  
 Person2:A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you !

 Person2:I see ! Do you want to ask her out ?  
 Person1:        sure , but how ?  
 Person2:you can ask her out for drink after work .  
 Person1:        but for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am .  
 Person2:then you've got a lot of homework to do . You need to get her notice first .  
 Person1:        easier said than done .  
 Person2:you can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her .  
 Person1:        but I always get tongue-tied when I see her .  
 Person2:that's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased .

 Person1:        Are all these helpful for the interview ?  
 Person2:Of course . The manner of shaking hands can show a man ’ s character . For example , the interviewer who shakes your hand lightly , is a easygoing man although he looks cool .  
 Person1:        Anything else ?  
 Person2:You can discover interviewer's eyes because they can show his thoughts , and can judge whether he is interested in your words by his gesture and mien .

"input:  Person1:       Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning . But people have different views about lifelong learning . How do you understand lifelong learning ?  
 Person2:I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning  
 Person1:        Does that mean studying all the time ?  
 Person2:I don't think so . I think it's about your attitude towards learning . One should be open to new ideas , decisions , skills or behaviors .

 Person1:        Oh , really ? I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert , painting , handwriting , reading novels and reading fashion magazines . What about yours ?  
 Person2:I have fewer hobbies than yours . That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting .  
 Person1:        Oh , you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ?  
 Person2:That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic .  
 Person1:        I quite agree with you . With our hobbies , our life can be more colorful and exciting .  
 Person2:And I can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend .  
 Person1:        Yes , it's a good habit to have a life-long hobby . Those who practise calligraphy and Qigong always live longer .

 Person2:What are bar vouchers ?  
 Person1:        Paying club members get around 300 dollars a year in restaurant vouchers.The vouchers can be used in the restaurant or the lounge.But we don't offer vouchers to employees .

"input:  Person1:       Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background .  
 Person2:I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used .  
 Person1:        What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ?  
 Person2:Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input .  
 Person1:        Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ?  
 Person2:There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort .  
 Person1:        Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome .  
 Person2:I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done .  
 Person1:        What are your strengths and weaknesses ?  
 Person2:My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more .  
 Person1:        Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss .  
 Person2:I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day .  
 Person1:        When do you find a job satisfying ?  
 Person2:My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner .  
 Person1:        How would your coworkers describe you ?  
 Person2:First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously .  
 Person1:        Do you have any questions ?  
 Person2:Yes , I do . On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ?

 Person2:One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet !  
 Person1:        When I do push-ups , should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ?  
 Person2:You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend their bodies at the waist , which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise .  
 Person1:        What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ?  
 Person2:One that I recommend is that you lie on your back . You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out either side of your body .  
 Person1:        So I need plenty of space for this exercise .  
 Person2:Yes , you do . Lift the weight up , keeping your arms straight all the time .  
 Person1:        Great . Thanks for you advice !

 Person2:Oh , I didn't actually teach in the schools . I taught after school . I taught in English institutes .  
 Person1:        But you taught children , yes ?  
 Person2:Yes . That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America.At least as far as studying is concerned.Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school .  
 Person1:        They actually study after school ?  
 Person2:That's right.After their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or English.They are very serious about learning over there .  
 Person1:        Hmm . That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . Don't they ever relax ?  
 Person2:Of course they do.You know , Eliza , before I went over there I thought the same thing . I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much.But now that I've worked there , and taught them , I feel it is a good thing.Their parents are very concerned about their education . More than American parents are . And that is good . American kids don't study enough .  
 Person1:        Asian cultures value learning very much . I know that .  
 Person2:So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education.They would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing . I don't think that's a bad thing . I think it's a good thing.In America , too many parents don't pay attention .  
 Person1:        But aren't the kids tired out ? I mean , they go to school all day , and then they go to school in the evening too .  
 Person2:As an English teacher , I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible . I tried to have a good time with my classes . The students often enjoyed it.And if the students enjoyed it , they learned more . So it was a good experience .  
 Person1:        Are the kids in Taiwan very obedient ?  
 Person2:That's a stereotype we Americans have.We think that Asian kids are very obedient and quiet.But it's not true . There are plenty of naughty kids too .  
 Person1:        Hmm . I know you taught in Costa Rica also.Which did you like better--Costa Rica or Taiwan ?

 Person1:        Should we start with beer or wine or go straight to the hard liquor ?  
 Person2:I think I'll have a glass of wine . Let's see ... they have red wine , white wine and port . They even have sangria ! It's the happy hour special .  
 Person1:        Port's too sweet . It's a dessert wine . A dry red French wine would be nice with meat . A glass of chilled white German wine would be good with fish . But , we're not eating and it's hot out , so I think I'll have a tall glass of sangria with ice .  
 Person2:Good choice ! But , what's your favorite kind of hard liquor ?  
 Person1:        I like to stick to the clean stuff , like vodka , gin , white rum and other clear spirits .

 Person2:Yes , it is . But we need to take out more water . So it then passes through a series of rollers , where more water is squeezed out .

 Person1:        Yes . If a tornado has been spotted , they announce a "" tornado warning "" . So if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere .

 Person2:But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ?  
 Person1:        Maybe . It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast .  
 Person2:Have you seen a lot of them ?  
 Person1:        I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone .  
 Person2:Did it hit their house ?

"input:  Person1:       How did you get around over there ? Did you rent cars ?  
 Person2:No , that would be too expensive . We used the train system.We bought a special pass called a Enrail pass . It lets people use the train wherever they want , as often as they want .  
 Person1:        I've heard about Enrail passes.So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot .  
 Person2:Yes , they do . I wish we Americans had a better train system .  
 Person1:        I know . Our train system is lousy.And besides , Americans love their cars too much .  
 Person2:I agree . And probably the automobile companies are too powerful.They never allowed the government to develop trains .  
 Person1:        It's too bad for the environment . So much pollution from cars .  
 Person2:Americans love cars for different reasons , I think.One reason is that we are very individualistic.And cars are a very individual way of getting around.Americans like the freedom of driving around by themselves.They don't want to ride in a train or bus with a group of people .  
 Person1:        Yes , I agree . I think it is a cultural characteristic.It would be very hard to get us Americans to change this.But you know what ? Probably , in the future , Americans will have to change .  
 Person2:Why do you say "" have to "" ?  
 Person1:        Because the earth's environment can't tolerate cars forever . I think cars are already causing global warming.When the problem gets more serious , world governments will have to start limiting car use .  
 Person2:Maybe you're right . They will have to develop alternative transportation.But it will be hard in America . Too many people are used to cars.Even in our movies cars are very important .

 Person1:        Could you tell me the usual procedures to handle such a case ?  
 Person2:Yes , on the shipper's side , when the cargos arrives , all relevant documents will be forwarded to the consignee.Among other things , this party has to check carefully the content of the packing list and weight list.When cargos are found to be damaged of short landed , this party has to call for a joint survey by representatives of the shipping company and the insurance agent.Based on the survey report , they will lodge a clam for compensation .  
 Person1:        If you act as our representative what would you do to safeguard our interest ?  
 Person2:I think , first of all , I would ask the consignee to produce survey report on loading , if they can't produce that I would suggest them to refer the case to their shipper . Meanwhile , bad weather could be agood excuse to refuse the responsibility .

"input:  Person1:       Are the galaxies in the universe moving through space ?  
 Person2:No , the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them . But not too much . As the space between galaxies expands , it carries the galaxies further apart - like raisins in an expanding dough .  
 Person1:        But I heard that our Milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy . If galaxies are moving apart from each other , how can they collide ?  
 Person2:Well , the universe is a chaotic place , and the gravity from one galaxy , or from a group of galaxies , may disturb the motion of its near neighbors , causing them to collide . However , on average , when you compare two large enough chunks of space , the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other .

 Person1:        We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . There ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . Developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environment protection .  
 Person2:Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking about the long-term damage to the forests . We should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life .  
 Person1:        In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . In means that people cannot grow enough food .

 Person2:Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ?  
 Person1:        Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed .  
 Person2:Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom .

 Person2:I wish it could be Germany . But it seems they are not in a very good conditions .  
 Person1:        No , they aren't . They had a hard time in the group stage and only sealed a sit in the eighth-finals with Wallack ' s header in the final three minutes . Just think , group A consists of Austria , China , and Saudi Arabia , all of which are minnows .  
 Person2:It seems they've been out of luck since the beginning of the event . Their shots hit the woodwork as many as six times . Oh . my goodness ! I'm afraid the team is under a spell .  
 Person1:        Well , at least the Germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield . They recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against Austria . And they to be endowed with perfect positional sense . I think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later .  
 Person2:I agree . Eeven though German attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders , they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate , well-timed passes .  
 Person1:        That's why I still have very high hopes for the team . Now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock-out stage , the Germans will probably make it through to the finals .  
 Person2:Yes . They have a good reputation for their tenacity and discipline , especially in vital , decisive encounters .

 Person1:        Hummum ... I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about that.Anyway ... now that I'm going to have to make some claims , I think I'd better try and understand how the system works . Would you mind breaking it down for me ?  
 Person2:Sure . Basically we have two insurance policies for employees ... workman's compensation and medical insurance . The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation , and for a significant part of the medical coverage , but you pay part of that premium , too .  
 Person1:        That's the charge for insurance I see on my pay slip each month , right ?  
 Person2:Yep . Every country in the world has a different system , but here we buy insurance from a private provider .  
 Person1:        So workman's compensation is if I slip and break my arm while working in the office or on the job , right ?

 Person2:We've heard about that festival before . It would be quite helpful if you could give us some highlights of the festival .  
 Person1:        My pleasure . Well , the festival is going to start on the third Saturday of October , and covers over one hundred diverse programs in one month .  
 Person2:What do you think we can see during the festival ?  
 Person1:        I don't know what to suggest . There're so many attractions , and they all sound interesting . One exciting program might be the Ten Thousand People Cycling round the Town . You can choose from the five routes that lead to different destinations .  
 Person2:I'd like to take the one that goes to the Wild Animal Park .  
 Person1:        Then you can take Route No . 5 . Next I would suggest the International Dragon Boat Race where you can watch Lion Dance , Dragon Boat racing , and many other water shows .  
 Person2:Wow , must be interesting to watch dragon boats compete a-gainst one another on the city river .

"input:  Person1:       Do you believe in god ?  
 Person2:Not at all . I ’ m an agnostic . Do you ?  
 Person1:        I ’ m not sure . Why don ’ t you believe there is a god ?  
 Person2:I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one .  
 Person1:        I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet .  
 Person2:I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong .  
 Person1:        For example ?  
 Person2:Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics .  
 Person1:        Yes . Such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs .

 Person1:        Why not ? I downloaded a beautiful song the other day . We can learn it together now .

"input:  Person1:       I think the government needs a radical plan to improve things . The government just talks , but in the long run , nothing is done to improve the economy .

 Person1:        Well , income taxes were decreased last year in hope to give the economy a boost , but I think it's backfired . The immediate effect of the tax reduction was to cause inflation to rise .  
 Person2:The worst part is that the inflation hurts the poor more than the rich . It also leads to more unemployment in the long run . I don't know what a good solution would be to make the economy more vibrant again ...

Stick to about three or four points , give an overview of the points , then present them one by one , and then summarize at the end . Be straightforward and organized and you're sure to be remembered .  
 Person1:        What kind of visuals should I use to support the presentation ? Do you think I should use PowerPoint ?  
 Person2:You should consider the size and interests of your audience . In other words , who is listening , and what do they want to hear ... you can put together a PPT with some graphics and animations that will catch people's attention , but be careful not to go overboard .  
 Person1:        I think I can put something together , no problem . But when it comes to tomorrow , I'll just be a bundle of nerves ! How can I get over my fear of speaking in public ?  
 Person2:You know , stage fright is very normal , most people get nervous before they have to speak in front of large groups . Just prepare well , rehearse beforehand , and trust that you will be great ... and you will be !

Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars .

"input:  Person1:       Hello everyone , and welcome to our CPR for beginners course.First of all , does anyone know what CPR stands for ?  
 Person2:Cardiopulmonary resuscitation !  
 Person1:        That ’ s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest .  
 Person2:What does that mean ?  
 Person1:        Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ’ s begin ! I need a volunteer .  
 Person2:Me ! Me !  
 Person1:        Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this .  
 Person2:Wait , what are you doing ? I ’ m a married woman ! You can ’ t just try to kiss me like this !  
 Person1:        Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency .  
 Person2:Well , OK . But no French kissing !  
 Person1:        As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ’ s chest , and press down firmly two or three times .  
 Person2:Wait , what are you doing ! You can ’ t just kiss me then go for second base !

 Person2:They ’ re both harder than reading or writing .  
 Person1:        In what way ?  
 Person2:Because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of English .  
 Person1:        You are making me feel really discouraged .  
 Person2:I ’ m not trying to discourage you . I ’ m trying to help you . You have to live with these difficulties . Isn ’ t it better to know about them ? The more you know about what you have to face , the better you ’ ll do . I promise !

 Person2:I don't think this mall has a leather goods store.So we have to go to State Street .  
 Person1:        Alright . We can go later then .  
 Person2:We can buy something for Mom and Dad here , and then go buy Uncle Teddy's gift on State Street .

 Person2:Me ! Me !  
 Person1:        Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this .

"input:  Person1:       The company is selecting three employees to attend the marketing seminar next month . Did you put your name in for it ?  
 Person2:No , I don't really care too much for seminars ... I find them to be either boring ot useless . I mean , how much can you really learn in one afternoon ?  
 Person1:        It's not just about the things that you learn , you know ... seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation . You can learn a few things , but more importantly , you rub shoulders with the business leaders and make contacts that could lead to potential sales or partnerships in the future . The social mixers are always more important than the seminars anyway .

 Person1:        Well , no.it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ?  
 Person2:You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc .  
 Person1:        Well , that seems easy enough .  
 Person2:Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea .  
 Person1:        Geez . Is that all ?  
 Person2:Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !  
 Person1:        Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !

I've heard people say that in L . A . , everyone is from somewhere else . Tha's partly true . So , I've met all kinds of people here . What I'm realizing is that the picture of L .

 Person2:I don ’ t know . What do you think ?  
 Person1:        I think a Chinese student concentrates on written English , and uses it as a basis for communicating . From start to finish he ’ s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . This is a very difficult way to learn .  
 Person2:What do natives get ?  
 Person1:        They get higher level English , which is more formal than everyday spoken English . They also deal with matters of style and creativity .  
 Person2:Do you mean that a native doesn ’ t make any mistakes in grammar ?  
 Person1:        Absolutely not ! Native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes , especially if they come from a home where nonstandard English is spoken .  
 Person2:I suppose that only a small percentage of college students don ’ t know standard English in American universities .  
 Person1:        Actually there are more non-native speakers than you think . That ’ s why it ’ s so important to quit worrying about making mistakes . Just talk to everyone every chance you get .

 Person2:I think we should discourage people from using their private cars . They produce too much pollution !

 Person2:Cars might be convenient , but they're so bad for the environment .

 Person2:It is , I'll tell you why . We'll have to call in the electrician , he's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5PM , and it will probably take him an hour a light . Plus , the halogen lights take more electricity , so your electrical cost is going to be higher as well .  
 Person1:        Can't you give me a break on this ? We've already spent so much money on lighting , I hate to have to blow so much more on halogens .

"input:  Person1:       Sir , I am very glad to tell that we have successfully registered the trademark for our new product . It is the time to think of some effective promoting strategies . We are beginning to get more attention from overseas .  
 Person2:Well done , Fred . Do you know something useful for our promotion for our I-series ?  
 Person1:        OK , Let me see . I suppose we must strengthen our promotion , because our brand is still new to some consumers . Maybe we should start our advertising program with our local and overseas distributors simultaneously , because they stand on a better position for selecting the best ways to advertise in market places . Besides , the advertisement fund can encourage them to spend more attention on advertising our products .  
 Person2:That is a good idea to start with . I also think the mass media is also a good approach for advertising .  
 Person1:        Yes , the mass media has wider influence . One of my classmates works in an advertisement company . I can get help and inspiration from him . And we can also try some less expensive approaches of advertising , such as on-line sales . Personally , I prefer to the on-line sales , for it is cheaper , faster and wider .

"input:  Person1:       How do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ?  
 Person2:I think that the public transport system could be made simpler . I never know where the bus routes actually go . The routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line .  
 Person1:        I think we just need to build more roads . Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams .  
 Person2:If we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . I think we should discourage people from using their cars .  
 Person1:        How would you do that ?  
 Person2:I think we should do a few things at once . Improving public transport would encourage people to use that . If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much .  
 Person1:        I don ’ t know . I think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money . They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax , for example .  
 Person2:I think that they should pay more tax . Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes .  
 Person1:        The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . It well be unpopular .

 Person1:        Yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings .  
 Person2:I understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . If so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala .

 Person2:Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed .

 Person1:        No , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because I ’ d like to see it in action .  
 Person2:So would I . what other unusual plants did they show ?  
 Person1:        They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . Other insects cannot get it . Of course , when the insect collects the nectar , it also takes some pollen from one flower to another .  
 Person2:That ’ s very specialized . So , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . If one became extinct , the other would too .  
 Person1:        That ’ s right . That ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species .  
 Person2:I see . The plants that fascinate me most are cacti . I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions .  
 Person1:        According to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation .  
 Person2:That ’ s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves , to reduce water loss .

 Person2:Yes , of course . Didn't you know that ?

 Person1:        Why would the government want to tax liquor so much ?  
 Person2:Liquor is considered a luxury item.And also , it is considered as something that isn't very healthy.So if people want to buy it , the government thinks it has the right to tax it .

 Person1:        At least you have obtained a very basic understanding of the game , haven't you ? I think it is perfect for boosting intelligence , cultivating personality and flexible learning . Every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into Chinese culture should learn to play Go .  
 Person2:I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it ?  
 Person1:        Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness .  
 Person2:I know it is quite different from Western chess .  
 Person1:        Yes . Playing chess is a very aggressive experience . All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . Whenever I start a chess game , I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill .  
 Person2:But isn't it the same with wiki ?  
 Person1:        Certainly not . The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent . In other words , each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board . Hence , chess aims to kill , while weigh is most concerned with howso survive .

"input:  Person1:       What's your ideal boss ?  
 Person2:I have had an incredible boss , who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience . A-bout two months after I began working for her , she really let me spread my wings . She encouraged me to work independently , because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment . So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day . Of course , I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports , although she didn't specifically ask me to . Without her support and encouragement , I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time . But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs . And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described , I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone .

For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off .

 Person1:        When viewing the Earth from space , do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ?  
 Person2:Detached . You're literally detached from one planet , captured by another . Your only link to reality is the Earth out there ; fortunate - 1y , it stays in view the whole time .  
 Person1:        There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality . Is it going to be some future project that never happens ?  
 Person2:I believe it's certainly for real . It without question has suffered a lot of delays . But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December . It is a reality . It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground .  
 Person1:        There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission . It seemed to fizzle out . Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner ?  
 Person2:I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair , that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on . But only time will tell .  
 Person1:        You had gone to the moon twice , orbited space around the Earth lots of times , and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have . How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness ? I just can't wait .  
 Person2:If I were the man making the decisions , you could get in line tomorrow . I strongly support ordinary people going into space . Unfortunately , I don't think it will be in the near future .

 Person2:We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments .  
 Person1:        I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house .  
 Person2:We need to find a good realtor .  
 Person1:        Not necessary . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .  
 Person2:What do you mean ?  
 Person1:        Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .  
 Person2:But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .  
 Person1:        Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .  
 Person2:I still think we should have a realtor . We're new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has any problems .  
 Person1:        Of course we need a house inspector . But we can hire an inspector on our own . As for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .  
 Person2:So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?  
 Person1:        It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .  
 Person2:And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?  
 Person1:        Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .  
 Person2:Why ?  
 Person1:        That is because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .  
 Person2:Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .  
 Person1:        It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That's why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .

"input:  Person1:       Since China was open to the outside world , its trade forms have become much more flexible . One of these commonly used forms is co-production . Would you please do a bit explanation of it , Mr . Walker ?  
 Person2:Well , under this arrangement two parties cooperate to manufacture a product or a category of products , for example , machine tools for export . Each party produces and supplies a part of the components and parts ; one party is a Chinese enterprise , the other , an overseas firm . Most probably , the foreign counterpart contributes technology and equipment , and sometimes , parts and components , while the Chinese enterprises factory building , labor and other resources to the cooperative production . They join hands and fulfill orders together by an agreement or a contract .  
 Person1:        I suppose that the assembling of these components and parts , particularly the marketing of the finished products should take place in China .  
 Person2:Not necessarily . It depends on the contract stipulations . They may be marketed in the foreign country where the other party is located , or even in a third country .  
 Person1:        I think the principle of co-production is to expand export trade . It's a reciprocal business , isn't it ?  
 Person2:Yes , you are right . Either party is not well-equipped to produce the final products single-handedly , but they can enter into an agreement . In such case , each side contributes different resources to make the manufacture of a certain product or a category of products possible .

"input:  Person1:       Are the ceremony and reception held in the same place ?  
 Person2:No , not usually . Most people are married in a church , and then the wedding party and guests go to another place for the reception . Sometimes , however , they hold the reception in a big room in the church .  
 Person1:        Where do they go ?

 Person1:        They go to the home of the bride ?

 Person2:Oh ! In our country the bride's family is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement , costs , etc . So the reception is held at her home .  
 Person1:        That's very expensive for the family of the bride .  
 Person2:Many American furthers joke that they would rather hold the ladder for their daughter to climb down and elope than pay for a wedding .  
 Person1:        Tell me something about the bridal bouquet . Isn't it the custom to throw it ?  
 Person2:Yes . When the bride and groom are ready to leave on their honeymoon all the single girls gather in one place . The bride stands with her back to them and throws her bouquet over her shoulder and they each try to catch it . The one who does will be the next one married .  
 Person1:        Maybe I'll be the one .

 Person2:What ? Why do we have to do that ?  
 Person1:        Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .

"input:  Person1:       For our lunch meeting with the investors , do we have to make a reservation at the restaurant or do we just show up ?  
 Person2:Usually for lunch , we don't have to reserve a table , they should allow walk-ins . But to be on the safe side , I'll order a table for half-past twelve . Will that suit your schedule ?  
 Person1:        I've arranged to meet them at the restaurant at twelve . Can you make the reservation a little earlier ? If we start earlier , it will give us more time for a longer lunch .

 Person1:        Yes , we'll start with appetizers , follow with a soup and salad course , then main dishes of prime rib or cordon bleu chicken , and finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort .

 Person2:Yes , uh ... I put it in the front of my sociology notebook . Oh , here it is .  
 Person1:        Let me see . Oh yes . Your professor has placed this book on reserve . That means you cannot find it on the shelves in its usual place . You need to go to a special room called the reserve room . It's down the hall and to the right .  
 Person2:I'm sorry - I still don't understand .  
 Person1:        You see , your professor wants every one in the class to read the chapter . If one student removes the book from the library , it is likely that none of the other students will have the opportunity to read it . So , your professor has insured that all students have the opportunity to read it by placing it on reserve .  
 Person2:So , will I be able to find this book ?  
 Person1:        Yes , when a book is on reserve , a student can go to the reserve room and ask the reserve librarian for the book . The student can have the book for a few hours , and he or she MUST read it in the library during that time . That way , the book stays in the library , and all students have a chance to read it .  
 Person2:Okay . Thank you . I understand now .

It's to celebrate those who work doing what other people might not be willing to do . I think we ought to do something in honor of the common worker .

 Person2:I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?

 Person2:So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .  
 Person1:        Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .

 Person2:That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .

 Person2:That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .

 Person2:A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face .

"input:  Person1:       Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today .

 Person1:        No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .  
 Person2:Www , man !  
 Person1:        In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .  
 Person2:Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?  
 Person1:        Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .

 Person1:        Well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies .  
 Person2:Oh , I see how this food can be really hard for you . I can sympathize with that . I stayed in Sichuan for a year . The food was difficult at the beginning . Every dish was so spicy . After a while though , I got used to the taste , and now I won't consider anything a real dish if it isn't spicy .  
 Person1:        Yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes .

"input:  Person1:       What do you think are the main causes of war today ?

 Person2:It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries .

 Person2:Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts.However , a few free kicks often make everything different , especially scoring one such goal in the nick of time .  
 Person1:        In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls .

 Person1:        What did it say about you then ?  
 Person2:For example , the message for the day before yesterday notified me that I , as a Leo guy , was to have some "" unusual experience in food and drink . And as it turned out , the reality matched this prediction well . Lasi night , I was treated to a dinner party by Mr . Lee .  
 Person1:        But it must have been only a coincidence . That's the only way superstition wins over science .  
 Person2:Oh , no . You can never tell whether such-and-such is science or sheer fraud.If horoscope is really something deceptive , how come quite a size of proportion of young people think highly of it .  
 Person1:        For fun . It serves as a shared topic to them.While they claim to consult the predictions constantly and marvel at their "" accuracy ' . they do not necessarily take them seriously . When it that these predictions are matched by their real-life experiences , they delight in spreading the thrill with friends . But if there isn't any correlation between reality and predictions , they just grin , forget about them , and go on living as usual .

"input:  Person1:       Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ?  
 Person2:I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ?  
 Person1:        I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays .  
 Person2:Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory .  
 Person1:        Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .  
 Person2:But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?  
 Person1:        Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .  
 Person2:I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ?  
 Person1:        That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .  
 Person2:Really ?  
 Person1:        Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .  
 Person2:Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?  
 Person1:        Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .  
 Person2:How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?  
 Person1:        That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .  
 Person2:So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?  
 Person1:        Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College .  
 Person2:Why did they want to found a college ?  
 Person1:        Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .  
 Person2:Oh , I see .  
 Person1:        Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name .  
 Person2:When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?  
 Person1:        In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman .  
 Person2:It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .  
 Person1:        Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard .  
 Person2:Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history .  
 Person1:        Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S .  
 Person2:I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .  
 Person1:        Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .  
 Person2:That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you .

 Person1:        True , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time .

 Person1:        Yeah , I have the same feeling . Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed . But at a wholesale market , you never know whether what you are buying are of good quality or not .

 Person2:Well , it's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it's ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so .  
 Person1:        My parents just didn't handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it's important that I should learn how to live on my own .  
 Person2:I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don't have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place .

 Person1:        Some people believe that a tough approach is better . Other prefer a more lenient approach .

This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg .  
 Person2:I don ’ t know about that ; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate .  
 Person1:        But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity . And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example , they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .  
 Person2:Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point .  
 Person1:        Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash .

 Person2:not really . When I was little , we didn't really listen to music at all .  
 Person1:        so , how did you become interested in it ?  
 Person2:well , when I was about 10 years old , I started playing the piano . I think that's how it all started .

 Person2:Well , they look lovely , but they ’ re not very practical . I mean , would you wear that dress to the office or walking down the street ?

 Person2:Maybe . I ’ m not sure why they have fashion shows like this . Hardly anyone will buy those clothes . The clothes you see are nothing like the ones that ordinary people wear . It seems like a waste of money .  
 Person1:        I think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons . First , it ’ s just like a big party . They can meet each other and network . The other thing is that it is great advertising . All the journalists and photographers are there . Thirdly , it give them a chance to show what they would like to see people wearing .  
 Person2:You meant it ’ s an expression of their fantasies ?  
 Person1:        Yes . I think the designers are saying that these clothes are what they would like to see people wear if those people weren ’ t concerned with what other people might think . In a way , the designers are saying ‘ don ’ t worry about what others think . Wear what you like ! ’ .  
 Person2:Very philosophical . I think they design these clothes more for publicity . They try to see who can be the most extreme and outrageous , but still stylish .  
 Person1:        Come on . All this fashion has reminded me that I want to buy some clothes .

"input:  Person1:       What do you think are the most important things to do when running a business ?  
 Person2:Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high .  
 Person1:        So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ?  
 Person2:No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs .  
 Person1:        How can a business maximise revenues ?  
 Person2:You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small .  
 Person1:        What else do you suggest ?  
 Person2:Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . They think that is must be poor quality if it ’ s that cheap .

 Person1:        Yes , I do . I find it very relaxing . I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work .  
 Person2:I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music .  
 Person1:        Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better .  
 Person2:Really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress .  
 Person1:        Yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework .  
 Person2:I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brian power .  
 Person1:        You can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them .  
 Person2:That ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier .  
 Person1:        That ’ s true . There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character .

 Person2:For sure ! I didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US .  
 Person1:        Like what ?  
 Person2:Well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K ?  
 Person1:        Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a 401K , you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg .  
 Person2:That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .  
 Person1:        That seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ?  
 Person2:Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .  
 Person1:        I ’ Ve been thinking of doing that lately ! I don ’ t want some banker to run off with my money !

 Person2:I passed college English Test Band - 4 , with good skill in listening , speaking , reading and writing .

"input:  Person1:       OK , Ann , you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that ?  
 Person2:I really liked living in Australia . I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney . And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney . There are lots of great clubs . And people were very , very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney .  
 Person1:        Mm-hm . How long were you there ?  
 Person2:I was there for almost a year .  
 Person1:        Oh , OK .  
 Person2:And I travelled a little bit in Australia . I went up the east coast . Up to Frasier Island . Which is a world heritage site . And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the ... , which is a but north . And the further north you go in Australia , the hotter it gets . So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license , so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly .  
 Person1:        So , did you , did you lose your finger ?  
 Person2:Almost .  
 Person1:        Almost . Ah , you're lucky . Um , it's funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams .  
 Person2:Exactly .  
 Person1:        Will you be going back to Australia soon ?  
 Person2:I'd like to go and live there for at least another year . Probably I'll go back to Sydney or maybe I'll go down to Melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city . They have lot of museums and parks .

 Person2:Nobody exercises any more-not even kids ! The average American home has the TV on for 6 hours a day !

"input:  Person1:       Good morning . I ’ d like to ask some questions about your insurance policies . 
 Person2:Of course . Please sit down . How can I help you ? 
 Person1:        I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content . 
 Person2:I see . Here ’ s a pamphlet about our home insurance policy . We ’ Ve named our policy ” umbrella ” . May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live ? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are . 
 Person1:        I understand . I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home . 
 Person2:Let me just check that on my computer . Oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . The other thing to take into account is deductibles . 
 Person1:        In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ? 
 Person2:It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit . 
 Person1:        Oh , I see . That ’ s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ? 
 Person2:If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less . 
 Person1:        It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding . I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree . 
 Person2:We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders . These are renewable after the first year . 
 Person1:        If I have a claim , how long does it take to make a settlement ? I ’ Ve heard that with some insurance companies , it can take months . 
 Person2:That is of great concern to out clients . We aim to satisfy all claims within a month , but we can ’ t guarantee that

 Person2:I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . If most people have similar amounts of money , they will not think of stealing from others .

 Person1:        It seems that English already is the main global language . Does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like Esperanto as the world language . 
 Person2:Actually , it suggest English . The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china , India , mexico , Nigeria , Pakistan , and japan . So beginning again with a language like Esperanto would be wasteful . The second argument is that English is used in modern technology far more that any other language . Most emails are sent in English and the vast majority of website use English . 
 Person1:        Does the article say anything about other language ? How will they survive in an English-speaking world ? 
 Person2:The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost , but others will continue to be used for generation , even if English continues to be the dominant language . 
 Person1:        Right . All the people who speak Chinese . Hindi , French and Spanish aren ’ t suddenly going to stop using those languages .

"input:  Person1:       Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ? 
 Person2:Cinct de mayo ? 
 Person1:        No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day . 
 Person2:Do we get a day off from school then ? 
 Person1:        No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is . 
 Person2:Www , man ! 
 Person1:        In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect . 
 Person2:Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ? 
 Person1:        Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality . 
 Person2:And then what happened ?

 Person1:        All of the Chinese are proud of the Great Wall . And it was built before the In dynasty near Shan Haiguan-the First Pass in the World .

 Person2:Maybe when they become teenagers , they want to be completely different to their parents . 
 Person1:        You might be right . I guess most parents want their kids to be like them , but kids today grow up in a different environment . You know , they know much more about the world from the internet , newspapers , and tv . 
 Person2:Do you think that teenagers get a lot of their bad behaviour from tv and movies ? 
 Person1:        Maybe some of it . I think a lot of people blame TV and movies when the real problem is that the parents aren ’ t bringing their child up correctly . 
 Person2:Parents have a difficult job . They have to bring up their children and usually have to work too . 
 Person1:        Yes , that ’ s true . Your son is doing well at school , isn ’ t he ?

"input:  Person1:       Welcome back movie lovers to another Premier Movie Review . My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite DavidWatson . 
 Person2:Thank you Dick . Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King . Tell me Dave , what is your impression of this film ? 
 Person1:        Well , I think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ’ s a very fine film . Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting . 
 Person2:I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable . 
 Person1:        Predictable ! How ! Come on Dick , It ’ s a G-rated movie ! It ’ s for the kids ! It ’ s not a thriller ! 
 Person2:Well , that ’ s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ’ s just too cliche . 
 Person1:        How can it be cliche ? It ’ s a fable ! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story ! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love . 
 Person2:You have always been so soft , Dave ! 
 Person1:        Open your heart Dick . Don ’ t shut us out . 
 Person2:Anyway ... That ’ s all for today folks ! Join us next time as we talk about & quot , How to lose a guy in 10 days & quot , I ’ m sure you ’ ll love that one Dave !

 Person2:Take it easy . It is all over now . How was it going , anyway ? 
 Person1:        I don ’ t know . I think I did well in the paper exams . I was prepared to answer a lot of questions , but they didn ’ t ask those as I expected . To my surprise , the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me . 
 Person2:That ’ s strange . But probably , it is the new interview technique they call it “ Getting to know you more personally ” . What about your answers ?

 Person2:I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . It may offer you many benefits . First , it's good for your health . I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate . While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . You might as well sleep out for a longer hour .

Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great !

"input:  Person1:       It's amazing to me how international business has become . Take my store for example . On any given day , you will find imported items from more than 20 different countries on our shelves . 
 Person2:How many different varieties of products do you import from China ? 
 Person1:        China provides the bulk of our product inventory , for sure . We import more than 40 different items from China . Most of the imports that come out of China are low-grade plastics or toys . Japan produces many electronic exports , Germany produces excellent mechanical exports . 
 Person2:Do you import any food items ? 
 Person1:        Generally speaking , food items are difficult to import . Food with the short shelf life is liable to spoil in the time it takes to ship from one place to another . The only food items we import are specialty canned or preserved foods . The shelf life is longer for these products .

 Person2:I guess so . I usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . How about you ?

 Person2:Do you have a brand preference for anything ?

 Person2:Yes , I watched United play Chelsea . What a fierce battle ! allay were engaged in intensive pressing and tackling in midfield . Well , it was not like a normal English League match . 
 Person1:        No , it wasn't . Rather , it looked like a Bundesliga match , where physical contact is so frequent . English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes . It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly . As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly , they often knew only chasing hard after the ball , but forgot to steal it . 
 Person2:Haha . That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common , and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent . And the ball is often kept flying overhead , drawing beautiful curves in the sky . Such games are quite pleasing to the eye . 
 Person1:        Which team do you back then ? 
 Person2:I'm a firm United supporter . I like their playing style . The Reds always have several excellent wing-backs , Like Riggs , Peckham and Gary Neville . They often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking . 
 Person1:        But the Reds keep a weak midfield . I think Juventas of Italian Series A have always maintained a very formidable midfield . It is the main source of its strength .

 Person2:Really ? In New Berlin ? 
 Person1:        No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a tornado watch . That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . 
 Person2:I understand . They think a tornado might come . 
 Person1:        Yes . People should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.So it's called a watch . 
 Person2:And the second stage is called a tornado warning . 
 Person1:        Yes . If a tornado has been spotted , they announce a tornado warning.So if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere . 
 Person2:It's scary .

 Person2:But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ? 
 Person1:        Maybe . It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast . 
 Person2:Have you seen a lot of them ? 
 Person1:        I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone . 
 Person2:Did it hit their house ? 
 Person1:        No , it didn't . But they are glad I called them . 
 Person2:What were they doing when you called ? 
 Person1:        They were all sitting in the living room watching TV.They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house.If it had hit them , they could have all been killed .

 Person2:Then could the soil on Mars somehow be fertile enough to Groh simple plants ? 
 Person1:        The soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything . And it would need to be protected from the UV radiation . 
 Person2:Actually , we are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on Mars for an extended period of time . Does NASA have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet ? 
 Person1:        I'm not sure NASA has built any portable habitats for extended stays on Mars , but they have looked at various designs .

 Person1:        Well , I'm not really an expert in this area , but my understanding is that anything is possible . It's just that it is so hard to determine what went on 4.5 billion years ago . 
 Person2:But maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of Mars so it may be inhabitable by humans . 
 Person1:        I'm skeptical . Mars is made of rocks containing silicon , iron , and various minerals . It also has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide . It is so different from what we have on earth , you know .

 Person2:Well , I prefer active rather than passive training . For example , I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin . They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice . All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room , so we could communicate with each other . We had a lot of fun learning together . It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues . 
 Person1:        Well , that is also very efficient , right ? 
 Person2:Of course , it is much better than just giving us some reading materials or information via the internet .

"input:  Person1:       What ’ s the difference between football and rugby ? 
 Person2:Those tow games are quite different . First , there ’ s the size of the teams . In football , a team has 11 players . In rugby there are 15 players on each team . The biggest difference is that in football , only the goalkeeper can use his hands . In rugby , the ball is usually carried forward by players , though kicking is permitted . 
 Person1:        In rugby , players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates , don ’ t they ? 
 Person2:That ’ s right . However , players can only pass the ball backwards . They cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates . That ’ s a foul . 
 Person1:        I know how goals are scored in football , but how about in rugby ? 
 Person2:If a team carries the ball over the goal line , they score points . A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch . 
 Person1:        There ’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby , isn ’ t there ? 
 Person2:Yes . Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball . This is called ” tackling ” , as in football . 
 Person1:        The ball is a different shape in rugby , isn ’ t it ? 
 Person2:Yes . It ’ s not perfectly round like a football . A rugby ball is oval in shape . There ’ s a match on TV this afternoon . Why don ’ t you watch it with me ? I ’ ll try to explain the rules and tactics while we ’ re watching .

 Person2:Go right ahead . 
 Person1:        Well , I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . Also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room 
 Person2:Well , you really do have a talent for this , Alice . Thanks for the suggestions .

"input:  Person1:       What's wrong ? 
 Person2:I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode . 
 Person1:        You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her . 
 Person2:The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me . 
 Person1:        They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's "" chi "" . 
 Person2:But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ? 
 Person1:        The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . 
 Person2:Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up . 
 Person1:        This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable . 
 Person2:Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more . 
 Person1:        This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it . 
 Person2:Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap .

 Person2:That's good . Not Evey company provides employees with training opportunity . It seems that your company wants to further develop their employees and encouragelifelong learning . 
 Person1:        Good ? ! For them but not to me . 
 Person2:So , what's the problem ? 
 Person1:        We have to participate in training after a busy day and during the weekend . You know , after work all you want to do is throw yourself onto your bed . And during the Weekend , you just want to stay at home and enjoy a family dinner . 
 Person2:Yes , you are right . But one should keep learning daily to maintain our keen mental power expand our intellectual capacity . Constant learning drive us to Sharp our power of reasoning , analysis and judgement . 
 Person1:        Yes , I agree with you on the point but couldn't the training be held during the working day instead of weekend ? 
 Person2:Yes , you are right . I think weekend is the time for family gathering and rest Maybe you could make that suggestion to your boss .

 Person2:Western and horror are the two types of movies I don't care for . 
 Person1:        Why don't you like horror ? They're entertaining . 
 Person2:Some are entertaining , but I find most of them stupid and childish . For example , I don't understand why a person always goes into the house alone when something is suspicious .

 Person1:        Yes . I use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . It can be frustrating when the connection is poor . 
 Person2:So , you ’ re online eight hours a day .

 Person1:        I think it ’ s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . First , a lot of the information you find online is false . Second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it . 
 Person2:How do you solve the website problems when you ’ re buying something online ? 
 Person1:        What I do is find the website of shops . Then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they ’ re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .
