 Person2:Yes . I would like some information for requesting a loan .  
 Person1:        Very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .  
 Person2:I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ?  
 Person1:        It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment !  
 Person2:It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score .  
 Person1:        That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .  
 Person2:You know what ? I don ’ t really need the money . Thanks anyways !

"input:  Person1:       The art critic from the daily chronicle doesn ’ t think much of the max oreo exhibition . He says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned . 
 Person2:Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . What did you think of it ? 
 Person1:        I liked it . I didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion . 
 Person2:I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic . He doesn ’ t seem to like anything . Which kinds of paintings do you prefer ? 
 Person1:        I like landscapes and still life . You prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ? 
 Person2:Yes , I do . I like painters who use rather than watercolors . The colors appear richer . What do you think ? 
 Person1:        I agree . I prefer oils too . I collect landscapes , but I only have a small collection . You have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ? 
 Person2:Yes . Good artwork is very expensive nowadays . When I was in china , I bought some calligraphy by famous artists . You should come and see it sometime . 
 Person1:        That would be nice . Can you read the characters ? 
 Person2:I know what the characters on the paintings mean . I think Chinese characters look very artistic . It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character . 
 Person1:        I think that ’ s true with any of the fine arts .

"input:  Person1:       What kinds of Tv programs do you enjoy watching ? 
 Person2:I like current affairs programs and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ? 
 Person1:        I like those kinds of programs too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of Tv . 
 Person2:I agree . People often criticize Tv for showing too much sex and violence . 
 Person1:        Yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational ! 
 Person2:Right . You can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs . 
 Person1:        In my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . I think it ’ s about six minutes per hour . 
 Person2:That ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the Tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? 
 Person1:        No . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on Tv in your country ? 
 Person2:Not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable Tv , where you pay a fixed amount each month . 
 Person1:        Some people have satellite and cable Tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their Tv programs . Besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programs . 
 Person2:Well , there ’ s a wildlife documentary on Tv in a few minutes . Shall we ?

"input:  Person1:       Thanks for offering to give me a lift . I'm looking forward to this party , but I didn't want to go alone .  
 Person2:Don't mention it . It's my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ?  
 Person1:        No , this is my first . Last week I went to a cookout 5 for new professors at Dean Barksdale's home . I took a taxi because I didn't want to be late . But I was the first one there .  
 Person2:I'll bet you were a little embarrassed .  
 Person1:        You're right . The invitation said two to seven . I was there at two o'clock , but most people didn't arrive until three or four . They didn't start cooking until five o ’ clock .  
 Person2:Cookouts often start slowly . A two o'clock start means you arrive any time after two .  
 Person1:        Thanks for telling me this .  
 Person2:I was late getting back from the mall , but I'm hurrying .
