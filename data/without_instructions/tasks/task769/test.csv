"input: At liquid -- air interfaces , surface tension results from the greater attraction of liquid molecules to each other ( due to cohesion ) than to the molecules in the air ( due to adhesion ) . The net effect is an inward force at its surface that causes the liquid to behave as if its surface were covered with a stretched elastic membrane . Thus , the surface becomes under tension from the imbalanced forces , which is probably where the term `` surface tension '' came from . Because of the relatively high attraction of water molecules for each other through a web of hydrogen bonds , water has a higher surface tension ( 72.8 millinewtons per meter at 20 ° C ) compared to that of most other liquids . Surface tension is an important factor in the phenomenon of capillarity .

"input: Field goal percentage in basketball is the ratio of field goals made to field goals attempted . Its abbreviation is FG % . Although three - point field goal percentage is often calculated separately , three - point field goals are included in the general field goal percentage . Instead of using scales of 0 to 100 % , the scale . 000 to 1.000 is commonly used . A higher field goal percentage denotes higher efficiency . In basketball , a FG % of . 500 ( 50 % ) or above is considered a good percentage , although this criterion does not apply equally to all positions . Guards usually have lower FG % than forwards and centers . Field goal percentage does not completely tell the skill of a player , but a low field goal percentage can indicate a poor offensive player or a player who takes many difficult shots . In the NBA , Center Shaquille O'Neal has a high career FG % ( around . 580 ) because he plays near the basket making many high percentage layups and slam dunks . Guard Allen Iverson often had a low FG % ( around . 420 ) because he took the bulk of his team 's shot attempts , even with high difficulty shots .
