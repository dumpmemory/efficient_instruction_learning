"input: In the exposition, the love theme remains shielded from the violence of the first theme. In the recapitulation, the first theme strongly influences the love theme and ultimately destroys it. By following this pattern, Tchaikovsky shifts the true musical conflict from the development section to the recapitulation, where it climaxes in dramatic catastrophe. Thanks to Balakirev as well as _his_ own hard work, Romeo would bring Tchaikovsky his first national and international acclaim and become a work the kuchka lauded unconditionally. <sep>, Pronoun: his
