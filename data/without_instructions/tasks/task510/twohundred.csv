"input: Text: this was about 10 years ago.

i worked as break relief in a bread factory. a ""wonderful"" bread factory, that at the time produced 3400-4000 loaves of bread per hour, and on a separate line 1800-3200 units of rolls (hamburg buns etc.) per hour. i was tasked with the job of relieving people for their breaks which were 20 minutes in length. 

there was this one job as a mixer operator. basically the job entails running a huge mixing machine, and the volume it could contain was measured in the thousands of gallons. typically, it would produce about 500 kg of dough every 15 minutes. visualize a 10 foot tall horseshoe-shaped bowl rotated vertically that is rotated down to empty and you get the idea.

so, to make dough, you have 4 basic ingredients: flour, water, yeast, and at this place, vegetable oil.

when i went to relieve the guy working this job, there has just been a change in the formula. to change the formula, you enter the new amounts of water, flour etc. on a keypad, and then press ""submit"" to save the changes.

what i hadn't noticed until it was too late was that the previous operator had forgotten to press ""submit"" on the amount of yeast for the new formula. so, what happened was i pressed the button to discharge flour, water, oil, and then yeast into the mixture, and then immediately noticed that the volume of yeast indicated on the panel was flashing, indicating that the previous operator did not press submit, and without intervention the machine will discharge only the amount that was in the previous formula. 

to correct this, for the first time ever, i pressed the big red stop button beside the control panel for yeast, inputted the correct amount less than the amount already discharged, and pressed the discharge button again. satisfied that i believe what i did was the right thing, i started the mix cycle, walked away and did something else.

15 minutes later, i'm relieving a different guy, but i have line of sight to the mixing machine. at the end of the cycle, the operator i relieved previously started to rotate the bowl, and not even after 10 degrees of rotation did a few dozen gallons of liquid yeast pour out. the mixing machine was completely full of yeast!

what had happened was, for some asinine reason, the ""stop"" button also reboots the plcs controlling the valve . i acted so quickly in inputting new numbers that the plc hadn't rebooted before i had hit the submit button. meaning, the valve was now stuck open. why they hadn't coded for that i'll never know.

in total, thousands of gallons of yeast were discharged into this mixing machine without anybody knowing for 15 minutes. as normally the amount used per run would be measured in the single digits of gallons, the facility only kept enough yeast to last about 3 days of normal production. this ""glitch"" ha actually depleted every last bit of yeast stored at the facility. they had to have a truck sent from a facility about 8 hours away to resupply, causing about 10 hours of downtime.

did i get fired? almost! they did try to scapegoat me saying i didn't follow proper procedure etc. but, the union came to my rescue and allowed me to keep my job. apparently this little bit of information was placed in the maintenance manuals, which are never provided to the operators for training.

"input: Text: actually a couple months ago. forgot about it until now. i was on my school trip to dc, it was my first time going there so i was pumped. we went to see all of the main touristy attractions (this is day one) then lastly we go on this big yacht. it is pretty popular but i do not remember the name off of the top of my head. at this point i haven't slept for maybe 48 hours, as i can't sleep in vehicles and it is about an 8 hour ride down. i was sitting with my friend and looking out into the river, on the back of the boat. i lean over the railing and look down. my glasses decide to slide off my face. *shit what do i do now?* i text my mom to tell her my new glasses just fell through the propeller of a huge boat and are now chilling in the potomac. this was only at the start of the ride and i couldn't see at all for the rest of the time. remember this is only day one out of two. i missed on seeing about half of the stuff, including arlington, the lincoln, korean, and vietnam memorials.

"input: Text: okay so giving the background to this story-
i'm a girl and my friends and i had been invited to come over to a house full of hot guys to chill. so naturally we go, and there's one hot guy i talk to the most, and we click and talk more and play beer pong. 
so we both get super drunk and we ended up in someone's bedroom where we proceeded to make out and take off each other's clothes. this next park might be tmi and you might get grossed out but it was literally the most embarrassed i've ever been with a guy.
so things escalate and he starts doing me, and then we switch positions and i start to give him a bj.
here's the bad part.
my stomach started to hurt from all the cheap burnettes mixed with cheap beer and after i gagged once there was no going back.
i threw up all over his junk. literally all over.
but here's the best part: he kept going.
he must've really wanted to fucking finish because we switched positions while there's vomit all over the bed and still on his dick.
needless to say i threw up again, and when he finally finished we kind of sobered up and realized there was fucking throw up all over us.
i apologized like a million times but he was a trooper and actually hugged me.
now we're friends on instagram. i'm still confused 

.

update: question to all guys out there: if this happened to you would you keep going, stop and be grossed out, stop but be understanding, or what? because for me in this situation i literally felt awful haha and i want to know if guys would think of this as a big deal??

"input: Text: i have a big problem with not being able to start something or do it for the first time. for example if i needed to go to the bank i'd procrastinate leaving and once i got to the bank sit in my car and contemplate if i need to go inside or not.well for the past few months this feeling has stopped me from getting my oil changed.

reddit, it's been 1 year and 6 months and i haven't changed my oil and now the fear of something being wrong with my car and extra fees i can't pay is keeping me from still getting it changed...

"input: Text: several years ago, before i was in my current relationship, i was that douchebag guy. i would have different women come and go. well one day i had two different women, let's call them **hannah** and **alice**, that wanted to come over and see me, one of which, **hannah**, i liked a lot. well normally i wouldn't have two girls over in the same day, to prevent any of the *seeing* and *meeting* each other, but i was full of myself. i told **alice** to come over early that morning so we could spend most of the morning together, but i had to go in to work early that afternoon.  i told **hannah** that i was working all morning but to come over later that afternoon and she could stay the night. 

well **alice** shows up around 7am, and of course, we screw around all morning. well **dumbass** me falls asleep, without setting an alarm. **alice** is asleep now too, thinking i'll wake her up when i have to go to work. well not *only* did **hannah** show up earlier than expected, she walks into my apartment without knocking, something she's does from time to time. i'm telling you, we really liked each other and had been talking for a while. *i just happened to like all the pussy too*. well what happens is this. i hear the truck, i *look* at the clock, and see it's a little passed noon. well **fuck fuck fuck**. i'm getting hot, nervous, my heart is sinking, i know i'm caught. maybe i can rush **alice** out the door before **hannah** can get put of her truck, *maybe* **hannah** will take her time coming inside. i wake **alice** up, say, ""*shit babe, i overslept, we've gotta go!* well **fuck me again**, she's butt ass naked and taking her *fucking* time getting her clothes on. **i am panicking**, and that's that. i'm freaking, and **alice** can tell. she thinks it is because i'm *late*, how cute. then i hear it, someone walking down the stairs outside my apartment. *my apartment was below the parking lot.* **hannah** walks in. a portal to hell opens, and shit goes crazy! if you want to know how to open a portal to hell, have two women you're fucking, meet. they both ask ""*who is this?*"" i'm not even speaking, my brain has shut down, i remember they are both screaming now, they'll start at me, and then they'll go  at each other. **hannah** starting to cry out of rage. this lasts for at least **10 minutes**, but to me it feels like forever. i want to lay down and die. **alice** finally just says *fuck you* to *me*  and starts to leave,  **hannah** says something along the lines of, ""*oh you didn't get enough?*"". i shit you not, **alice**, holding onto the front door, turns, looks at **hannah** and says, ""*no, i got plenty, i was just warming him up for you.*"", and leaves from my apartment and my life. **hannah**, still standing there in shock and tears, wants me to explain, wants some kind of explanation. well reddit, i'm fried, my brain has completely overloaded, i can't even speak. i'm just standing there like a fucking mental patient with the dumbest look on my face i'm sure. after what seems like forever, she finally just leaves.

**hannah** and i spoke a little after that from time to time. i still couldn't think of anything to say to make anything right. what was i suppose to say? i can't even think of anything smartass to say.  to this day, that was my biggest fuck up ever.

"input: Text: this actually happened about a year and a half ago. my best friend and i im each other almost every day (we don't live near each other). this has been going on for about 10 years at the time, so, yanno, we're comfortable with each other. we make lots of really bad, off color jokes, all the time. he's also gotten me really good on multiple april fool's, so, yanno, sometimes i take what he says with a big grain of salt.

now, all i know at this point is that my friend, let's call him tim, is super clumsy. that's cool, i'm pretty clumsy myself, but he just seems to have a knack for getting into awful situations and mildly hurting himself. so i lovingly refer to his mishaps as ""timming"", and we kek mightily over this for years. it becomes one of our biggest inside jokes, to refer to accident prone people as ""tims"", or the act of being in one of these accidents as ""timming"". (i'd like to stress here that we'd never make fun of people in serious accidents. we're talking about small cuts, bruises, scrapes, that kind of thing.)

anyway, on this fateful day, he winds up tripping and falling and mildly hurting himself as he usually does. i worry over him of course, because i'm a good friend dammit, and whip out with ""why do you tim yourself so much?!"" i've asked similar things over the years and expect a good-natured ""i dunno"" or the usual off hand joke, but instead he tells me, ""because i have cerebral palsy.""

again, this dude and i, we've been chatting with each other for 10 years. i've stayed with him and his family and had a rockin' good time. we make horrible jokes all the time. this isn't even the most horrible of all of them, so i cackle and tell him that isn't a nice thing to say. ""muffinbutton, i'm serious."" ""lol kay."" (to be fair and to make me look like less of the asshole i'm quickly shaping up to sound like, he put a smiley face at the end of his sentence. how was i supposed to know he was being serious when he uses emoticons?!)

""muffinbutton, i have a mild case of cerebral palsy. there were complications when i was born. i had years of therapy to learn to walk right. i'm very lucky, but i still walk with a limp and don't have the best motor skills. that's why i fall over a lot and hurt myself.""

oops! i'll just be over here at the shovel store, buying a bigger shovel so i can dig the hole i've dug myself just a bit deeper!

the incident didn't change our relationship at all, and he admitted that me coming up with the whole ""timming"" thing made him feel a lot better about things but wow i felt like an asshole that day. i'm just happy to have such a good friend that didn't immediately block my stupid ass and has a great sense of humor.

"input: Text: ah, there's a first for everything, including smoking. here's how my first smoke went:

it was a cold november evening at a house party and i was very drunk. i see a girl smoking outside and start a drunken conversation with her. we got onto the topic of smoking and she offers me a puff of her cigarette. me being inexperienced at that sort of thing politely took the cigarette and pretended to inhale. drunk people aren't great at being subtle and she saw right through my act and lightly teased me for it. 

so, i decided to take in the biggest puff my lungs could hold. i had vaped clouds before, how different could it be?

the answer was, very fucking different. the shock of all that smoke going down into my virgin alveoli immediately produced a reaction in the form of violent coughing and me dropping the cigarette inside the wooden decking of the garden, losing the cigarette. ah fuck, i had made a complete jackass of myself in front of this girl *and* lost her cigarette. oh well, time to go to back into the house.

5 minutes later i walk back outside and nearly shat myself. the cigarette i had dropped had turned from a tiny clump of embers into a plume of smoke and flame coming out between the holes of my friend's decking. shit. fuck. within a few minutes the whole deck would be on fire then my friend's house would be ground-zero within hours.

thank god for garden hoses and sober friends i guess, the next few minutes was a blur of water jugs and hosesprays all around the garden

every friday at our school we don't have classes and instead of classes we have year long projects. my friends and i decided to do some studies by using blue crabs and testing them in different environments. so today my friend walked in with a white 5 gallon bucket of baby blue crabs, there were probably 4 or 5 in the bucket. i was in charge of watching the crabs and staying with the bucket. this is all happening at lunch time and as the clock winds down i haven't gone to get my lunch yet. i am pretty hungry and had an extremely small breakfast. so i decide to place the bucket in the corner of the room and go and get lunch. 

i had a great lunch. the pizza that i had was fantastic so a+ lunch. as i return the 5 gallon bucket is gone from where i put it. i immediately go into panic mode and start running all over the school to find it. with the bucket no where to be found i rush to the front office and ask if they have seen it anywhere? they say they haven't. we then as a team of group and front office staff run around the school to find the crabs. again no luck. we then used the intercom which has only been used 2 other times in the existence of the school. once for a flood and once for a medical emergency. ""a group has lost a  gallon bucket of crabs if anyone has taken it or sees it pleas bring it to the front office.

"input: Text: all right, so this just happened to me and i am so embarrassed. today's my birthday and my girlfriend and i were supposed to go out, but she had to pick up an extra shift at work, so we both decided to celebrate my birthday tomorrow. it was a boring night and i had nothing to do but stream netflix, so what's the next best thing? i decided to watch some porn to pass by time before i sleep. my roommate is gone for the weekend, so i was able to masturbate freely. as i was getting into it, i hear the front door open. i heard the voice of my roommate echoing through the walls. i was sure he heard my sexual moans. instead of stopping, i decided to continue masturbating making all these sounds. my girlfriend and i have sex all the time in my room, but my roommate doesn't seem to care too much, so i decided to let my roommate believe i was with my girlfriend. it's better than masturbating, right? all of a sudden, i heard a door slam. i dismissed it and continued to masturbate. 10 minutes later, i received a text from my girlfriend.
                                  
**girlfriend:** it's over

**me:** what?

**girlfriend:** i can't believe you...i was going to surprise you. i never want to see you again.

 5 minutes later, my roommate texted me...

**roommate:** that's messed up, man.

**me:** what did i do?

**roommate:** you had another girl in your room.

that's when i realized that my roommate and girlfriend thought that i was with another girl in my room. she's not responding to my texts.

 

**update:** wow, today is just not my day. it's also friday the 13th. i got a text back from her telling me that it was okay that i cheated on her because she also had a moment of weakness a month ago when she cheated on it. i don't know how to take this right now.

**update #2:** she cheated on me with my roommate. supposedly they were heading back to my place together to fuck. i told my roommate that i would be out with another friend celebrating my birthday for the night, so it looks like my roommate and girlfriend took the opportunity to fuck while i was gone. little did they know that i decided to stay home.

the reason it hurt my dad's feelings is because when i was a baby my mother left my dad one day while he was at work. she wrote a letter that explained how she was unhappy in their marriage and that she was taking my sister and i with her and moving ""home.""  my mother's home is the tiny island in the south pacific called guam.  my dad lived in colorado.  i did not meet my father until i was around 11 years old.  it wasn't my father's fault he wasn't there when i was growing up.

  fueled by the rage of the day, and the thought of not smelling like a black ice, i give it one last vicious shake (those real snappy shakes to get your money's worth) while letting out an affirmitive, ""oh, you fucking cunt!""
  i made sure to time the ""cunt!"" perfectly with the apex of my final, most ferocious shake to make sure all my rage was focused on getting those last drops of goo. 
   well, instead, i lost my grip of the oddly shaped bottle and flung it, full speed, directly into one of my testicles. i also then dropped the scrubby thingy, losing what remaining goo i managed to scavenge in the first place.
   i took a few seconds to gather myself. i then began to lather myself with shampoo. i was out of options.

now here the fuck up. 
under the chairs, they placed cards(you know like the one's to win a prize), so me unknowingly sat on one of those chairs. 

the card had a symbol that was unknown until later on. my mind was telling me to give it to a girl from my class but my mind said no.

later on, they said those with that card had to dance. my mind was fucked up. my heart started beating. so i walked up and had to chose a dance to dance to. i drawed it and it was...... watch me whip(or whatever the hell that dance is called).

so when it was my turn, i was one if the few people who didn't know how to dance to it. i was forced to do it as i couldn't drop out. while this was going in, the back of my neck was paining like *insert vulgar word here"" hell.

afterwards, the embarrassment screwed me over. i felt like crap. my mind was uneasy. after all this bs, they then said it was able to view on the school's website.

last night i got shitfaced.  i bowl on thursdays, and my buddies and i usually enjoy a few beers, but i guess i felt like letting loose a little bit, and we were also getting some free drinks and shots from the wait staff. also, i had a designated driver, so everything fell into place to have a blast. 
i was shitfaced at that level where you can't really see anything, and what you can see looks like the milenium falcon jumping into hyperdrive, while also spinning in a circle. good times. 

i got home and stumbled into bed. the world was spinning, i was doing everything i could to avoid having to throw up. i know some people would rather puke and feel better, but i just have an aversion to it and avoid it at all costs. plus i didn't want to wake my wife up. 

fast forward to today. i of course woke up with a pretty nasty headache and some residual nausea, but i'm a grown up so a dragged myself out of bed and got to work on time. i was playing it safe. had a few bites of toast. alternated sipping water and gatorade, just trying to get things back to normal. i thought i had it under control.  

at 9 i had a meeting with my boss and a couple of other fellows, discussing a pretty exciting opportunity that's coming my way which includes a promotion and a pretty significant raise. my boss was sitting at the head of a rounded off conference table. i was sitting next to him on one side, so we were in fairly close proximity.  at some point, it started to hit me that i was not ok, and the hangover was making a strong comeback. i felt sick.  i tried to power through and pay attention, and i just kept hoping this meeting would be over soon, because i was pretty sure i was going to have to hurl this poison out of me.  finally, my boss asked me a direct question.  i turned to face him, and i opened my mouth to answer....and out of me erupted a wet death with the force of a fire hose. it was exactly like something out of a movie. it looked fake as it happened, when i see it in my memories, it still looks fake. i absolutely destroyed the man who is in direct control of my financial future.

"input: Text: i posted this 2 days ago but i didn't know about the no poop stories on weekdays thing. so here it goes again:

after a party today i was heading off home and just missed my train. no worries i'll just go to kfc to pass time.
i go up and order my zinger burger meal then sit down and start eating it. i'm looking at my phone and eating at the same time, once i finished i discover some bastard has left his twister, wrapped and all.


i give it a poke. hmm seems fine, just cold. seems like it was from around an hour ago. being the frugal, greedy fat cunt i am, i wait until the person next to me leaves and i go ahead and eat the twister. all i can say is, it was delicious at the time.


now i'm at the train station. that's when the immense stomach aches begin. but you know what i'm a tough guy and ain't letting no pussy ass aches stop me. the train comes and i get onto the train with no problems and the ache goes away.


then... 4 stops before home. my phone is about is dead and i'm reading the local newspaper which i found on the train.
boom. my ache is back. fuckkkk its so bad this time. my ass hole begins to let air out once every second to ease the ache.
3 stops from home.


gg there's no more air left in my bowels and i can feel poop edging out of my butt. the uneasiness is fucking unreal. i grab a few pages of the newspaper and shape it quickly into a nappy and stuff it in my underpants..


im pacing down the hallways now to stop my sphincter from failing me. the people on the other carriages can see me with my but clenched walking up and down the aisle.
1 stop from home.


holy fuck. you know how the closer you get to the toilet the looser your anus becomes. fuck me at this point i feel like a 60 year old slut who loves it up in hole #2. there has got to be a bit of poop in my hand made newspaper nappy.


this has got to be the greatest mental and physical challenge of my life. my whole body and mind is failing me at this point. but you know what i can do this,!!!


i clench my sphincter like i'm doing my last rep in my last set. it's the finale boys. you will be free soon mr brown.
the doors open to my train stop and bolt to the toilet. and fuck me am i a dumb cunt. it's fucking 2am of course the toilets locked.


but my anal muscles cannot handle the weight of my poop. i am this choice have no choice but to empty my bowels onto the grass right outside the station. it is the biggest shit i've ever taken and looks like 3kg of satay sauce from the local thai restaurant.
i cleaned my ass hole with the leftover newspaper and covered the poop with it and ran home where i'm currently recovering safely.


sorry to whoever is greeted by a giant pile of shit tomorrow morning at the station. i promise this will never happen again

** 

edit: i should mention i live in australia!!!

edit 2: just went back to the same station. can confirm the poop is still there, albeit dried up. looks like a circular piece of meatloaf now. it smells like total shit,  no one has cleaned it up and there are flies buzzing around.

"input: Text: so this tifu did not happen today, although i just found about this subreddit from my brother when i told him this story. this happened two days ago.  
   
   so i walked into work this morning, and i was about 15 minutes early, so i decided to chill in the break room for a few minutes. as i sit down at a table in the break room, i spot the vending machine. what are the odds! i have a five dollar bill in my pocket! but the vending machine wont accept a five dollar bill for a one dollar beverage. i decide to hurry to another break room in another section of the hangar. (i work at an airport.) i go to the other break room which has a money changing machine. i skip to the machine and insert my five dollar bill. now, i was expecting to get five ones or even a few quarters. i was not expecting what happened next. the machine beeped, and then started spewing nickels. nickels! fucking nickels!!!!! 5 dollars in nickels is 100 nickels! i stood there, frozen, in front of a crowded break room. it was completely quiet, (except all those fucking nickels rolling around), and everyone was staring at me. i kinda just stood there for a few seconds, thinking it was a joke. but it wasn't. i quickly got down and grabbed all the nickels, shoving them into my pockets. everyone began to laugh. i ran out of the room, leaving a trail of nickels.  i walked around work clinking and jingling for the rest of the day. but i decide i already sacrificed so much for this gatorade, i will get this damn thing. so i stood in front of the machine putting nickel after nickel in. it takes forever but i do it. as im leaving work, i have to go through security. i beep and the security guard asks me to hold out my arms. i try to tell the man i have some loose change, but he just goes ""ok sonny but ima going to need you to hold out your arms."" (i live in the southern u.s.) he waves his wand around, gets to my hips and the wand beeps. he asks me to empty my pockets.  i start pulling out handfuls of nickels. the security people dont believe this, but i tell them what happened and they all started laughing. they said i could go through. so yes. that happened. it was one of the most embrassing moments of my life.

"input: Text: not today but...

two weeks ago i went to a 3 day festival, a regional burning man event. fast forward to the day after the festy i went to a party at a friend's house and got extremely drunk. as soon as i came home, i passed out. 

i woke up a few hours later with the  very strong urge to take a piss. when i woke up, i woke up in a half-dream state and i thought i was still camping and i was in the tent. it was dark as fuck in my room. in my half-asleep and possibly still drunk haze, i then got out of bed, and started feeling around for the tent flaps. i eventually found the ""tent flaps"" but then tried to feel around for open space so i can find a nice spot to release my urine. couldn't find it, but i thought ""well, i'm outside of the tent, i'll just piss directly out of it."" and i started taking a leak. 

about 3 seconds into my stream, i then came to my senses. ""wait, i'm no longer at the festival. i'm at home... and in my closet"" and then stopped pissing and then found the restroom. my closet floor was pretty wet but i didn't fuck it up as bad as i thought.

it was embarrassing as fuck even though i'm the only one that knows about it, and now internet strangers do too.

"input: Text: first, a little context for the story.  i am a 22 year old male and i just finished working that [pennsylvania farm show](http://www.farmshow.state.pa.us/), with 14-hour-days on my feet, 9 days straight.  i won’t mention exactly what my job was because it would be obvious who i was irl, but it involved making food and picking up heavy things fairly regularly.  

now, on to the fuck up.  due to the strenuous nature of my job, i had developed a sore, knotty back, so i decided that a nice long soak in the tub would probably do wonders for me.  i hadn’t taken a bath in probably 8 years, i just prefer showers.  so i get all set up; the perfect temperature, epsom salts, bubble bath, a nice bowl of weed… the whole nine yards.  anyways, as i’m sitting there, i need to reach out of the tub to grab the shampoo.  at this point, i was pretty high.  i reach forward at kind of an odd angle, and suddenly feel water shoot up my ass, catching me totally by surprise.  after the initial shock wears off, i think, “huh, i can probably clean my butthole like that”.  did i mention that i was high?

so i start shifting back and forth and, at first, it is working/feeling kinda good.  i guess i must have moved too forcefully, because all of a sudden, i shit myself.  i am so caught off-guard that i drop my bowl right into the tub.  so now have shit on me, shit floating in the bathwater, and my weed is gone.
  
i open the drain, turn the shower on and rinse myself off.  once the tub is empty, i see there is still some left in the tub, so i now have to clean that shit up.

*originally i posted this on tuesday but those darn mods wouldn't let me. it's fine now.*

okay, so like i said i went into school today and at lunch went to the library. she wasn't there this time around, so i went to the cafeteria.

now, i had gotten strange looks and some laughs earlier in the day, so i knew she had spread the word with my mastery to masturbate. 

when i went into the cafeteria, i saw her with her friends, so i decided to sit alone at the table across from her. i had no lunch as usual, so i simply stared at her for, say, thirty seconds before realizing i was being cringy so i went up and sat as close to her as possible.

immediately, her friends either giggled or called me nasty and told me to sit away from them, so i acted. i read every single comment, and i chose was i thought would be the most flattering and best plan by combining a couple of suggestions.

in front of all her friends, i said something like this:

""gf, i'm sincerely sorry for disgusting you. however, i want you to know that the very reason i chose to jack off to you was because i cared about you.""

i obviously wasn't that eloquent, but she was blushing, so i thought i was doing well.

""over all the naked women on the internet, i chose your body to lust to. i had hoped you'd think it's flattering.""

i was wrong about how i was doing.

""don't talk to me anymore"", said gf.

i was desperate, so i used what i learned from nofap.

""gf, i haven't jacked off to you in nearly a month. please, i do not jack off anymore. not in 25 days."" she ignored me.

i left, in defeat and shame. 

we're officially broken up and i'm now known as the fapmaster around school.

*edit* i'm fapmaster flash now. a lot of things happened since tuesday. this isn't the right sub for the story, though.

"input: Text: background info: when i was around 5 years old, i had a rat named bob and he lived in one of those little glass aquarium/cages.  there is only one  bathroom that i could use back then (the other is attached to my parents room).  i also had no concept of how much small animals peed. 

one day my parents were having a party, and they said they weren't going to force me to mingle with their friends.  during the party i was hiding in my room when i realized i really had to pee, but i didn't want to make it known that i was home by going to the bathroom.  i ended up holding my pee for far too long and finally made a run for it, but there was someone in there.  whoever was in the bathroom must have been having some problems because they were there for a really long time.  meanwhile my bladder was about to burst, so i ran back into my room frantic, saw the glass aquarium and let loose.  bob immediately sought out shelter on top of his little house while his aquarium filled with over an inch of pee.  

after i peed in his cage i panicked, but then realized i had a perfect scapegoat... the rat.  i gathered up my courage, ran upstairs and told my mom that bob had an accident in his cage.  she was confused but came down to my room, along with a bunch of her friends.  as soon as everyone walked in and saw bob swimming around in an inch of pee i confidently said ""i think bob peed"".  everyone was able to come to the conclusion that that i was the one who peed in the aquarium and burst out laughing, i was absolutely mortified at the time.

"input: Text: i was walking home after work and, with it being friday, had planned to stop by the shop and grab myself a few drinks for the festivities later on. i waited in line at the cash machine to collect the rewards of my hard graft that week, or rather what was left of it after rent and bills had been stripped away. 

i don't know if it's common in other countries, but we would have some homeless people who would sit beside the cash machine and relentlessly beg ""change please"" at any one using the machine. i don't have a single coin on my being to buy their silence, and i'm lifting cash from the machine... i suspect it might be their game plan, but there is no way i'm passing on notes. so i stare blankly ahead, trying my best to put on my 'i've-had-a-tough-day' face on and faking deafness or letting on i'm zoned out, i'm never sure which. i get my money and go. i'm a bastard.

about 200 yards further along on my journey to home, i call into the garage. outside is a scruffy looking character squatting outside the window. the beggars don't usually come down these parts, but this one had the instrument that really tugs my heart strings. a dog. a dog, possibly some sort of terrier but i'm no dog expert, lying sprawled out in front of him. like the chaps lingering at the cash machine, i was aware of this guys plan (the dog) but this time, it was going to work. not only that, but this time i'd be coming out of the shop with change. i had the coins, he had the dog. i had also trailed a little bit of guilt with me from the previous beggar encounter. 

i purchased my goods, handed over my notes, and then, as predicted, my hand was filled with cumbersome change. but this time i had a plan. rid myself of guilt and loose change in a single arm movement. i don't know about other people, but i feel awkward passing change to homeless people. guilty when not doing it, awkward when doing it. am i giving enough? is this a tad condescending that i'm walking away with extravagant goods whilst dumping my change to this poor chap who has nothing but some clothes, a dog and a cup?

my plan was to walk out throw the change in the cup, maybe even recall my 'i've-had-a-tough-day' demeanor with a hint of '-but-hey-i'm-still-helping'. out the shop i go, avoiding eye contact, a slight bend of the knee to lower myself closer to the target and i drop 5-6 coins into the cup.

only there is an unexpected splash. it's not a begging cup, it's a cup of coffee. that i've probably just ruined. my face goes bright red (i can be an awkward guy). i freeze and am forced to make unwanted eye contact. 

after an eternity of 3 seconds, i cough (that's an acceptable apology right?) and hastily make my exit. i perhaps should have bought him a new coffee but i'm a cowardly bastard. i'm 95% sure he wasn't even homeless. but that my guilty mind had fashioned some scruffy bloke with his dog and a cup of coffee into the homeless person i could help.

  eventually the side of my driveway is filled with tire tracks and i take the long approach driving diagonally up the side.  this was my first mistake.  mistake number 2 was having the lull arm extended high into the air to keep the tree of the ground.  so i'm going up the side of the driveway and gravity decides to remind me, i can't do that and throws the lull onto it's side.  i don't know what i was thinking except here we go.  the lull starts flipping and i pull myself to the inside and hold on for dear life as i fall at the speed of a scene from 300.  the lull comes crashing down with glass shattering everywhere.
  i look up to see diesel spewing from the fuel tank overtop of me.  now i've seen one or two action movies so i think to myself, oh shit this is where the lull blows up and i die and the thought process was if i shut it off it won't blow up.  (i later learned that won't explode).  the front glass shattered in the crash so i was able to climb out.  i escaped unscavanged except a few cuts on my hands from the glass while crawling out.  sorry i'm not very good at telling stories or grammar, but i thought maybe one person would enjoy my tale.

"input: Text: so in the turkish republic foreigners residing in the country for an extended period of time are required to get a residence permit.  today was my appointment.  this occurs at the fatih police station.

a lot of people have trouble finding finding the location within the complex where you turn in your papers.  in light of this, after i turn mine in i thought to myself, ""wouldn't it be useful to create a guide so other people could use it.""  why this guide should include some photos! 

so stupid me decides to act on this, at the time, brilliant idea and on my way out im merrily taking photos of landmarks to use.  since my appointment is late, (9pm) there is nobody around and i can take these photos unabated.  all is well until i get to the front and i take a photo of the building.  i get accosted by what i assume to be a non uniformed police officer and i tell him in turkish that i don't speak enough to understand him.  he takes me to a uniformed officer sporting an mp5 submachine gun and tells him the situation in turkish.  by now i realized i've made a mistake but i have no choice but to ride this rollercoaster until the end.

so since i realize my mistake and i already know what's coming next i hand the officer my device with the photos pulled up and i delete one making sure to show him the process.  he takes it and repeats the process for every photo while asking questions like, 

where are you from?
why are you taking photos?
why are you in turkey?
where do you study?
what do you study?

by this point i'm attracting a lot of attention from the other officers posted in front because there is literally nothing else happening other than cars driving by, it's really late like 9:45pm local time.  so every time another officer joins our new circle of friends i have to repeat my story.  by the end i'm encircled by 6 police officers armed with an assortment of automatic weapons including mp5 and m4 looking weapons that may have been hks since they already had mp5s.  

the last officer that joined our circle of friendship came up on my left and cut me off mid sentence and yelled,""dont panic, dont panic my friend.""  now, i dont feel like i was panicking, i could feel some adrenaline sure but even if i was panicking i feel like i was perfectly within my right to panic because i was encircled by police in a foreign country sporting automatic weapons after doing something very stupid.  

right before this the original english speaking officer asked if i took videos, i hadnt but he had to check anyway.  he watches a few of them, and scrolls through some like he had before with the pictures, at some point he was just admiring my collection, anyway he selects one more to play and this one happened to be me shooting a handgun at an indoor firing range.  so that didn't look good.

anyway, since the new guy joined i had to go through the gauntlet of questions again and this time at the end, kind of out of the blue, he asks if i know of [kevin mitnick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kevin_mitnick).  now, i did two internships at a defense contractor during high school after i performed well in a cyber security competition and at a time i trained to be a penetration tester.  so yeah, i know who kevin mitnick is we hit it off from there.  i had the fortune to take a cybersecurity centric tour of the pentagon before and i happen to have a cio.gov folder from that day that i used to carry all my residence permit shit.  it has a presidential seal on it and binary 1s and 0s aesthetically faded on the interior, they ooo'ed and aaahh'ed at it for a few moments and made polite conversation about hacking and firearms.  when i'm about to leave he says something about a photo and facebook, i didn't ask to clarify because i really wanted to get out of that situation since my fight or flight response was still active.  we exchange goodbyes in turkish after a few steps i say turn and say the equivalent of ""bye-bye"" in turkish and wave.  they respond the same as a group with a smile and i ran to cross the street.

i did not want to run out of gas, so i decided to fuel up and be a couple of minutes late. i still rushed as fast as i could to minimize the time it took to refuel.  i prepared the words i would use while i was fueling up and on my way to work. refueling cost me 7 minutes. this would put me getting to work about 10 minutes late. it is not unheard of for traffic to set someone back that far, so i was prepared to lie, using that as an excuse. now 7:48 i drive as fast as i was comfortable with to get to work. apparently, i drove a bit too fast; i got pulled over by the cops. i could probably write some interesting dialog that sounds like some kind of a joke, but let's just say i was embarrassed. the cop gave me a $140 ticket for speeding and a court date to assess the damage i did to the fuel pump. in my rush, i left the handle in my gas tank and when i took off, i snapped the connector. fortunately, the handle of the pump was designed with dummies like me in mind and it snapped right where it could easily be repaired. i showed up to work an hour late this morning. i hope they will give me leniency since i have a citation to prove it was the cop that slowed me down.

"input: Text: this happened over the summer, but it was the most embarrasing situation i've ever been in. i'm a sixteen year old guy, but i'm pretty tall for my age, about 6'3.

anyway, my brother and his buddies decide to head out for a party that night. i had a date with a girl i really liked (an hour after the party started) and mum was out of town taking care of grandma after her knee surgery. i really wanted to start things off right with this girl because she was literally perfect. cute, smart, funny, and a little geeky like me. i got myself a new shirt and cleaned up nicely. i was ready for this.

my brother didn't want to come back and pick me up, so he took me with him. now my brother isn't the smartest guy and two weeks ago he bought this old, junky car that probably couldn't last more than six months. we were finding problems with this piece of shit literally every three days.

so i get into the car and buckle up. immediately, i knew something was wrong. the clip took a lot more effort to put in and it snapped closed when i finally pushed it in. i thought, no big deal, it's just old. my brother and his friends get in and i get to go to the party place. it's the middle of summer vacation, so everybody's outside and in the pool. the car (piece of shit that it is) doesn't have working windows, so it's almost 110 degrees inside. my brother and his friends get out of this heat and i go to unbuckle myself. that's weird. the button's not going down. i push the buckle again, a lot harder than i need to. nothing. the damn thing stays locked! i think, okay, i'll just extend the belt and pull myself out. nope. the belt is locked in place.

i was stuck in that car for the next sixty minutes. my tall, lanky body sweated itself out, and then boiled itself in that little metal box. but the smell...oh god the smell. i am not a person who has a problem with bad b.o, but the stench of that car baked itself into my skin.

i finally see my brother coming back. i'm sitting in the back, and he's basically carrying this other guy with him. he said something about vodka, and this dude was about as drunk as you could get. my brother basically dumped him into the seat next to me and got in the driver's seat to take me to my date.

at this point, i'm not sure why i still wanted to go. i probably smelled like the entire boy's locker room distilled into one teenage boy. we get to the fountain (where i was going to meet this girl), and this drunk turns around and throws up in my lap. this foul-smelling green concoction of guacamole, vodka, and stomach acid. right onto my new shirt and clean jeans. i sat there, shocked.

my date was already there and she was looking for me. i decide to just text her and call off the date. two seconds after i send her the text, i see her coming towards the car, looking like she was ready to kill me. keep in mind, this car's windows don't work. she tells me to roll down the window. i try to signal to her that the windows don't work and to go away(i didn't want her to see me with the dude or the vomit) but she looks shocked and starts crying. i told my brother to just drive home. he was just sitting there, laughing his ass off. as i later found out, my date had a crush on me for quite a bit of time, and i basically told her to get lost on what would have been our first date.

"input: Text: hey, so, this happened yesterday but after it all i was too tired to do much but crawl into bed with food & netflix till i passed out so just be happy it happened this year, ok? awesome, shall we begin?

i'll start off by explaining i work in a museum as part of the education team which means i teach school groups most days. yesterday we had a school we weren't expecting show up (which doesn't happen often but still happens) but it was only one class so while another member of our team lead the group i spent most of the day getting on with preparing a presentation i have to give in a few weeks.

now we're a fairly laid back office on days like this & recently when i'm busy at home i generally have something playing on netflix in the background, so much so that i'm used to have background noise while i'm working on anything for a long period of time, so i spent most of yesterday working on my presentation with 'scrubs' on in the background. 

most days i work from 9-4 but on tuesdays i finish at 3 because i have to get from work to a brownie unit i've been helping with but that's currently on hold however i still planned to leave early as i had two flat viewings that evening with bob (the fiance mentioned in previous posts), one at 4:30 & one at 5. now at lunch time bob rang me to say he wasn't well & wouldn't be able to make the viewings, so i rang & cancelled the 4:30 one as it was a secondary viewing booked because he got held up at work last week & couldn't make it there last week & it seemed pointless viewing it alone again but we decided i should go to the other one & report back if it was any good. i told him to go to bed & get some rest then had some lunch before getting back to work.
i keep working on my presentation, 'scrubs' happily playing on in the background & before i know it, it's 3 o'clock. now usually i'd be out like a shot (not that i don't love my job but that office gets really hot & stuffy) but i'm doing well with my work & it won't take me two hours to get to this flat so i decide to get a drink then stick around till half past instead, not so long that i'd be late but long enough to get a bit more work done & one more episode of 'scrubs' to play, seems like a good plan, don't you think?

so i keep going till half past, i save, shut down, sign out & head for the bus stop. the bus is late of course, as usual but it eventually turns up & i get on & start my way to this flat. i get into town at about quarter to & worry i might be a tad late so i ring the estate agent to let them know just in case then head off to get the bus that will take me closer to where i need to be. this bus is also late but i get on & at 4:59 i am sitting in my seat on the top deck, waiting for us to move when suddenly another bus comes up to pull in at the stop just in front of the one my bus is at. 

now this particular street is part of a busy bus station that also allows general traffic, so at times this street can be packed with vehicles & clearly this particular bus driver doesn't have the patience to wait for anyone else to move so he can pull in & he obviously thinks that there's enough space for him to get past...he's almost right, almost. 

for a moment he glides past with ease then suddenly there's a horribly loud, wrenching, unfamiliar noise that sounds a lot like something breaking & quite a few people seem more than a bit concerned with the events unfolding outside of our bus. after about a minute or so we hear the inevitable sentence ""you'll have to get off & wait for the next one""...shit. we all pile off & only then to we see what's really happened, the moving bus has almost made it but for that darn protrusion at the front of our bus known as the wing mirror...which is now in two parts, the arm lying on the ground, abandoned by the actual mirror which is now residing on the dashboard inside the bus, a hitherto unexplored area now accessed due to the window now broken & spread across the road. the bus that was moving also has a broken window at the back (really hope no one was sat there at the time, there didn't seem to be anyone hurt thankfully). i look at this scene as anger flashes briefly through me, soon replaced by acceptance at my shitty luck, why am i surprised? i take out my phone to call the estate agent 

""sorry, i'm going to be later than expected, my bus was just hit by another bus"" 

""oh, wow, well we can wait around for you but we have to have the keys back at the office by half past so if you make it by twenty past you'll only have a few minutes to look around, you'll have to hurry, see you soon""

...shit. the time is now 5:18 & i'm trapped in the back corner of a completely packed single decker trying to hold everyone who just got off the double decker, panicking that when i get there a, i won't be able to get off because of all the people & b, the estate agent will have gone already.

at 5:25 i squeeze my way off the bus, apologizing to everyone i have to push past on my way, & run from the stop round the corner, following the dot on my phone & praying she's still there...she is, thank god! & after all that effort? it's not really that great, not what i was expecting & definitely not what bob & i are looking for, oh well, such is life, guess we'll just have to keep looking, eh?

"input: Text: i like hats. particular now that i'm going bald and need to protect my dome from the sun. but a hat can give a person character also. personally, i like stetsons, barmahs and panama hats. the gambler hat looks cool too but the undertaker pretty much killed the look for me from overuse. i even like the original federas - not these newer clown hats without a brim, many of them here being sold in tourist stores. 

right now i own a straw western type hat. it's not your atypical hat unless you are a mexican landscaper or do other work activities in the sun. underneath this, because i have a bald head, i wear a bandanna to keep the itch away, and to help keep my head cooler. 

today,  i wanted another hat. one with a bit more character than this straw hat. i want a barmah. i've been wanting another one for a while actually. i have had one in the past, though that one may not have been an original, it still did well. 

i charted a few hat store locations via google maps and knew of 2 from my past purchase of a barmah. all of these locations were on ""the strip"" in las ridiculous . right now i don't have a car so i'll be walking. the strip's not that far anyway. so i dressed for comfort and went out the door.

i've forgotten how hot it gets in vegas. at 12 pm at the start of my adventure,  it was already reaching 100. but that's ok. living here, i've learned to always bring water, no matter if it's just across the street, or across the desert. i have ran an average of 3 to 5 miles 3 times a week. but not in heat like this. the strip was about 5 miles away. on the way i made a few stops for more water. 

the first destination, the store didn't exist, nor did the second, or even the 3rd. in the process, i have walked the entire strip and back. and because of my running experience chose to run up and down steps instead of waiting on escalator tourists. 

my last hope was in the venetian. i had already past it because the old hat shop was in front nearby, but was no longer there, but the maps showed one near here. fuck it, i'll try the forum shops. they are a kind of upper class kind of place, specializing in name brands  and such. it really is the best place to have a name brand hat shop.

this place is huge! i was wandering around and seeing a lot of food court, so i figured it to be a good time for a restroom stop and to fill my bottle. then i found a cool shaving place and was a bit timid going in because i didn't really bring enough money for all that. after looking at a few creams and double edges, i basically stated, ""na, i better go before i start buying everything "" 

thinking back. this may have been the point that put me under radar.

i was still searching for this supposed store. if it exists. i checked the map but nothing popped out at me. i seen a group of security that i passed and turned around and asked them. one pointed me in a direction stating ""keep right"" 

""oh cool. how did i pass it?"" 

walked a ways staying on the right, past another fork because there didnt seem like anything down there. but didn't see anything else none the less. fine. lets try this other direction anyway.

 at that corridor, there now existed a big beef of a guy, dressed much differently than the other security.  he looked the part of 3rd world soldier minus the cigar and machine gun. and he was looking at me. but whatever, not my concern, though i noticed him turn in the same general direction as i went, but much more slower.down this corridor on the right was a restaurant, on the left i don't even remember. maybe a small gift shop, and in front of me was the exit. nope, nothing this way. i must have missed it again somewhere. i started back down the corridor while seeing this cuban dictator staring me down and started angling to stop me before i passed.

oh. fuck. i just realized i gone goofed. i was quite unshaven, and my shirt had a hole in it and probably looked like shit from all the sweat and salt of the day, and running up and down stairs. i also happened to be in need of new shoes. i definitely looked the part of the homeless man which are literately everywhere on the strip these days. 

""whatcha looking for?"" 

myself: ""oh, i am looking for a hat shop that's supposed to be in here or around the venison.""

""i think you have the wrong cassino.""

i took the hint. even if there was a hat store, they didn't want what appeared to them as homeless in their shops.

myself: "" oh ok, thank you""

feeling dejected i decided to walk back home.

10 waterbottles later and back home, i now understand why they call them sweatpants. i literally sweated in them the entire time. sitting down was not fun. i had a huge heatrash from my ass crack to the entire sack of my balls which burned like hell. it also felt like i went through leg day. probably because of those steps.

"input: Text: so this happened earlier this week at my university where i was running a bit late for my lecture. right outside the classroom there were two people fighting, a young lady in her late twenties and a man of about 40. the woman was clawing for the man's eyes and screaming ""kill him! kill him!"". the man was trying to pin her arms down and control her.

instead of intervening i walked up to them and asked if they wanted help. i was directing this to the man since people were standing around and one was calling for police. neither the man nor the woman replied and i continued in to my class. later when police came to the scene and i learned that the student had been banned from the school and had attacked the lecturer when he told her to leave it felt really silly that i hadn't helped him restrain her. it struck me much later how bizarre it was to ask two people fighting ""hey do you want some help?""   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

i decided to fry some breaded pork chops in my cast iron skillet. i get the oil to a nice hot 375 degrees and place my pork chops one at a time into the oil.

here's the laziness part of my fuck up: i go into my utensil drawer and there's only one clean fork left in there. i probably should have just gone into my dishwasher and cleaned a second fork for dining and used one for cooking, but like i said i was being lazy.

so, i cook the first pork chop to satisfaction and take it out of the oil. i am also hungry and start cutting open the pork chop after i put the second on in the oil. after flipping the second chop (using aforementioned only fork) i go back to my already cut up chop, and immediately take a piece to bite. of course, i didn't consider waiting a minute or so for the fork which i was just swishing around in the hot oil to cool down.

i now have a fork shaped second degree burn in the corner of my mouth and on my lips; but damn are these pork chops tasty.

"input: Text: long time lurker, first time poster. like most this f up occured quite a few years ago. almost 9 to be exact, the day before my 16th birthday. 

so i decided to hang out with my younger sister, and her two friends, one of which was a guy about her age. she is only a few years younger than me. we decided to head to this wooded part of a subdivision down the road the road from our house on bikes, its almost right acrossed the road from our local bmx track and there was a race going on at the time. 

being the younger rebels that we were, most of us had already picked up the habit if smoking so i always had a lighter on me. so not thinking about what could happen or the consequences that could happen after that. we started usong the lighter to light some pine needles on fire, i used it the first time and lit a small fire, seeing how quickly it spread i put it out. i was the oldest in the group and had more common sense than the other 3 even though it wasnt very much more.

so my sisters guy friend had asked to see my lighter, and of course being the dumbass i was, i let him use it. well he used it on a small fallen pine tree that happened to have a bunch of dead needles on it. the fire started to get pretty big so when i went to put it out he had stopped me and said wait a couple more seconds. i have no clue why i listened to him because in that couple seconds the fire became so unmanageable. our first instinct was to throw dirt on it, well thats wasnt quite working. next thing you know this fire is spreading acrossed this pine wooda quickly. 

so we did the next logical thing, because we didnt want to see any nearby homes catch fire, we called 911. at this point, this kid is panicking, talking about how he will get in so much trouble blah blah blah. i felt bad for him, he was a few years younger than me so i told him to take his bike and head home and i would deal with the police and firefighters even though mind you, he is the one who started that fire. i was already on juvenile probation at the time so i figured what else could it really hurt. later, did i find out it really couldve hurt alot. so he takes off for his house as quick as possible. 

next thing you know the police and firefighters show up and while the cops talking to me filling out a police report, the firefighters put out the fire. i told the cop that i had started the fire. he takes me and my sister home and tells my mom that i was lucky that i wasnt a day older or he would've taken me straight to juvenile detention.  

i almost got hit with a felony arson charge for that but my probation officer helped me get it down to a misdemeanor of unability to contain a fire and extended probation for six more months and i also had to take a couple fire safety courses courtesy of the fire department.

  i was sitting up waiting to start my next set while something awesomely bad happened. mid-curl, the older male turned his head to his right and sneezed right onto the younger gal. i saw projectile. in my mind i even felt the mist landing on her. i'm listening to cypress hill by the way. i took off my headphones to see this play out. the girl shrieked and then started to cry. the guy said he was sorry and walked away embarrassed. for some reason, i walked to the disinfectant, sprayed it on a paper towel and tried to hand it to her to maybe wipe her arms or something. she looked at me and said, ""and what the fuck is this going to do?"". she then took the paper towel spit on it and wiped it on my arm. then said,""there, now your clean right?""

"input: Text: so this didn't happen today, but it was over thanksgiving break in 2012. i lived in south lake tahoe, california, and my parents live in wisconsin. to start the story, i used to be prescribed a large amount of benzodiazepines (klonipin and xanax), as well as live in a city where marijuana is more than acceptable, and on the border of nevada so there are a dozen or so casinos just a few minutes away. if anyone has drank while taking xanax or any other type of benzo, you know that it is a recipe for blacking out, and often disaster.  in my infinite wisdom when i was 22 years old and in the middle of a xanax blackout, i decided to bring a quarter ounce of weed in my carry-on bag that i was packing for my trip home the next day. fast forward to a day later, my girlfriend is dropping me off at the airport in reno, nevada (the closest large airport) and i have taken so many pills that i can barely say goodbye, let alone walk myself into the airport and go through security. i didnt check a bag so all i had was my carry-on, and somehow i made it through security completely fine. i have about 40 minutes before my flight leaves at this point, and i decide to get a drink at the airport bar. i start talking to someone and lose track of time after a couple beers and i hear my name being announced over the loudspeaker. i had almost missed my flight, and i hurried to get on the plane. up until this point everything was fine and i was on my way home. i had a connecting flight in minneapolis that take me on the final leg home. after the flight takes off, i take a couple more of my 2 mg xanax and proceed to order some beers. i dont remember exactly how many beers i had on the plane, but it couldn't have been more than 4 or 5 . this combined with 20 plus milligrams of xanax caused me to go into a deep sleep. somewhere during the flight i passed out, however when it came time to get off the plane, no one could wake me up. i was breathing, but basically in a drug and alcohol induced coma. the police were called and they had to basically carry me out of the airport. the last thing i vaguely remember is walking out of the terminal with a police officer on both sides. the next morning at around 5 am i woke up, with both arms restrained in a hospital type bed. i immediately screamed, and a nurse came and untied me. i asked what happened, they informed me of the events, said they had talked to my dad and he had rescheduled my flight for later that morning, handed me all of my stuff along with a police report and my new plane ticket and told me to be on my way. i had a short walk to the airport from the hospital, and i began reading the police report. i had completely forgotten about the weed that i had in my backpack, and the police had found it. in the report it said that they found a container with ""medical marijuana"" in it, along with my empty bottle of prescription pills. they took the bud, but somehow i managed to escape that situation without any tickets or criminal charges. my family was extremely worried and disappointed when i didn't show up as scheduled, but in the end everything worked out.

 i have been so lucky multiple times in my life, and i thank god that i know better than to do this type of this now. i don't know if i ever actually got arrested either, this whole memory is kinda a blur for obvious reasons. my dad still has the copy of the police report that i was handed after this all happened. maybe i will ask him for it soon and post it if anyone is interested. i also have 2 or 3 other stories that involve me getting extremely lucky, i might post them later separately.

it's my sophomore year in hs and i'm trying my best to make friends and not let my social awkwardness get the better of me. i had this crush on a girl who we'll just refer to as sarah. i managed to finally get her to come to the mall with me and we actually have a pleasant time. but about an hour in we pass by a makeup shop... sarah, of course, gets this wonderful idea that it would be just amazing if she could do my makeup here. my awkward teenaged mind wasn't throwing any red flags, so i accepted. i'm in that shop for almost a full half an hour and she's finally doing the finishing touches on my previously ok face. she insist i don't get to see what i look like until we're done. but i already know what i look like. i see people staring from the main hall outside the store. i was socially adept enough to know that the faces people were making meant that i... looked... bad.

now that we're done with adding makeup to my face, i'm dying to get it off already. i look like the lead singers from kiss and slipknot had a cosmetic breakdown on my face. i legitimately looked like one of those troubled teens going through ""that phase,"" except to an extreme extent. now she's making me walk all around the mall. my mind is yelling at me to make her take it off, while on the outside i'm trying to nonchalantly walk with my friend like nothing's wrong. she has to use the restroom, so i get the pleasure of waiting outside facing everyone in the hall. i child looks at me, then to his mother he ask, ""mom why is that man so scary."" thankfully the mother didn't say anything, i might have collapsed in tears. sarah comes back out from the restroom, and i'm begging her to take it off. i become a bad friend for making her take my makeup off, thus ruining everything i worked towards getting on her good side. seriously, fuck the way everyone's mind worked at that age.

now we walk back into the makeup shop from earlier and an old friend of sarah's sees her. they we're about to make a quick exchange of greetings but then, she saw me. she quickly takes me to the back and does her best to remove/cover all of my makeup. she had already figured out how i got in this mess, because little words were exchanged between us and she had acted so quickly. she had basically told me not to do this to myself, which i made sure i haven't done since.

 

this fucking sucked and had it happened more recently, probably would have been recorded. thanks for reading, and i hope this'll make someone's day. also apologies if formatting is crap from my mobile.

for the past couple weeks, my mom has been meticulously planning a surprise birthday party for my sister, whose birthday is in late march. my sister loves surprises and my mom is trying to be extremely secretive about this party in order to really catch my sister off guard. my mom doesn't let anybody discuss details of the party while my sister is in the house and even created a fake email account to plan the party, just in case my sister somehow sees my mom's emails and discovers the surprise. as you can tell, my mom is really serious about this surprise party and wants to it to be a mind-blowing experience for my sister. as a result, my mom as booked a popular dj, a fashion lady (or something like that - i don't know the actual title) to give all the girls at the party make-overs and whatnot, as well several expensive birthday presents. the next step for my mom was to discreetly invite a bunch of my sister's friends (i think about 10-15 in total) by sending an email (using the fake email account) to each friend asking if they are available to attend the party.

here's where i get involved: 

i'm on facebook today looking at pictures and scrolling through my news feed just like any other day when one of my friends suddenly chats me. 

him: ""dude i got a weird email from your mom. i think she sent it to the wrong person.""

me: ""oh really? what is it about?""

him: ""it's an invitation for some girl named samantha to attend your sister's birthday or something. how did your mom even get my email address?""

me: ""hahaha. that must be for my sister's surprise birthday party. i have no idea how my mom sent *you* that email though. i'll go ask her.""

immediately after this conversation i try to ask my mom why she sent my friend that email. so usually when i try to ask my mom for something and she is in the living room and i am on the second floor of my house, i just yell really loudly to get her attention. so, without thinking, i scream, ""hey mom! why did you send an invitation to *friend's name* for *sister's name*'s party? i think you meant to send it to samantha!"" while i was so caught up in why my mom sent my friend that wrong email, i didn't realize that my sister's room was right next to where i was standing. i take a peek inside the room (somehow hoping that my sister didn't hear what i had just yelled) and much to my dismay, my sister is sitting on her bed where she was definitely able to hear everything that just happened. 

oops. needless to say, but my mom was pissed.

"input: Text: this happened back in 2010 when i was with a friend, it was the summer and we where both 12 years old. we both had passes to the local swimming pool. one day we are both getting changed in separate changing rooms, we would always grab 2 disabled one's because there was more space, friend gets changed really fast and has left his changing room. i didn't hear and didn't realise that a mentally retarded man had gone in the changing cubical he had just been in. during this he started to make loud moaning sounds, to which i thought it was my friend doing, so being immature 12 year old i was, i started to make them back thinking it was him, did it for about 3-4 minutes when i finally left the changing cubical i walked out to be greeted by friend wetting himself laughing about how he wasn't in the cubical and it was someone who was actually ill.

"input: Text: this happened the summer after my first year of college. i had my first vehicle, a red ford ranger. i was very proud of it. 
i went to a party and ended up flirting with a girl. she was sitting on my lap, holding my hand by the end of the night. when her friend told her it was time to go, i offered to take her home. this was my opportunity to look really cool by driving her home in that slouched back, one-handed way. no ten-and-two here. 
i pull up to her house and i'm feeling very confident. this is her parents house, so i'm not going inside, but i'm certain i can at least get some hot smooch action before i go. she thanks me for the ride and then we stare at each other for a few seconds. i decide to go in for the kiss slowly, real smooth-like. our lips meet and there is a single moment of sexiness before a loud bang and our heads jolt forward. turns out i hadn't put the truck in park, so when i leaned in for the kiss my foot was removed from the brake, resulting in me slowly rolling into the back of her dads car. 
her dad then came outside in his pajamas, yelled at me, assessed the damage (thank god there was none) and sent me on my way. i drove off in my tiny sad truck and never heard from her again.

"input: Text: so it started as a normal depressing summer day where i have no friends and nothing to do so i sept all day. well eventually my mom got her form of concerned with a little pissed mixed in and told me to do something, so naturally i call my bro and set up a bro date as my girlfriend likes to call it. so we're going to a classic rock concert on friday so we went to buy zippo lighters yesterday but forgot to buy lighter fluid. so we go to walmart today to get that lighter fluid and ended up walking out of there with 2 bb guns along with the lighter fluid we were looking for... idk how we talked ourselves into it, but we did. so anyways were outside my house in his car opening the bb guns and we had to break zip ties. well my idiot of a friend decides instead of scissors let's use his pocket knife. it goes just about as well as you think it would and i slice my hand open. so i'm sitting there like ""shit"" as blood streams down my arm. my friend says ""lets go inside and get me cleaned up"" and i'm like ""hell no"" cause if my mom found out i bought a bb gun she'd kill me after making several you'll shoot your eye out jokes. so he's just like ""well what do you think we should do"", so i tell him to drive to walmart, we'll buy a first aid kit and clean me up in the bathroom. he's like ""you have blood down your arms"" and i'm like ""no one will notice if we don't make a scene now drive!"" so we get there and the first thing that happens is we see our friend's mom and she, being a mom stops and is all like ""oh hi!"" and goes in to hug us. well i'm sitting here like ""shit"" cause i don't wanna stain her shirt so when she hugs me i keep my hand off of her shirt to keep it from staining. so then i run into the bathroom, my friend buys the first aid kit and we patch me up.

"input: Text: first things first - i am usually against using herbicides and/or pesticides for home lawncare. last july, however, i needed to fill some cracks in my driveway. the only problem? dandelions were growing in the cracks. so, like any honest son of a pei homeowner, i found an old container of concentrated weedout and went to work.

conveniently, the container had a built-in spray nozzle attached to a tube - no need to tilt it and risk spilling it anywhere. if i'm going to use herbicide, might as well minimize the impact, right? so i happily sprayed each and every dandelion i saw in the driveway. great! there's still half the bottle left for next year! so i put the container on a shelf in the shed, washed my hands, and forgot about it.

today, i opened the shed and looked at the shelf. the nozzle was sitting on the shelf next to the mostly emptied container - fuckfuckfuck - surrounded by a sticky puddle of half-crystallized weed killer. i figured out that the tube had still been full when i put it away - the container acted as a siphon, emptying itself out. now i can look forward to cleaning up some carcinogens tomorrow :|. so much for minimizing spill damage.

"input: Text: actually happened last night.  my wife and i were going to get jiggy with it, but i had drank a couple beers and she hates the smell on my breath.  no biggie, figured i would just swish some listerine.  the problem is, instead of the usual light flavor she usually buys, my wife had picked up the cinnamon flavor.  i found it intense as hell but i didn't think it would be an issue.  well i must have had some of it left on my tongue, cause when i went downtown to vaginatown she screamed bloody murder, accidentally kneed me in the face, and ran out of the room.  i found her in the kitchen rubbing an ice cube on her poontang.

"input: Text: i was riding the bus home this morning after working a 12-hour night shift without much sleep before work. i did what i usually do on the ride home, which consists of alternating between passing out and waking up every thirty seconds or so. for some reason the combination of falling asleep and the vibrations from sitting over the rear wheel of the bus commissioned a rigid, throbbing, leaning tower of mushroom meat in my pants. i woke up after a middle aged, southeast asian lady occupied the seat next to me, her legs awkwardly touching mine and her breast rubbing against my arm with every pothole as we shared a seat in the confined rear corner of this stinking vessel for the disabled and vehicularly challenged.   
  
i panicked. my stop was approaching and i was battling a trouser dragon which i could not slay. her unintended grinding and the bumpy road certainly did not help my cause. i considered riding the bus all the way around town until my man steak returned to medium rare, but this was not an option as i had to be home to let my girlfriend in, who did not yet have a key to the apartment.  
  
so i pressed the button to signal the driver to stop, planning in detail how i would exit the bus without alerting my fellow passengers to the angle of my dangle. i would put my backpack in front of my junk, stand up, and walk out the back door. the perfect crime.  
  
**where i fucked up:** as i stood up, i dropped my bag. no fear, i thought, her satellites haven't detected my surface-to-air missile yet, i will just bend over and pick up my knapsack and carry on. so i did, i bent over, inadvertently tucking my cock rocket back behind my legs. as soon as i retrieved my back pack and stood up, i noticed she was getting up from her seat. too late. wrong place, wrong time, one inch too far. in a cruel twist of fate, the instant she arose from her seat, my beef torpedo launched from between my legs and slapped her square in the jaw. fucking track pants allowed maximum velocity, too. nothing but jeans from now on.   
 
  
i was off the bus and running for my life before i had a chance to witness the look of horror that was undoubtedly pasted on her face. i am never riding that bus again. *never.*

"input: Text: okay, so i have just created an account after lurking and getting schadenfreude from posts here, it is only fair that i return the favour. 

i work at a supermarket in new zealand as a grocery assistant, nothing fancy but it pays the bills for now. a big complaint i have about my uniform is that it is not well suited for physical work, the trousers are especially inflexible which results in tears down the seam of the pants. i have been fed up with resewing time and time again and have elected to use a few safety pins threaded through the split to keep my trousers together until i can be bothered fixing them.

so, work as usual yesterday and i am walking back to where i am working, and i decided to walk through the least crowded aisle, which contains snack foods on one side and baby needs and wax, condoms and lube on the other. there are only a couple of young guys down there, i'd guess mid twenties, and when i get closer i see that they are a couple, no big deal to me. they take little notice of me and are looking at the lube. as i pass them however, my pants feel a bit weird, they are moving just slightly strangely on me and that is when i feel one of the safety pins stabbing into my upper inner thigh and i yelped ""jesus that hurts!"" whilst clutching that backside of my trousers and limping off, only to look back at them to see if they heard me out of mild embarrassment. i was not even thinking about what it looked like, until i saw one of them scowling at me, his partner merely nonplussed with the lube in his hand. i turned back the direction i was heading in disbelief at what i had just done and feeling absolutely awful. 

so yeah, i would say i fucked up.

so we did all that vacuuming and changing sheets and putting the garden chair back in its proper place, a man even came over to clear dead leaves from the drain pipes ... huh, even i got into the game pretty deep. bunny skipped to the garage to get some super glue to put the wallpaper bits back and it ended up exploding in my hand, damn 99p glue!

friend finally arrived and i had to 'shake' her hand with the glue tube still stuck on my finger. mom gave me a dirty look but friend is a pretty chill person and said ""i know exactly what happened."" afterwards mom served dinner in our normal plastic plates.

"input: Text: my wife ""w"" and i ""m"" have been having a semi-regular dates and threesomes with a friend of ours ""g"". this past weekend i was hanging out with g bur w could not come. this happens occasionally. it wasn't a big deal. we had a little (lot) too much to drink. i know that i was getting tired and we had to be up in the morning. this is where i really fucked up. i was pretty drunk and though to myself ""m, you would rather sleep in a bed than on the couch"". i suggested that its getting late and we should head to the bedroom and talk until we get some sleep. i lay next to her and our bodies still remember vividly each others touch. my head is a bit fuzzy but i tell myself that i will just sleep, it will be nice and wake up refreshed. she pushes up against me which i think is nice so i don't fight it. then i put my arms around her and try to tell myself to sleep. my little buddy isn't sleeping but i try just keep still. she then proceeds to take my hands and feel herself up. after a min or two i kinda draw my hands away. she then removes her top and bottom and is sitting on top of me in just her underwear. she asks if she should continue and i say i don't think so. i say that while it is feeling good i really can't trust myself to make the decision to go ahead. she says to me ""what did you expect by coming into my bed"" which made sense at the time. ""i'm sure w thinks its ok"" that in hindsight was a bit of a stretch. ""you are in my bed, that means you want it"". i could only think that she would hate me if i said no. so i caved in. i did enjoy it (she is gorgeous, has a great body, stamina, and is quite talented). i remember feeling that i had to keep focusing on pleasing her, i couldn't focus on myself. after a few hours of that we went to sleep and the next morning i was kinda still drunk. i want sure if i was feeling a hangover or regret the next day. i haven't told w yet. i don't know how. we are all supposed to hang out in a few weeks. i guess i feel really guilty and dumb for getting myself into a situation i couldn't back. i fucked up. i'm a dick. i kinda hate myself. lay it on me.

"input: Text: this actually happened sunday, but started about a week ago. i woke up at 3am with severe pain in my chest and left arm. my first though was ""shit, i'm having a fucking heart attack!"". i'm 44m and takes meds for anxiety, so my second thought was that a panic attack or stress made a lot more sense. i grabbed my phone and googled the symptoms, and panic attack did fit. i had no other symptoms. wasn't sweating, no shortness of breath. no rapid heartbeat. it went away after about 20 minutes, and i went back to sleep.

a few days later i decided to walk on my treadmill and after 3 minutes i had some mild chest discomfort. it quickly went away with rest, so i called and made an appointment with my doctor on thursday. ekg was normal. he assumed stress, but was a bit concerned that pain came back with activity. we scheduled an appointment to see a cardiologist for monday. 

on saturday night at bedtime i had pain again, but seeing as the ekg was normal, i ignored it. same thing sunday, but figured i'd go to the er and get another ekg just in case. that one also looked normal, but after checking the one from thursday they noticed a ""subtle difference"" and decided i needed to be at a bigger hospital. 

i arrived at that hospital at 1am monday morning. by 9am i had a stent in the left anterior descending artery (also known as the ""widow maker"") of my heart due to a 95% blockage. the cardiologist and nurses all said i was lucky to be alive, and had i waited i likely would have had a heart attack. due to where the blockage was, that would have killed me before i could have gotten medical help.

"input: Text: this happened when i was fifteen. for background i grew up in hickville, usa and the high school i went to was crazy. about 95% of the guys chewed (really dipped as everyone had copenhagen rather than redman) tobacco or smoked. people were showing up drunk on the daily. people got expelled for bringing guns onto campus so they could sell them (this was after columbine and newtown, and shame on the school's administration for not locking down the school each time they knew about it).  almost everyone carried knives. i was in the majority that used tobacco. around that time i was dipping like crazy. 

the night before the fuck up i was caught by my dad (an essentially straight edge man who rarely drank and never smoked anything in his life) while i had a massive dip in.  i swallowed the fat dip i had in so naturally i threw up (i couldn't stomach it at all) a lot. i had just gotten three cans of grizzly that day and didn't want to waste them. so the next morning i faked being sick so i could stay home as i didn't sleep that night.  

so onto the fuck up. i decided to get rid of the cans by dipping them off quickly rather than throw away two and a half cans of wintergreen flavored cancer. i got through the half can and had the biggest nicotine buzz of my life. i then open the second can and put one in while resisting the urge to vomit as at that point me and wintergreen weren't friends. a few minutes later i put another in. i repeat until half of can #2 is gone. 

i then get the familiar gagging and run to the bathroom. i managed to lose half of my stomach acid as i hadn't eaten anything. i got up and was really fucking dizzy, like the house is spinning  at 50 miles an hour. my heart was racing and i was shaking so a lot.  my stomach hurt a lot and i felt like i was still going to vomit. i then went into my room and sat down for a bit. i still felt like i was going to pass out. i got up and laid on the clothes strewn across my bedroom for about an hour. i didn't move aside from the shaking and it still felt like the house was spinning. i ended up blacking out for twenty minutes or so.

i got up and went to the living room and sat on the couch for another hour. then the fog of dizziness and nausea slowly faded away.  you would have thought that that would have swayed me from ever touching that stuff again but that wasn't the case. i ate a leftover steak and opened the can again and dipped more. the exact same thing happened again. i stopped once and for all that day. looking back now i realize what a fucking idiot i was. i'm lucky i didn't fucking die. to this day if someone opens a can around me my stomach does violent barrel rolls.

the day before follow up surgery, we find out we don't have coverage, just over 3 months passed last payment so i don't think there is anyway to fix this. went from everything going great, to catastrophy

got the explanation of benefits and the total cost is a little over $20,000. i'm just thankful it's not more, but it easily could be.

"input: Text: i tend to write rather long posts, so  

so long time lurker here but this is my first post. 

mandatory 'did not happen today' but actually two years ago. posting though as my friends still enjoy laughing at it. 

i started learning guitar about 3 years ago. all self-taught by youtube and i became rather comfortable playing the instrument. 

i had progressed quite a bit when my friend and i decided to enter our school's interhouse music competition. we got a band together and entered a group piece. i would be playing guitar and singing. 

my music teacher at school had recently discovered that i could play guitar and sing so she asked me to also enter in a solo piece. i considered this and finally decided to enter as i thought 'hey, it's a good way for me to get out of my comfort zone right?' 

to give you an idea what i was like then, i was shy. i was able to talk in front of 5 people but the moment the group got larger than that, i got stage fright. now what was i thinking registering to play in front of the whole school. 

my band practiced everyday for weeks before the show and i could play and sing the songs in my sleep. unfortunately this left me very little time to practice my own piece. i would practice quickly before leaving for school or before bed, but never enough until i was confident with the piece. 

the night of the show arrives and my band is pumped. we've practiced this over and over again. we were determined to nail this performance. i on the other hand was not feeling that great about my solo piece. 

the show starts and i am to perform my solo piece third and then our band will perform after interval.

the second performance begins and i plug in back stage and get ready. i am practically struggling to stand up straight. second performance finishes and the mc goes up to announce me while i stumble on stage, trembling. i'm thankful for the spotlight which prevents me from seeing the crowd,  but i'm sure it illuminated my embarrassed face even more. the sound engineers give the thumbs up that i can begin. 

i start playing jeff buckley's hallelujah, remembering the lyrics and notes. first verse goes well and i get through the chorus. when i reach the second verse though i suddenly blank. i stop right there on stage in front of my school, trying to figure out what the note was, but my mind was mush. nothing. i do the next appropriate thing i can think of and apologise profusely to the audience. i then, in an obviously shaky voice ask the judges if i may restart. they nod and i start again. 

this time i start and play the song. i missed out the last verse but i keep telling myself that no one notice. i also found out later that i played the wrong chords and sounded completely off, but i was just thankful that it was over and found relief in the fact that i wouldn't have to face my peers until... i played for my band in half an hour. my mortified self realised that my embarrassment would have to be short lived. 

my band finds me during interval, trying to hide my face, and we get ready. instruments are tuned and, after warming up, my voice feels brilliant.

we go on stage and we kill it. we absolutely nailed the song and received a standing applause. 

i definitely fu my first performance but i stepped out of my comfort zone and as a result am much more confident now. this may sound strange, but i'm kind of glad i fu, at least now it can't get worse (i hope). 

tl;dr signed up for a school music competition. forget the words of my solo and made a fool of myself in front of my school but saved my reputation (well most of it) with my band's performance. thank you band! all in all i'm glad i did it as it built confidence.

sorry there hasn't been one yet, but nothing's happened. bit of an anti climax really:

i raised it with my girlfriend by asking to talk about ""those texts i sent you"" and she had no idea what i was talking about. i gave a bit more detail without giving too much away and it was clear they'd never gone through.  

my ipad is wifi only, and so only those people on ios received the messages, meaning the gf and mother are none the wiser. 

in any case, it wasn't something i was actively hiding, it just never came up. i abhor lying and will always tell the truth if asked, so i thought fuck it and told her what i'd sent (without the gruesome details), she was nonplussed, asked a couple of expected questions and semi-jokingly told me that she would cost more. then we ate a pizza. 

so while my mom didn't receive the messages, my sister definitely did, and would have told her about them, in how much detail i don't know. i still haven't spoken to either of them but there's still a chance of a minor shitstorm.

i'll update again if any lols come out of this.

"input: Text: my son has been in college since last fall. last november, my 16 year old stepdaughter brought up allegations that my son had abused her repeatedly for several years. i confronted my son and he categorically denied it. but i knew that even though he was my son, i could not defend him for such an awful act.

my wife and i reported him to the authorities. my son was arrested in december and held in prison for a several weeks because i refused to provide him bail money. he was eventually expelled from his ivy league college.

in the middle of january, my stepdaughter broke down and admitted she lied about everything. she had actually been having sex with her boyfriend and was scared the news would reach us.

the charges were dismissed and my son was released immediately but the damage was done. his first girlfriend from college ended things with him. the news spread about the allegations and all his childhood friends have decided to just stay away from him even though i called each and every one of them personally.

i have called the school and explained the situation and even though they sympathized, they said he needed to reapply for the next school year and go through the admissions process again. 

my son is understandably furious at us. he has moved back home and refuses to talk to me at all. both my wife and i have apologized to him repeatedly. we have banned my stepdaughter from our home permanently and she has been sent to live with her father in another state. my wife and i also agreed to completely disinherit her from our wills. it has been a very painful situation. all of us started therapy.

the realization of how badly i ruined my son’s life hit me when i picked up his first prescription of anti-depressants today. i bawled my eyes out in my car.

he is the pride and joy of my life. he is outgoing, funny, intelligent and the kindest person i know. but when i handed him his medication, i could not even recognize him. he locks himself in his room, does not eat properly and has lost several pounds so far. 

whenever i try talking to him, i just see the hate he has for me in his eyes. i don’t know if i can ever get him to love me again.

i know he is on reddit very often. t, if you are reading, i want to tell you again how sorry your stepmom and i are. i promise i will get you into college again. i know i can’t get you back the year you lost. but i will do everything in my power to make this right. everything i have has always been for you. i hope you will give me a chance to fix this. i love you so much it hurts. i failed as a father and i hope one day you will forgive me.

"input: Text: just an hour ago, i thought it would be a good time to work on my car. i was applying some vinyl to my car but needed a blow dryer to finish the installation but because the outlet is in my garage, i had to move my car closer on the driveway so it can reach. now instead of having to turn my car on and back it up two or three feet up the driveway, i thought it would be a great idea to just roll it up the driveway (the driveway is mostly flat, just an extremely slight decline). my car has a manual transmission so all i did was put the car into neutral and let the parking brake down. i pushed from my door frame with my left hand but when that wasn't enough, i pushed the spokes of my rear wheel with my right hand. all was going well until i felt a jolt in my back and that's what i knew i fucked up. after gathering all of my remaining strength, i quickly let go, pulled the parking brake, and fell on the floor in agony. now i cannot stand up straight without an overwhelming amount of pain and it doesn't help that i am leaving on a month-long international trip in a few days.

"input: Text: so i moved away from home for the first time at the beginning of this semester, and i've been putting off doing my laundry basically this whole time. i don't have any washing machines in my building, so it's just a big inconvenience i'd like to avoid. anyways after going commando  for a couple of days (which i've discovered is actually wonderful) i finally conceded. 

i don't have any laundry detergent, so i go to the store to pick some up , how hard could it be. well apparently there are a lot of different kinds of laundry detergent, and seeing as i usually just use whatever's around the house i get a little bit lost. luckily, my friend zack is with me and he points one out, ""this one's good,"" he says. "" it smells great."" so i buy it , go home, throw my clothes in a garbage bag (a pretty big garbage bag, considering how long i've avoided laundry) and head out.
the washing machines seem pretty standard, so i pour my detergent in, start it, and then sit around and wait. an hour later it's done and dry, so i throw it back in the garbage bag and head home to fold them. 

as soon as i take them out of the bag the smell hits me, and it's not bad, it's just familiar. memories start pouring in to my mind as this smell rushes through my nostrils, and that's when i realize that i bought the same detergent my ex-girlfriend uses. my whole wardrobe now smells like her now.

"input: Text: so this actually happened about a week ago when my girlfriend and i moved into our new place.

we had just finished consummating our new home and smoking a celebratory first house blunt when we decided to go smoke a cigarette. now, going outside is something we never had to do before to smoke a cig. we'd just open a window in the apartment we used to live in and smoke inside. this being the first night at the new place we hadn't properly learned all the locks and what not on the doors. mainly the doorknob locks. never had those before at the apartment, just bolt locks. so happily we go outside in our pjs, me in gym shorts and a crappy white tshirt i had on for most of the day, and her in capitals boxers with an expressions of darth vader tshirt on. both in flip flops. as soon as i shut the back door i knew i had fucked up as i could feel how the knob was locked literally a second too late. i turned to my girl with a look of terror and she knew immediately that i had just caused a first homeowners mistake and locked ourselves out of our house...in our pjs...at midnight...both cell phones upstairs in the bedroom...at about an [8]. we tried all the windows, which were locked, and contemplated breaking a window (as she put it, we have a year to fix it so whatever). of course we ended up deciding to just suck it up and go to a neighbors house, none of which we had met yet. she suggested i go by myself as she was embarrassed to which i responded there's no way in hell anyone in their right mind would open their front door for a guy that looks like me (big beard, big guy, in pjs) at midnight and that having her was essential to getting someone to let us use their phone. 

so we started knocking. we got through about three houses before finally someone opened their door for us. it was a nice asian man and what i presume was his just woken up by our knocking grandma or mother who didn't speak english. i should mention he didn't speak english very well either so it took about five minutes of explaining why we needed his phone and that yes, we really were his neighbors. luckily he had seen our moving truck and believed us.  the whole time they're just staring at my girlfriend probably due to the mix of funny clothing, sex hair, stoned eyes, and no bra while i frantically call my dad so he can bring the spare key out (for the life of me i don't know what made me make an extra earlier that day at home depot, but it saved our ass). after hanging up we thanked him, rosy cheeked and all, as we went to leave. he offered to let us hang out there until my father came but we were way too embarrassed to sit there any longer. my dad decided it was hilarious so he went and picked my mom up and bought some coffees (all the time we're outside in pjs like where the fuck is he?!) to bring over. he was giggling and doing a little dance as he walked up to the house, i guess he thought it was funny as hell (we did too honestly, i'm sure the weed helped). all in all it turned out to be a pretty funny experience, and not gonna lie, i did it again a day later but luckily we had our phones and my dad was close by so we didn't have to go through anything embarrassing again. needless to say we have a hidden key now, but we never lock the doorknob lock anymore anyways. now every time i call my dad he starts off by answering with ""please, not again."" honestly, i can't help but laugh and think of how awesome a story it is for our first night living together. oh, and the house is fucking awwwwesome!

fast forward several hours later to this morning, i'm in the bathroom getting ready for my day. my mind begins to wander when i notice a small, red blob on my shorts. i thought, ""oh! jam!"" i swiped it up with my finger and stuck in my mouth, licking it clean. hmm.... it doesn't taste very sweet. and the texture is a bit mucousy. wait.... i used grape jam. we don't even *have* any strawberry jam. then what did i...? oh. oh my god. ooooh shit. what the fuck did i just put in my mouth? fucking fuck! ack! i began to gag a bit. it was a clot of blood. menstrual blood. i ate my own goddamn fucking menstrual blood and it didn't even *taste good*!!!

"input: Text: alright so this happened about 6 months ago but it's probably the stupidest decision i've ever made in my life and quite the story to tell. so anyway my best friend and i were bored over the summer and would always go to ikea/various stores and entertain ourselves usually involving building toilet paper/ mattress forts or even playing kickball in a variety of stores. anyway we were at ikea late at night over the summer and entered a big storage area of the store with 5-6 story high shelves loaded with furniture and cardboard boxes. keep in mind the store closed at 9 and we were in there around 9:45-10....
trying our best not to make any noise or get caught, i thought'd it'd be sweet if we could climb up some of these storage shelves 50-60 ft above the ground and just chill out. so he told me to go first and i just made my way up, realizing it probably wasn't the safest idea we ever had, but hey we were teenagers looking for some fun. so i get about halfway up the structure (30-40 ft) swing my leg up to get higher. i wasn't really focusing on where my leg was going and smacked it on a metal bracket that held the shelf up. at first i didn't really think much of it because it didn't hurt at all and just thought it would bruise up the next day. however, as i pulled myself to my feet on the next shelf, i felt something drop down my leg and sure enough i've got a massive gash on my kneecap and i'm gushing blood all over assorted furniture and cardboard boxes. like these things are soaked and the blood continues to drip shelf by shelf onto more ikea products.
at this point my friend starts to begin to notice what's going on and starts to freak out. i'm working my way down so we can get to an urgent care or something when an ikea employee appears and begins to stock the shelves just below me. this is the point where i'm honestly worried for my life. meanwhile i just wait for this guy to stock his cardboard boxes while i'm sweating bullets 5 ft above him, all the while losing massive amounts of blood which continues to spill on ikea products. he eventually leaves and i make my way down. however, because the store had already closed, these metal barriers had separated the doors from this storage area for god knows what reason. anyway, my friend and i proceed to hop this barrier (still bleeding) and find our way to the men's room. we spent the next 45 minutes stopping the bleeding and making sure we wouldn't get caught on the way out if they hadn't already found the trail of blood we had left. at around 10:45 we stopped hearing the construction sounds/ banging of boxes and decided it was time. we ran out the door( me limping) and booked it down an escalator to my car, hearing people yelling behind us but not stopping for anything. he drove me home where we put cleaned up the wound and had to tell our parents the stupid decision i had made😂. we went to urgent care the next morning and got my knee stitched it up, explaining to my doctor how exactly it had happened. still wondering what they thought about the incident/ how they took care of the blood i left up there😂

edit: 3-4 months later, ikea issued a statement telling it's customers the dangers of hiding/horseplay in their stores and said they found numerous examples of the dangers of these activities

"input: Text: so this story happened a while ago, but when i told it to a friend of mine he urged me to post it here. so here goes..

i was at a party in a flat where only students live and at a certain time i was getting pretty intoxicated. i’m not quite sure how it started, but at some point i was making out with this girl, let’s call her emily, who lived on the same floor the party was at. we wanted some more privacy and thus she was dragging me to her room, which had been seen by some other girls. i think for the story it’s good to know that most people knew each other at this party. the girls who saw us were friends of emily and they all had another friend who i had hooked up with a while before this party. anyway, we entered the bedroom, locked the door and things were progressing to the point where we were no longer wearing clothes. the girls who spotted us thought emily couldn’t do this to their mutual friend and they were banging on the bedroom door. we were pretty drunk and the banging on the door, combined with screaming was kind of disturbing. in fact, emily thought she could convince her friends that i was not in her room, so that they would leave and we could continue. she quickly put some clothes on, but obviously i had to hide and the only place our drunk minds could think of was her closet. so while she was telling her friends to leave, i was hiding in the closet. i honestly believe they could still see my clothes on the floor though.

they soon left though and we were able to continue. about 10 minutes later, i think, they were back and we were getting annoyed. once again she opened the door to tell them to leave. this time i just hid under the blankets; she asked me to. they obviously knew emily wasn’t alone, but she thought she would just say it was someone else who was with her. the girls actually came in the room and i heard them talking right beside me. one person actually sat down on the bed, but that might have been emily as well, i never found out. i was just not giving a fuck (literally) and waiting for them to finally leave, which they eventually did.

 however, this is when shit got weird.. before we went to sleep, i had to pee. emily didn’t want me to go to the toilet, because then her friends would see me coming out of her bedroom. she suggested i used some sort of bucket she had in her room. so, i was peeing in a bucket in her bedroom, which was really strange to me. i remember thinking, why am i even doing this? i was honestly happy that i could sleep after that. in the middle of the night i woke up, when i noticed she was moving around. i was half asleep and not really sure if i was seeing things right, but it seemed as if she was peeing next to the bed. i’m not sure if she realised it, or maybe she thought the bucket was there or something. all i know is that she was still very drunk and i just fell back asleep. and then the morning sun rose and we were both waking up. i just wanted to go home asap and got out of bed to search for my clothes. and then i saw them lying next to the bed, on her side. i remembered waking up in the middle of the night, but i was hoping i had it all wrong. i did not. i picked up my clothes and they were wet. my jeans, shirt and vest had been freaking pissed on. the only thing i thought of was the fact that i had to cycle home for about 20 minutes, and i could not do that in my underwear only. so i just sucked it up, put on my pissed on clothes, cycled home and showered for about an hour while thinking: what the hell happened? emily and i never spoke of the pissed on clothes. i think she was too drunk to remember and i just found it way too awkward to tell her.

 

edit: okay so people seem to think the vest is weird. i'm also not sure if vest is the correct word, maybe its a cardigan. at least this is what it looks like: http://www.asos.com/asos/asos-cardigan-in-teal-green-cotton/prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=6359938&cid=7617&sh=0&pge=0&pgesize=36&sort=-1&clr=teal&totalstyles=462&gridsize=3

"input: Text: today i fucked up. after a long shift at work in a restaurant, i sat down on the porcelain throne for my ""evening constitutional."" (i promise that the details about defecation are necessary to set the mood, but that the post doesn't ""center"" around them.)

the men's room here has two urinals and one stall, the latter of which i'm occupying - and i tend to take my time when i go about my business. the stall is excessively large, with room for a diaper changing table and enough handicap access area to fit one and a half hoverounds. the partition blocks off the entire bathroom width (maybe five or six feet), with the door situated in a way that, upon entering the stall, one would have to make a ninety degree turn to navigate to the toilet.

i'd finished dropping the cosby kids off at the community pool and begun my paperwork when i heard a new party enter the bathroom: a trio of voices - two high pitched, one normal masculine - that i can only assume is a father and his two kids. as per usual, they beeline straight for the single stall, and quickly find that the door is locked.

this is not the first time that i've been in this situation in this restroom - last time, an intoxicated fellow decided to have a full conversation with me through the stall walls as he waited not-so-patiently outside. despite the inherent humor in the bawdy conversational material that the man had chosen to regale me with, i was distinctly unhappy at having my poo party-of-one crashed.

i hoped to avoid the same fate this time by ignoring all other would-be stall users. so as this man and his two kids began knocking on the door, i carefully folded the two-ply into a nice stack and lifted my rear off the seat for a big, hopefully final, wipe.

it was this most compromising moment when i caught a flash of motion in the edge of my vision. i look up to see a young girl, maybe five years old, on her hands and knees, half-entered into my private lounge. her eyes get big with surprise.

i make emergency maneuvers, but it is too late. the angle is just right that she had a clear view of my dingling-dangling wonder worm. 

""daddy, it's a boy!"" she gasps, as she retreat crawls back. 

""fucking christ!"" i exclaim, just as astonished (it's a *girl*!) as she at this pickle of a situation.

the father makes an unhappy grunt and yanks his offspring to her feet. i hurry the rest of my visit and shuffle out where we all avoid eye contact.

"input: Text: this happened when i was 7 years old.  


i lived in suburban midwest us, where all the kids in the neighborhood could walk alone to the park and each other's houses well across town.  my best friend lived on the other side of the park and for some reason i had this idea that it would be fun to write her an anonymous letter giving hints about which friend i was, and then inviting her to meet me at the park later to see if she had guessed correctly
.

i decided that the letter had to be typed so the handwriting wouldn't give me away.  this was 1997 and computers were so new that microsoft word was entertaining.  i had played pretend secratary enough that i had taught myself to print addresses on an envelope.  i typed up this long letter and gave her 3 clues describing who i was and set a future date for her to meet me.
    
a week or so goes by and i've pretty much forgotten about the letter when we get a frantic phone call from my friend's mom asking if i had received any suspicious mail.  she was so upset when she saw the letter that she went immediately to the police.  due to the typed envelope and the advanced grammar (thanks mom) the police believed there was no way this letter was from a 7 year old but surely a local child molester.  then undercover agents were sent to stake out the park and wait for his arrival.
her mom was calling all the parents in town warning them to check the mail and be on the lookout for local predators.

i got grounded *for lying about my involvement  at first* for quite awhile and was scared straight after i had to tell my story to the policeman.  whoops.

"input: Text: help me. i fucked up so bad. i don't know where i am. i don't know what is real and what is not. i think my computer and my phone is the only way i can communicate with the real world. fuck.

these were exactly my thoughts at the apex of my fuck up. 

i've never been a person to really use drugs or alcohol, but i decided to go on a hike with some friends where 7 (out of 8) of us decided to trip on shrooms. i've had my fair share with alcohol and weed, but i've always started out slow and built up a pretty good tolerance and gauge of my limits. this time however, i decided to start with 3 grams which supposedly is the regular dose (we found out later that the scale was broken and it was closer to 4 grams). for 5 of us, it was our first time. i took the lowest dose, with one of my friends taking 6 grams. 

we finally got to the beginning of the trail and we all ate our shrooms. the trail was about 1.3 miles long and we began walking. roughly 20 minutes in and my friends were beginning to trip, there was a nice waterfall or something at the end of the trail so we really wanted to make it; however, after half an hour or so we found a flat area where we decided we had to sit down.

until we sat down, i had felt little to nothing. then it hit me like a brick wall. almost immediately after sitting down, the ground beneath me starting moving. i've always been skeptical of hallucinogenics so i thought i was maybe just dehydrated from the heat. i drank water, and the trees started to move. i realized this shit was real, i was tripping. i saw light streaks, the trees moved like the optical illusion with leaves. i was feeling a lot of things at this time, just laughing a lot, it felt a little hard to breathe, but i was having a good time. the sky would turn from blue to green to purple and back to blue. i was just seeing crazy shit. this phase lasted from around 3pm to 5 pm. i was tripping balls but i still remember roughly what happened. after 5 pm...not so much.

the last thing i do remember between 5pm - 8pm is when my friends ask if we're ready to go. i think there's a general consensus of yes. 

i wake up in a car, with half of my friends. i think i've passed out for a long time. i check my phone...""8:30 pm"". i think to myself, there's no way i was out for only 3 hours. if i was, how the fuck am i in a car? the only possible solution? i was in a dream.

i vaguely remember my friends being hostile to me, but for no reason. constantly telling me to ""stop"" and then asking me if i was okay. it was scary, i didn't know what i did wrong. i remember trying to talk to get the attention of the sober member of my group, but not really sure why. i then remember being choke slammed into dirt by one of my friends. this really hurt in my mind. a lot. (apparently my friends told me later that i was trying to touch her hair and getting her to turn around and that resulted in me being slammed into the ground by my friend who took 6 grams.) at this point, the slamming, the hostility, it all felt unreal. it added to the idea that i was stuck in a dream world. i hadn't really woken up. i feel cuts on over my body and i feel a little sore, but i thought my mind was just compensating for when i got slammed in my dream.

i felt like it was really hard to move my body. i felt a cold breeze and it took almost 15 minutes to realize i wasn't wearing a shirt and i finally put it on. i looked at my friend, he was smoking from a bong. i saw the smoke come out and a couple seconds later i could smell the weed. it was a very weird disconnect between my senses. nothing felt right. they were still asking if i was okay from time to time but i couldn't really respond. they would occasionally say ""wooo! we made it."" i thought my mind was fabricating all of this. i was definitely not feeling okay, and these ""projections"" of my friends were trying to make me feel better.

i'm stuck in a car for over an hour, studying these projections, trying to figure out how i can tell they aren't real. i check my phone...no notifications, no messages, no phone call from my mom even though i've been passed out for what feels like probably a day (in reality i didn't remember what happened for 3 hours but i was awake). facebook seems like it didn't update since i checked it at lunch, it was just the same news feed. my mind was projecting this. i was in the car, afraid. i didn't know how to get out, where the car was, why i was with these 3 friends, why they were smoking. i was constantly touching the car around me. i was thinking that i should roll out of the car.

i felt powerless in the car and i decided maybe if i go to sleep i'll wake up for real. i remember thinking, holy shit the mind is so powerful, being able to fabricate all of this. i can live my world so differently, it's really what i believe is true is true. i don't really remember what happens in the car, probably because i decided to take a nap.

i finally get out of the fucking car. i feel a little better now. i remember my friend asking for my address, and as i get outside of the car, i see the in-n-out that's across my house. i'm thinking, of course. this is the easiest way my mind would recognize i'm home, of course i would fabricate it. 

i start running to my house and i try to open the door without keys. it's my mind fabricating this world right? i can unlock the door with my mind. nope. i can't open the door. i'm confused as fuck at this point. i check my pockets, my keys are gone. i didn't fabricate keys in my pocket? what the fuck am i doing? goddamn it. i start peering into my house, seeing if i can see my mom. i'm thinking maybe i should run through the window. i start to get scared again. i look at the streets with the cars flying by. i start to think about the easiest way to get out of this dream world. run onto the streets and get hit by a car? drive my own car and just speed into something? fortunately, i was too scared to do either. instead i constantly ask my friends for hugs. when i hug them, i feel body warmth. at this point i'm hoping i'm in the real world, but it doesn't feel like it. i'm desperately looking for things to help convince myself that i am in the real world. i start touching my friend's hair to see if it's real. 

the door opens. my mom is there. i was thinking holy shit, my mind finally opened the door. i'm not really convinced my mom is real. i say bye to my friends who dropped me off and walk straight to my room and get on the computer. for some reason, i felt that the internet would be the only way for me communicate with the real world. i looked up bad trips on shrooms but i couldn't find anything too similar to what i was feeling. i thought about posting on reddit that i was stuck, that i needed help and asap. i thought about calling the cops that i was stuck. i was in my room but i didn't feel at home at all.

i was still thinking of ways of how i had to die so i could wake up in the real world. am i in a coma right now? on a bed in the hospital? should i starve myself to death? what's the easiest way? or should i go with a fast way like getting hit by a car? this was some inception shit. oh fuck i'm like molly. what the fuck is real.

as i'm thinking of these ways to fix everything. i'm interrupted by a phone call from my best friend. i think to myself, holy shit. finally. someone in the real world that realizes i'm gone. i choose not to pick up, because i need to figure this out by myself. i don't want to freak out anyone in the real world. if i got a phone call from my best friend telling me that he's stuck in some dream world, i would think it's a joke. i didn't want to burden anyone else in this. i fucked up, it's my responsibility to fix all of this. two missed calls from my best friend. i start to think to myself, maybe i should let my phone die, so i don't have the temptation to communicate with the real world. what if i'm in a coma for months but my phone somehow is still working, that would freak everyone out. holy shit, this is how ghost stories work. fuckkkk. maybe it's like interstellar where i have to try and communicate with the real world.

my thoughts are interrupted by knocking at the door. my mom asks me who that is, and i respond with shrug. my best friend is suddenly at the door. i think to myself holy fuck my projections are on point. he's wearing the same clothes as i last saw him, meaning my brain is just using the last available information to reconstruct him. i wasn't sure if he was real or not, but i start freaking out in front of him and my mom. i tell him that i don't know what's real and that i'm really scared. like really scared. (he later tells me that i straight up asked if we did shrooms in front of my mom, lol). they both tell me to take a shower, listen to some happy music and go to sleep. i'm thinking to myself, of course i make my projections agree with each other. i tell them okay, go into the bathroom and completely break down.

i stare into the mirror and start crying. i repeat variations of ""i fucked up"" for a minute or so. i come back out and they're standing right there, and i pretend as if nothing happened. i grab my pj's and go take a shower. i see cuts and bruises on my ribs and think maybe that me getting slammed to the ground was actually real. as i'm taking a shower, i'm still thinking of the best ways to kill myself and get out of this dream world because this is too scary. i realize that i don't have my glasses and i've been wearing my contacts this entire time. just like my keys, my glasses are missing. at the time i thought, shit, my mind is getting tired, it can't fabricate everything. i can't keep this up. i have to do something.

i get out of the shower and decide i should probably look more into shrooms and their effects (something i should've done before i agreed to even take any). my phone starts ringing again, my best friend. what? he was just here...my mom is by me, probably because she notices that something isn't right. i still think my mom is a projection at this point, so i figured i might as well ask her if i should pick up my friend's phone call. she says yes, so after two missed calls, i pick up the phone. 

i couldn't hold my shit together. i don't remember exactly what went on during the phone call but i kept apologizing to my friend. i told him i'm so sorry that i fucked up so bad. i didn't know what was real and what wasn't. he tries to assure me that everything will be fine, and that we'll play volleyball tomorrow. i then told him that i was having a terrible trip, which he tells me that saying that in itself shows what kind of grasp i have on reality. this is probably the turning point in the night where i'm like oh shit. that makes sense. we laugh a little about that.

my mom tells me that there's food, i'm reluctant to eat because starving feels like a good way to die. i decide to test my mom, i ask her for a cup of water. i walk into my room and walk back into the dining area to see if a cup of water appears. okay, maybe she is real after all. i end up eating because i was hungry and wasn't too sleepy. 

i start to think back. i was in the car with those friends, and say not with my best friend was because we all live fairly close to each other, whereas my best friend lives a little further. i didn't have my keys and glasses because they were in my bag that i left in my friends car. everything begins to make more sense. 

i begin texting all my friends who were on that trip, to see if they would respond with something genuine. even my best friend, i texted him to see if i would get responses that my mind couldn't possibly fabricate. the texts between my friends and i gave me more and more assurance that i was actually in the real world all this time. i was still confused about some things as to how i got into the car, why i was choke slammed, all cut up etc, but i figured i would ask my friends tomorrow when i see them and i had a much better grasp now that i felt okay not knowing exactly what happened. my sober friend took videos and pictures of our trip (no pun intended) and i figured that it would answer all my questions. 

i go to sleep and that's pretty much the end of it because i wake up the next day completely fine, just still a little confused.

i still haven't asked my friends about all the details, because it's a little embarrassing and my sober friend hadn't brought up the fact that i tried to touch her hair (i had just heard from my other friends). i haven't seen the videos and i still need to apologize to her. i'm so grateful and surprised that my friends didn't freak out too when i was having a really bad trip. i love my friends, even the one that choke slammed me (i was really wishing this was actually a dream). i think that the hallucinations were made worse because i was probably dehydrated (i don't recall drinking water after 5 pm until i got home, and i lost my water bottle).

at the end of the day, i just wanted to say that definitely be careful of what you're putting into your body. i'm not going to tell you how to live your life but my advice with substances is not to go too hard the first time. i'm so grateful that nothing bad actually happened that day because i realize now that we could all have fallen off a cliff and died. this experience has made me feel so much more grateful for the people around me and the things that i have. i've never been more scared in my life, not knowing what is real and what isn't. it really isn't something you can entirely explain, and something you have to experience for yourself (hopefully you won't have to).

"input: Text: so this happened about 20 min ago. i had gotten done with my quiet night of gaming and decided to take a shower before bed. as i was brining my dinner plate downstairs i noted my roommate was out and about. 

a little info: if i know my roommate is home, i will take my clothes into the shower with me and come out with at least pants on, out of courtesy for another person. if he is not home, i may or may not have boxers on, depending on how i feel. 

anyway, after drying off i open the door, and there are two girls standing outside his room, which happens to be directly adjacent to the bathroom. i was definitely not wearing pants, or boxers. aside from the brief awkwardness, i shrugged it off and walked to my room, down the hall a bit. 

i don't tend to get uncomfortable, as being in the military really prevents you from being shy. can't speak for them though, they seemed shocked for sure. 

 

edit: they're still here, so i'm hoping i didn't scare them off and my roommate can get some.

edit:i learned i should learn to be a human and put on a towel when walking out of the bathroom. but for my credit, i didn't expect anyone there!

edit: as absolutely crazy as this is gonna sound, i was not looking to hook up with either of them, because i had to get up early this morning for studying/homework, and just wanted to sleep. 

update: got a text this morning from roommate. apparently they found it hilarious, and a huge turn on. not sure what happened, as i passed out shortly after this post, but i'm assuming the best for him.

"input: Text: back in the 10th grade, i was a pretty dumbass kid. i was one of those people who were absolute nerds but were well-known throughout the whole school... that's being understated here.

it was that time where portable cd players were starting to become the norm for music, people had ridiculous clothing styles, and everything was pretty much better. popular music at that time consisted of girl group hip-hop and techno beats and love songs, one song in particular became sort of a chant within the vicinity of our school population. 

in early december a week or so before winter break was going to begin this song craze hit the school. the song at that point had hit #2 and everybody knew about it. so the faculty decided to ban the popular chorus from the song in order to try and restrict people from it, from what i heard it had to do with sexual innuedos or something.

nobody told me that they banned it.

so a few days before the break i was sitting at the nerd table and we were talking about the direction of music in the past few years. we agreed that the general quality of music was starting to go down, and i brought up the name of that song.

so the dean right by our table came up to me with a stern look on her face, wrote me a note and sent me right off to the principal's office. i got yelled at for about 20-30 minutes... it left me with a 2-day suspension. i pretty much kept my mouth shut until break began.

"input: Text: one of my goals in life is to become a responsible adult. today, i thought i'd be a responsible adult by washing and folding the huge pile of sheets, towels, and linens that have been on the basement floor ever since my boyfriend and i moved into our new place.

the first load was in the dryer and the second load was in the washing machine when i spotted [this](http://imgur.com/flvt3mq) on the floor. 

""hey, that looks like a lock of my hair,"" i thought.

only later did i realize the true implications of what i saw.

half an hour later, i'm checking the first load of sheets out in the dryer when [this]( http://imgur.com/mnoa0lz) falls on the floor. 

apparently, at some point in the forgotten past, i had cut off my (long) ponytail and decided to tuck it away as some kind of memento. which is weird and kind of gross, i know, but now things were weirder and grosser: there was a fluffy four inch freshly laundered hairball on the ground in front of me, and everything in the dryer is covered in a thin layer of my old hair. hairy sheets, hairy pillowcases, hairy dishtowels...

the lint screen was an abomination: half fuzzy, half hairy, like the untimely doom of some kind of terrible little creature. the inside of the dryer was also coated in hot, dry, staticky hair. 

 i cleaned off as much as i could. some of the sheets shook it off easily, but the terry cloth towels and flannel pillowcases are still noticeably hairy. i ran two more loads of laundry, and cleaned more hair out of the dryer each time.

i'm rewashing the hairier things tonight. hopefully that will get rid of most of it  but if it doesn't? 

am i going to have to confess to my boyfriend that his girlfriend is a weird hair-hoarding freak? or will he just get more and more confused when his socks and boxers start come out of the dryer covered in thin layers of blond hair?

fast forward to this afternoon. boss has been gone all day on a sales call (we also sell fireplaces so he was setting up an install) so i didn't have a chance to ask him. keep in mind this is a really small small business. like 6 employees. the guy i run the place with had no clue about this service plan. anyway, the customer comes in and we're discussing the lawnmower. i'm 99% sure he's going to buy so we're at my desk. he asks about the service plan and i again say i'm unfamiliar. he says it is on the manufacturer's website. the manufacturer is a company called hustler. i turn my monitor to the customer so we can both see and put www.hustler.com in the address bar. bam. brazilian chick getting railed in the pooper. awkward silence. 

i had another manufacturer's website open on another tab because i was putting in a big order when he came in so i couldn't just x out of the main window. it felt like it took an hour to find the x on the hustler tab but i finally hit it and went to the correct website, www.hustlerturf.com.

"input: Text: i was sleeping in from a really late night of studying. i had two  finals in less than 3 hours. i checked my phone and i noticed my friend sent me a snapchat of a really tiny kitten. i saw something was wrong because it was sitting in the middle of a parking lot and wasn't moving much. it looked to be about 2-3 weeks old. i knew she wouldn't do anything about it because she's not an animal person, so i had to get over there and check the situation out. 
when i got there, my heart dropped. it was frail, sickly, and all alone. it was way too young to have walked there by itself, so i'm assuming it's mother moved it. 
this is where i faced my moral dilemma. 
should i save the kitten? i really don't have time for this. i need to get to the library and cram for my final exams. i'm wasting time just by being here. 
i have rescued strays before and know it takes a lot of time and effort. this one in particular needed medical attention. 

eventually, i decided to take it with me because i knew if i left it in the parking lot, it would be run over or a hawk would eat it. the sky also looked like it was going to rain heavily as well. 

i was soo happy to have a kitten. i love kittens so much, but i don't have one due to financial reasons. but now, i have a job lined up and i'll definitely have the resources available to raise one. 

it was soo cute and when it got into my car, it seemed to perk up a bit. it meowing and crawling around. it's life didn't seem in such dire need at that point.  however, it looked like it would be old enough to walk, but it was just crawling instead. i knew it needed a vet immediately. 
i went to my computer and looked up some places. no one was answering their phone! i must have called 4 places and this is a small college town.  i was pretty upset at this point. stressing that i'm not studying and i have to take care of a young kitten. i noticed it smelled really bad. it's mother wasn't properly cleaning it, which may have caused her to leave it in the parking lot. i suspected some type of internal problem. 

i made the decision of waiting until after i was done with my finals today to start feeding it. that would be about 5-6 hours and i really thought it could make it until then. my mom has experience taking care of young kittens and bottle feeding them, so i wanted to take it to her to raise.  i was going to take it to the vet's office as soon as finished my finals.

unfortunately, by the time i got home, it was dead. 

i was so angry. i was soooo upset that the one day in the entire year that i have two final exams is also the same day that i found it. any other day, i would have been able to work around. it was the worst timing ever. i really wish i had just gone to a vet's office and left it there. i feel like such a failure and a disappointment to myself. 
i can't even enjoy my graduation at this point. all i can think about is what i should have done to save this cat's life. it was so young....

if anything, i learned some valuable lessons from this experience.

"input: Text: this actually happened today folks! context: i'm a [reasonably scary looking guy](http://imgur.com/gwo2t9w), i often get used for scaring needle elbowed old-biddies out of out way when we go shopping. i'm also an active larper (see:[/r/larp](https://www.reddit.com/r/larp/)) so have some odd stuff lying about. my gf is out of town with business so i decide to order a take-away and have a beer. nothing much else happens so i head to sleep ready for work the next day.

at about 1am i wake up and am suddenly wide awake, then i hear someone cough downstairs. i'm suddenly convinced that a) i forgot to lock the back door and b) therefore someone is in the house.

instead of acting like a sane person, i decide that, as a reasonably scary looking guy, i should grab some larp gear and scare this fucker out of my house. of the stuff that was lying about i grab a reasonably realistic looking foam axe and a ram's skull, and head downstairs to confront whoever it is and scare them the fuck out of my house.

end result, i turn on all the lights realise that i locked all the doors. i then wake up enough to remember that a) i live in an end terrace house, it was probably my neighbours and b) i'm now wondering around the house at 1am in the buff holding an axe and a ram's skull. i'm glad there's nobody actually about to see this and try to go back to sleep.

not a fu of the kind of magnitude usually seen here, but hopefully that'll entertain some people.

i work at a supermarket with an employee bathroom that makes most downtown detroit portable toilets look like the queen of england's personal bathroom in comparison. 

today i went into work with $300 cash in my pocket with the intentions of going to the casino after work with three of my buddies. around lunch time, i decided to make a trip to the bathroom. after completing the task at hand i decided instead of touching the toilet handle, that was most definitely coated in strains of bacteria that were yet to be discovered, i would use my foot to flush. as i lifted my foot up to press the handle down, my pocket decided to open wide and spill all of the bills into the forsaken bowl of no return beneath my outstretched leg.as the toilet started to flush, i plunged both hands into the filth, in hopes of retrieving some of the money.

"input: Text: so about 10 years ago i was out with my brother and met up with two incredibly beautiful women. we ended up going home with them and hooking up. no crazy foursome or anything, i went into one girls room and he went into the other. we kept in touch with both of them and i hooked up with the one a couple of times after that. turns out the girl i had hooked up with and my brother ended up hitting it off and within a month or so decided they were soulmates or whatever. he was a little bothered by the fact that i had hooked up with her but was able to see past it.
turns out, she had gotten pregnant and we weren't entirely sure who's it was as there was a week between my last hookup with her and his first. since we couldn't exactly keep it secret from family until the baby was born and we couldn't do a paternity test we just decided he would say it was his, since we figured that was most likely anyway. after he was born we secretly did the test and found out he is, in fact, mine. him and the mom got married a year later and i am very close to them so i get to be a big part of the kids life.


my son has found out about the whole 23andme thing and purchased the genetic testing kit. i had done it about a year ago when they still had the medical screening part, now that he has submitted his i'm worried what will happen if his results come up showing his father in the relatives, when my brother hasn't taken the test. does anybody know if that is a possibility? i don't really know how the kid will take it or how we could explain this to a 9 year old.

now earlier that day i overheard a couple in the elevator. they sounded obviously british. i knew their room number (hotel bill in hand). so i 'forget' logged in wifi. log in again. type their room number - 18010. it asked for surname. i type a bunch of generic british surnames i can think of. clarkson. hammond. cameron. brown. blair. adams. it was baldwin. i felt so sherlock for observing my surroundings. i use fillterbypass.me and start browsing on xvideos. i browsed through some weird weird weird stuff (for 20 minutes or so) before finding the perfect video of shazia sahari.

at breakfast next morning, i proudly tell my partner (in competition) the shit i pulled off last night. we laugh. we're in the elevator, going back to our room from the downstairs restaurant, when two cops walk in and press 18. my partner stares at me terrified. we get off on our floor (14) and make pact to never speak of it again.

i stopped it the second time with my presence and it went down the street. it traveled under one of my recycling bins and without thinking i rolled over one of it's hands and it made a loud squeal. 

lying on my front lawn, was a mole that just screamed at the top of its lungs and not moving. the cat finally comes over and sniffs the mole and leaves! i have left incriminating evidence of my assault towards a defenseless animal on my lawn and do not know what the neighbors will think of it. to quickly hide the evidence, i scooped the mole up with a shovel into a bucket and brought it to my backyard. 

the mole was disoriented for about 20 minutes and started acting lively again. it is still injured though and if i were to release it, the mole might just come back to my garden again. 

i started to look up what i could feed the mole for the time being, and realized it eats nothing but worms and larvae. i also found out, a mole cannot remain without food for 24 hours or it will die!

"input: Text: this actually happened around four years ago.

at the time i was studying on exchange in a small german coastal town. needless to say, it was a long way away from my hometown in sydney. so one day my german roommates took pity on me and decided to buy me a box of unopened (with shells) macadamia nuts to remind me of home. 

fast forward a week later and am at my desk trying to write an essay on jane austen out of all things and naturally i'm bored to tears. i've got no smokes left so i'm scanning my desk for something to do and awesome! i spot my macadamia nuts that i had forgotten about. i couldn't be bothered walking to the kitchen so smart-as fuck me decides that the best option is the pair of scissors that i have in my room. sweet! 

i grip the macadamia with my thumb and index finger and then use the scissors to hit and jab at the nut, thinking that it will cause it to break open. 

it all goes to shit when with one hit i miss the nut, and manage to not only hit the main nerves in my thumb but also break off the main tendon for my thumb as well. mayhem ensues. i can't move my index finger and thumb, i let out a bloodcurdling scream before i go into shock, german roommates rush in, are all efficient as one of them grabs ice and the other rushes me to the hospital in her car. 

this is at around 11:30pm and the doctor in the er tells me that they have to quickly do a surgery on my hand to re-tie the tendon and to repair the nerves. they call in one of their best hand doctors (wtf are they called) along with a plastic surgeon and then nonchalantly tell me that the surgery would cost 16,000 euros. lol wtf, umm. 

'do you have insurance?'

'i think my australian uni is covering my insurance during my time on exchange?'

'ok. we will call them' (side note: the doctor is hot as fuck here and i realise that i haven't shaved my legs)

'ok, our administrators called them. yes, you are covered. you will not pay anything. your surgery is at 6am tomorrow, you will sleep here.'

the next morning the surgery goes well, i vomit a shitload of anaesthesia out, and then i spend the next 6 months relearning how to use my thumb. 

the next christmas i think that i'm gifted a million nutcrackers. oh, and i totally passed that jane austen essay.

"input: Text: note: this didn't actually happen today. it occurred awhile ago before i even discovered reddit.

the date was june 11, 2013. i was in my room on the second floor of my house talking with a few of my friends. we we're discussing the different action movies we had seen since being released from school in may. 

after a good hour or so of rambling on about all of the ridiculous stunts in the movies my friend brought up a very particular, and cliched, stunt. 

this was, of course, the stunt where the hero jumps out of the window and lands on the ground without suffering injuries from the glass or the fall.

being the jokester of the group i commented that i could probably preform that stunt 'in my sleep'. to which my friend replied, ""alright then, hot wheels. how about you demonstrate it for us then?""

being also the dumbass of the group (hence why i'm here), i took him up on his offer. i got up, backed up against the wall, and ran full speed through the window. 

that's where i fucked up.

not only did i cut my arms and face on the glass, but i also fell face first onto the hood of my father's white volkswagen.

might i add that it hurt like hell.

i was taken to the hospital where i learned that i had broken my left arm and received a concussion from impacting the car. oh, and don't forget countless cuts that required stitches.

what did i learn from this? to leave stunts to the professional idiots...

...and that my father's car was covered in bird shit.

"input: Text: **backstory:** this was about three years ago and recently something brought this back to the surface of my mind. at this time i was a 21 year old male and my friend at the time was a 22 year old female who we will call 'summer'. in a very short amount of time we became extremely close and i did fall for her. after doing something very stupid to her we never spoke again. until yesterday.

**real story:**so on this particular day everything was right in the world. it was about noonish and we were supposed to go hang out and do whatever it was we did. or in this case didn't wind up doing. i went over to her house to pick her up(as planned, no surprise visit or anything) and she answered her door still in pajamas. she explained that she just got out of the shower so she still needed to put on actual clothes for going out.

okay, cool. no big deal. she gave me a hug and asked me to wait. she is a small person and was wearing a zipup hoodie 2 sizes too big for her. it wasn't exactly zipped up all the way and she's shorter than me. so inadvertently i wound up looking at her breast since she didn't have bra on. she did not notice that i saw and that's when i began my fuck up. 

instead of just taking a mental snapshot and waiting on the bed(this was a studio type of apartment) i decided it would be a great opportunity to *flirt*. i believe my words were ""huh...those are really nice."" she was a bit confused at first until she realized what i was talking about and where i was looking. she started blushing profusely and didn't look at me. she didn't say anything and just stood there really embarrassed. 

i realized that it probably wasn't a smart thing so i apologized right there on the spot. she still didn't say anything or look at me. she's always been a shy type of person and self conscious about herself. *i* in my stupidly young mind couldn't quite figure out what to do next. and then it hit me. and this is where it all went to hell.

i wanted to fix her embarrassment by embarrassing myself. my dumb idiot self thought it was a fantastic idea to drop my pants and pull down my boxers and shout ""hey look at me! it's fine summer! now you've seen me and i'm not comfortable with this either!!!"" and some other nonsense like that.

she briefly looked and all the blood drained from her face. there wasn't anymore blushing or anything like that. she just stood there white as a ghost. summer walked over to the bed and laid down in the fetal position hugging herself. i have never witnessed a sadder sight. and it was even worse to know that i was the cause of it.

i pulled my pants back up and started to call her name but she told me to stop talking. i walked towards her and it was told ""don't"". so i did exactly that and froze in my tracks. i really didn't know what to do at this point. i thought it was supposed to be kinda funny and at the most just get slapped. i apologized some more and asked her if she wanted me to leave. she was still laying there and began to cry. summer never looked at me and she stopped answering. i took that as an understandably sign to get the fuck out of her house.

the next day i tried to call but she didn't answer. i texted her apologies using as many synonyms for the word that i could find in a thesaurus. i tried a few more times over the course of a few weeks and one day she did say that it was ""okay"". even still we never hung out or spoke again after that.

i never regretted a moment in my life and much as that one. i not only lost what i felt was my best friend but i did it by making her cry. i disgusted her beyond belief and i can't even fathom what the hell made me think that was a good idea in the first place. it wasn't funny as i was expecting and instead was just depressing. i was the cause of it.

"input: Text: quick background: i've had insomnia issues for years and went the prescription route about six months ago. tried a thousand options, all unsuccessfully, and finally struck gold with ambien. i take 10mg pretty much every night - total godsend. recently started dating a new guy. he's great, i'm infatuated, and i'm doing everything in my power to not fuck it up.


as most of you probably know, the ambien walrus is very real. if you don't go to bed within 20-30 minutes, you'll probably start seeing and doing weird shit. most nights i'm asleep in minutes, but i've never had insane hallucinations or blacked out and done something ridiculous. i've watched pillows growl like lions, picture frames morph into dragons, and towels turn into the couple from american gothic. the worst thing thus far was waking up to an order confirmation from amazon prime for 24 boxes of sugar-free jello.


well, that is until 3:30 am today. last night was our second adult sleepover. around 3, he's sound asleep and starting to snore a little while i'm lying there under his cuddle trap, bug-eyed and wide awake. i'd had a long week and the idea of a sleepless night isn't too appealing, so i grab one from my purse, swallow the fucker, and crawl back into bed. we didn't have much to drink earlier and the ambien walrus rarely hangs out with me, so i wasn't worried about anything.


about 15 minutes later, the bf wakes up and starts initiating sex, and i'm very down. he's hot, sex is fun, and let's just say 2015 was the most celibate year of my adult life. everything's going great - a little making out, a little foreplay, the p goes in the v, everyone's happy. important to note: we aren't doing anything remotely freaky. very enjoyable, but very vanilla.


at this point, it's right around the 30 minute mark and just in time, the walrus pulls a michael jordan and comes out of retirement. the bf's been on top for a few minutes when i suddenly recoil a little. out of nowhere i scream, ""oh my god stop. can't we just have sex normally?!"" he pulls off and says, ""i'm sorry, of course...but what do you mean? did i do something wrong?"" 


i was 100% convinced that we were having sex on stage at the democratic national convention while hillary clinton was delivering a speech. i thought his bed was next to the podium, and hil was narrating our every move and explaining how real sex, aka not porn sex, works as part of some sex ed thing. he's howling laughing, can barely breathe, rolls off of me and tells me that sure, we can leave, we'll just go to sleep and have some normal sex later.


i wake up at 9-ish and as a huge fan of morning nookie, i'm all over him. right as he's about to stick his dick in me, he smirks and goes, ""oh i'm sorry, is this normal enough for you?"" i don't have a fucking clue what he's talking about. he starts cracking up and explains the entire thing, which i had zero recollection of (though it's been coming back to me today). i don't think i've ever been more embarrassed or turned a brighter shade of red in my life.


the bad news is, i don't think i can take ambien again. ever. i want to flush my remaining supply down the toilet and tell my doctor to cancel my refills and get me on something new. the good news is, this guy must be quite fond of me, because i'm pretty sure yelling that you don't want to fuck on stage at the democratic national convention would be a dealbreaker for most people. ^don't^worry^we^still^boned^after


oh, and i'm not even a democrat. and i really don't like hillary clinton.

"input: Text: this happened an hour ago. at around 8:50pm i realised i didn't get my paychecks yet, so i asked one of the employees, australian by the way, to get them. she came back and gave me $400 worth. 

here's where the f.u. happened. i loosely tucked the paychecks into a sleeve in my apron (i work as a courtesy clerk) and went on the rest of my shift. apparently, i was so zoned out that i didn't notice that all the paychecks, at some point, just fell out of the sleeve. i clocked out at 9:15, folded up my apron, and ran home (i don't own a car). it wasn't until i settled down at home 30 minutes later that i finally realised the checks were gone.

i panicked like crazy, dropping lots of sweat and mumbling in a very worrying tone. i decided to go back to the store through the fastest way possible: my little brother's bike. upon arriving, i asked all the employees if they saw anything; each said no. the head clerk then said to wait until tomorrow to tell the manager what happened, and he will be able to reprint the checks. i got home another 20 minutes later disappointed but relieved. all my mother had to say was, ""well, i hope you learned a very important lesson in responsibility.""

let's see what happens tomorrow.

*not a big f.u., but it's one that made me very flustered.*

**edit 1:** i finally called up the manager at around 8:00 today, as the head clerk told me. after 10 minutes of being on hold listening to some ambient jungle music, the manager picked up. i told him what happened. and the first thing he said was, ""i'm not the one in charge of checks."" he then said i had to call up another department if i ever had this problem, but they're closed on the weekends. so now, i'll have to wait until monday to get the checks renewed. fml?

"input: Text: so thursday i was taking a test for my english class. now this test was an interesting one because of what it was over. the test was on an outside of class reading book, basically we had to do a short answer writing assignments for a test grade. i read catch-22 which is a great novel, i highly recommend it. however, despite my normally being a good student, i am struggling in this class. the teacher hates me and thinks i am a slacker who doesn't try because i have accommodations. i have some adhd and dislexia so i get a few little aids like time and a half on tests and the ability to type my papers instead of hand writing them. this doesn't give me an excuse, in fact i have to work harder than others to reach my full potential. 

so, there i am the morning of the test an i am freaking out. i'm under a lot of pressure because i am trying to get my grade up in that class to get an academic scholarship. since i'm nervous i decide to cram using sparknotes and wikipedia. unfortunately, i got distracted and moved to another tab without closing the wiki links. now when i went to type my test those tabs were still open but i opened my word processor from a reddit tab and didn't notice. i type my test and everything is going swimmingly, until my teacher decided to monitor my chrome book i was typing on. it is the schools chromebook so there is a program that my teacher can access a listing of what tabs i have open. now those tabs of wikipedia and sparknotes are still open and my teacher sees those. boom  instant failure. written up for cheating. in school suspension. 0 on the test. no exam exemptions.  this has screwed my chances of getting into my dream college and i will lose my scholarships at my safety school. i fucked up boys, and i don't know what to do.

"input: Text: so it was summer vacation and my friend and i were staying at another friend's house while he was in new york for the summer. his parents owned the place and were relatively wealthy. they also worked in lived and worked in holland at the time. when my friend and i moved into his house he mentioned that we could have any of the alcohol that he left behind. throughout the summer went went through quite a few bottles of vodka, rum etc. we had a good time. 

one day, whilst snooping around we found a hidden cabinet in the bathroom way up high. after standing on a chair, i found a few bottles of bright green alcohol. there was a grey goose bottle, a sapphire bottle, and various others all filled with this same green. 

our immediate thought:  omg... absinthe (at least the hard stuff with real wormwood) is illegal in the us. these guys live in holland. it's hidden away. it's in different bottles so it won't be suspicious. holy shit we just found a shit ton of absinthe. 

we spent the next hour or so debating what to do. do we drink it? as people who don't do any drugs, we were pretty nervous about the potential hallucinations we might have... but eventually we gave in and thought we'd drink some. 

we each took a shot. we waited. ""do you feel anything yet?"" was a constant question we asked. 

we took a few more shots. after all, one shot isn't gonna do anything. after about six shots a piece we became skeptical. we finally gave in and texted our friend to ask about the absinthe in his cabinet... who knows... maybe we were drinking it wrong. 

he said we'd have to specify about the bottle so we sent him this picture:

he responded, and it turns out that we had been taking shots of highlighter ink that he would display under backlights for backlight parties.
we freaked out obviously and called poison control. they basically told us to piss a lot and not sleep till we thought it was out of our systems.

so my family decided to holiday on the remote scottish island of uist a few years ago.
my dad and i were having a play fight (as you do) and i pushed him onto the arm of a rigid leather sofa and then proceeded to body slam him with all my weight.
what followed was the crack of 2 of his ribs breaking (i felt it travel through my body, like when someone farts on the couch next to you and you can feel it vibrating).
my poor dad then fell to the floor gasping for breath as i stood speechless, looking down at him in horror.
it was at this moment that my brother (who hadn't heard/felt the bones break) mistook my dads gasping for laughing and jumped on his head.

just to make matters worse he's a doctor so he didn't think he should be bothering emergency services with something he could treat himself.
all night i could hear him groaning and gasping in pain and i've never felt so bad in my life though i'm fairly sure he felt worse.

"input: Text: i wouldn't really say it's much of a fuck up since i never see people do this but i still consider it to be a normal. least that's what my parents taught me. first post on reddit btw.

i was going home on the 6 train in nyc headed towrds pelham bay and i get on the train and find a nice seat. a few stops later i notice a bunch of somewhat old people getting on the train. they weren't handicapped nor had a cain or any disabilities from what i first noticed. 

a lady, i'd say around 60 years old entered the train with a pully bag (idk the proper name), she looked around and just stood near the door. i didn't think anything of it. i finished eating my lunch (a samosa chaat, if you were curious) and just closed my eyes listening to lindsey stirling. 

a few stops later i looked to see what stop the train was on and the same lady was standing in the same spot. the lady was looking around the train and her eyes were red and she looked like she was crying a little. she was shaking a little but i didn't think much of it.

after a few stops, the train was much more crowded now with little room. the train stopped on 110th. someone got off and the lady was on her way there but some asshole rushed passed her and sat down. she looked hurt and disappointed. i began thinking what should i do. i mean i knew i should have immediately offered my seat but i didn't. i didn't know why either. the lady now was tearing up. 

the train cleared up a little and i finally noticed her knees shaking a little. i then immediately got up and gave her my seat and she said thank you. i feel like i should have noticed it much earlier. normally i'm much more observant but waking up at 5:30 in the morning to get to an 8am class is tiring but it's no excuse for my fuck up. i got off the train at parkchester which is like maybe a 40 minute ride from where the lady originally got on and she was still on the train. i guess she was headed further uptown. but regardless, i don't know if this qualifies for a tifu but it just left me with a nasty feeling knowing i could have offered myself earlier. just felt like a fuck up to me.

"input: Text: so this happened about a year ago when i was working at a creamery that made cheese and ice cream. now i don't want to say the name of the company but they sell cheddar throughout the u.s.

so i worked graveyard which was just 4 guys. 2 guys making the cheese and 2 guys cleaning and no supervisor . there was 1 guy running the cooking vats and one guy running the whey and milk presses and we'd switch every couple hours


now we have very strict time schedules that we try to adhere to and when it was my turn on the vats i noticed we were about a minute or so behind. so i remembered in my training that if we were that far behind we could speed up the pumps that pump the cheese curd into the cheddaring machine. so i sped the pump up from about 30 percent to about 70 percent for 1 vat and set it back. made up the time loss and then some so i was happy with what i had done.

fast forward to about an hour later i was coming back from break and saw the guys running around in a panic. apparently the cheese that got pumped out faster all got clogged up about halfway through the cheddaring machine. nobody noticed until about 2 more vats worth of cheese had also been pumped behind it.

so we had to call in the boss and wake him up to come down while we stopped production and tried to manually cut the cheese out of the machine through little windows. 

because of the stop in production we had to pasteurize( instead of heat shock as we normally would) about 4 vats worth of cheese which makes it a lot less valuable. plus we were unable to make as much cheese throughout the day, putting the estimated loss at around $100,000.

luckily i didn't get in any trouble since my trainer had taught me to speed it up( although i sped it up a lot higher than i should've)

we had a pratical lesson in chemistry today (yay), and it involved doing something called 'cracking hydrocarbons'. we basically had to heat up parrafin in a boiling tube (a large test tube) and collect the gas over water, which looks a bit [like this](http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/3311/3391331/imag1006/aaauayg0.jpg). somehow the water ended up in the boiling tube (i don't know either), which was *really* hot, and ended up cracking it.

"input: Text: i went to bed around 11 pm, as i usually do on most work nights. i woke up around 2 am, craving a honey bun, i didn't think anything of it, i do this most nights. i navigated through my apartment in the dark to find my magical snack. i eventually found myself in the kitchen groping through the dark to find my sugary treat. during my *groping*, i accidentally knocked a knife off the counter, which landed in my foot.

i looked down at my foot in shock, i couldn't believe a knife had the audacity to interrupt my honey bun time. luckily the knife bounced out after it landed sharp end down on my foot. the next logical step was to find my honey bun and proceed to the toilet (since i also had to pee). while eating my honey bun and staring at my bleeding foot, i came up with what i believe to be a brilliant idea, at the time. i decided to put two socks on my damaged foot, to help stop the bleeding, i recognized the importance that two socks on one foot would provide absorbency and pressure. after applying the two socks, i finished eating and peeing, and went back to sleep.

"input: Text: my father in law has been over at the house lately helping me with a little project in the backyard. we realized today that we needed a couple of bolts and washers from lowes to complete the project, so we decided to take my car and head over there so that we could wrap up the job.

as we are walking to my car my father in law starts to ask me if i have sirius satellite radio hooked up. he's thinking about getting it activated in his car since his trial ran out so he's questioning me on what channels i listen to. i tell him about bbc radio (he's originally from the uk) and he's quite excited to hear that its a channel option. i listen to bbc radio all the time so the channel is pretty much permanently on. 

so we hop into my car and i start it and begin to back out of the garage. i have a newer volkswagen so the stereo has a large push button screen that allows you to select radio stations. the radio station screen with all the stations listed disappears when you put the car into reverse because the image from the reverse camera then takes over the display.

just as we are backing out of the garage i hear the words '...birth control' over the radio, but somewhat quiet. i proceed to turn up the volume because i assume that the radio is still tuned to the bbc and they are talking about some new pubic healthcare issue or some such thing. 
the next words i hear just after i turn up the radio, and much louder this time, is:

'aaaahhh...i just shot a huge load into your pu**y'

what the hell!?

i frantically try to switch the radio station but the god damned backup camera is on the screen showing where i am going, and it won't allow me to change the radio stations! im trying to act casual here, but its pretty clear at this point that my father in law heard what was going on and can see that i am frantically trying to change the station. then comes the next words from the radio..

<fart noise> 'oh yeah baby push it out of there! i love that sound. fart my cum right out of your pu**y'

fml... is this for real?

finally i remember there is a 'band' button physically on front of the radio so that i can switch between am/fm and i start pushing the damned thing fast. finally the f*cking porno sounds end and some song comes up.

i've stopped the car half way out of my driveway at this point because i have put so much attention on this damned radio. i can't believe i panicked so much that i didn't just hit the stupid power button or band button earlier. what the hell was i thinking?

a few seconds of silence pass and then my father in law finally says 'what exactly did we need again? some bolts and washers right?' 
a nice attempt on his part, but i was as red as a tomato at this point and my shame was everywhere. we drove the rest of the way in relative silence, minus the bbc radio that i was finally able to put on. 

what happened you ask? well my stupid fucking radio has a bluetooth function which allows you to stream audio from your phone over the speakers. its nice because you can listen to your music/audiobooks/whatever from your phone over the car speakers. 

well the last time i had gotten out of the car the radio was set to this bluetooth mode because i had been listening to an audiobook on the way home from work. well shortly after i had gotten home from work that night, i decided to check out pornhub on my phone and watch a few 'tasteful' videos.

because the porn video was the last thing that i had looked at on my phone before i had gotten into the car, the sound from that porn was broadcast through my car speakers as soon as the car turned on. turning on the car essentially unpaused that fucking video and proceeded to play the rest of the audio through my car speakers. 

we finished the job and my father in law pretended like it never happened. i appreciate that. but this will always go down as one of the worst things that has ever happened to me.

"input: Text: like most tifu's, this did not occur today.

in a former life i was a nightclub manager in the heart of sydney. locals will know it as the infamous 'lockout' district. i dealt with the local police on an almost nightly basis and was on a first name basis with most of the licensing unit (the cops assigned to bars and clubs specifically).

on this fateful monday venue management is having our weekly catch up with marketing. marketing lets us know they have booked an event aimed at gay middle eastern men. cool, new crowd, new revenue stream and it fills a big hole in the event calendar.

marketing does let us know that the guy running this event (commonly called a promoter) is experienced, professional but personality wise is somewhat erratic and prone to over-reacting to small things. not a problem, we've dealt with far worse.

so wednesday rolls around and marketing texts me that there's an issue: threats have been made against this event. the promoter is really worried - apparently he's pretty sure he knows who issued the threats (but has no proof) and is concerned for the safety of staff and the patrons.

his prediction is the the person making the threats will send in a 3rd party, unknown to anyone there, who will play nice with security to get in the door and only cause trouble once the event is in full swing. big fucking knives on a crowded, dark, loud dance floor kind of trouble.

so i contact local police and let them know the situation. given we only have vague threats and no proof at this point we ask for a uniformed presence to be in the area to deter any troublemakers, as well as be nearby if the shit does hit the fan.

7.30 friday rolls around, doors open at 8. as i'm setting up the door i notice not only a uniformed presence, but groups of 4-5 police every 200 meters or so, just roaming the street. seems like overkill for one potential troublemaker, but it's not uncommon to see a lot of uniforms out if there's a footy game or festival or other  big event with a large number of people heading into town after to kick on.

it's at this point i personally meet the promoter for the first time. he's not 'slightly erratic' as marketing warned, he's a fucking jittery whirlwind who talks a mile a minute and squirrel is very easily squirrel distracted. we shake hands, chat about the plans for the night and i give him a final run down of a few house rules and legal requirements we have to abide by.

it's at this point the aforementioned licensing cops roll up, which is good timing because i was about to go over the threats made and their exact nature with the jittery whirlwind. so i introduce him to officers 1, 2 and 3 and ask him to go over exactly what's been said by who.

he begins by saying the threats were made on facebook and he has screenshots. he pulls out his tablet to show us.

>see here, here and here? i don't know this guy but the profile picture is someone else i know and he's been all over the event page telling me he's going to get it shut down. that's a threat. we've been threatened. i'm really worried about this, i don't want anyone getting stabbed by this psycho or his hit-men.

we all just stop and stare. you see, this kind of shit is really, really common. it's usually a rival event or promoter trying to sabotage their competition. the oldest, dirtiest trick in the book is to call the cops, tell them the headlining dj or band is a drug dealer or carrying a gun or whatever. said entertainer gets detained, sometimes for an extended period, which essentially kills the event. officer 1 looks me in the eye. officer 2 is dumbfounded. officer 3 breaks the silence.

>you're telling me this is all over some facebook bullshit? we've pulled in officers from other parts of town for this!

it's then that i realize all those cops i saw aren't out for a footy game or a festival crowd, they're out because this crazy son of a bitch said his *gay middle eastern* event had received threats. post 9/11. and because i was a known entity to local police and they know i'm not a fucking idiot they took it fairly seriously.

officer 1 looks me in the eye again and motions me to one side to speak privately. as i'm walking off i hear officers 2 and 3 berating this idiot for wasting their time.

i *immediately* begin apologizing. i had no idea. he said there were knives and hit-men involved. he never told me, or marketing, that this was facebook bullshit. he just said they'd been threatened.

officer 1 shakes his head, takes a few steps away and gets on his radio. within 20 minutes there's not a cop to be seen.

i find out the following week, via a phone call from the venues owner, who was on holiday and none too pleased to be dealing with this bullshit, that my call had in fact met the criteria for a low level terror alert, and in the future i'd better be real fucking sure i do my due diligence and investigate any 'threats' made before calling the police.

"input: Text: &nbsp;  
(like all tifus, t=""that time when"" not ""today."")  back in the late 80s, i was a repair tech for a computer manufacturer.  a lot of maintenance had to be done in the wee hours because i worked on production systems that ran entire businesses.  i had to upgrade a system, but wasn't allowed to take it offline until 3am.  i got to the data center around midnight, though.  so i was pretty bored.  at the time, computers were huge, and most were encased in large fridge-sized (or bigger) enclosures.  ""skins,"" we called them.  today everything is in standard 19"" rack enclosures.  
so to amuse myself and pass the time, i went around the data center and peered into other systems.  many of them had a sort of lever-style handle that opened them up, so when i came to a really large handle on a system that was set up against the wall, i didn't really pay attention to anything else.  
i pulled the lever, thinking it would open and i'd see whatever was inside.  nope.  it turned off all the things.  the data center went dark.  the emergency lighting came on.  and i heard the sound of hundreds of fans, disk drives, high-speed printers, tape drives, etc. whirring down all at once.  it was like that scene in star wars where obi wan kenobi powers down the death star's tractor beams.  
peering up in the dim emergency lighting, i read the words ""ups power cut off"" (or something like).  a ups is an uninterruptible power supply.  it keeps power going to a system or a place in the event of a blackout.  in a data center, they sometimes use really big ones, with the temporary power provided by of lead/acid batteries.  lots and lots of 'em.  i realized had just cut power to the entire data center.  
i can only describe the sensation i felt by saying that it was like someone had replaced all the blood in my body with liquid nitrogen.  i couldn't breathe.  my vision narrowed until i could only see a small spot in front of me.  i was screwed.  
i tried pulling the handle/lever back to its original position, but only a few systems started coming up.  in my panic, i thought maybe another power cycle would help.  so i threw the switch off again, then back on.  even fewer systems booted up.  so i did it again.  and again.  and then finally the ups wouldn't provide power anymore, and i smelled burning insulation somewhere in one of the battery enclosures.  double screwed.  
being a basically good person and wanting to take responsibility, i immediately phoned my customer contact and confessed what i had done.  except not really.  
instead, i got out a flashlight from my tool kit and went all over the data center wiping my fingerprints from every handle.  and then i called my customer contact and said ""the data center just went dark.  i smell burnt insulation.  you probably need to get an electrician in here.""  he paged a guy, who came out, looked into the ups, found a fried wire, and said ""here's the culprit!""  he fixed the problem, powered back up the data center, and then the rest of the evening other repair techs and administrators for all the other systems came in to boot up and get things running.  i quietly did my hardware upgrade and left.  
the next morning, my boss asked me to step into his office.  he said that the customer had called him because he wanted to formally thank our company for reporting the power problem, and that if i hadn't shown up for my work early they would have never gotten back online for the next business day.  he handed me a $50 gift certificate to a swanky restaurant and told me to take my wife out for dinner.  i have tifu'd many other times in my career, but that was the biggest one that i got away with and the only time i failed to fess up.  what can i say?  i was young, scared, and it was my first ""real"" job.  lesson learned.

"input: Text: for this christmas i came up with the great idea of getting a weighted set of clothes for christmas. my logic behind it was, i could wear the clothes and get slowly used to them so when i take them off i move slightly faster than if i hadn't used them. so i requested to my parents to get me them.

they actually went and got me a weighted vest. i was pretty pleased. throughout the christmas holidays, i've resolved to doing the abdominal plank position for half an hour twice a day; so combined with the weighted vest i've improved my fitness somewhat.

i came up with the idea of wearing the weighted vest to sleep so i could get used to it more easily. yeah, not a great idea. i put it on over the top of my pajamas and went to sleep. i woke up in the middle of the night in horrendous pain and ripped off the weighted clothes, a portion of my chest felt like i had a small spike ball wedged deep inside. for that night and the next several nights it took my three hours to get to sleep. three. frigging. hours.

so the next few days i woke up and thanks to my near crippling ocd did my usual abdominal plank for half an hour and nearly collapsed from the pain afterwards, for the rest of the day i had to walk around looking like the hunchback of notredame to relieve my pain. after about four days i gave in and went to the doctor where i got informed that i've pulled a muscle in between my ribs and have been put on ibuprofen for two weeks.

"input: Text: as with alot of these on here, this occurred **not** today, but rather about 3 years ago. also, this is my first post on tifu. i've always lurked and had alot of laughs at some of the epic fu's i've read, but never contributed or even signed up. i found myself remembering this incident we're about to dive into, and the absurdity of it. i figured it would be worthy material to share here. i get a kick out of looking back on it, and i figure some other folks will get a kick out of my eloquently written account of it


now that we've got that out of the way, strap in and please keep all hands and feet inside the ride until it has come to a complete stop. follow me as i set the scene.


**year:** 2012.
 
**location** a modest sized house with a group of inebriated individuals, located in a quiet suburb in the us. *(boy, that sounds like a recipe for disaster already)*

**time**: somewhere in the late night hours of 1am-2am.


let's preface by backtracking a few hours from when things *(quite literally)* came crashing down.


it was a frosty, cold night. winter was in full swing. the chill of the midnight air nipped at my face as i stepped out of the car, beers in hand and a cigarette hanging from my lips. it was dead quiet, except for the occasional car that passed by on the nearby main road, and the closing of our car doors. i had just arrived at the house-in-question with a couple friends and i was freezing. for this story, we'll call those friends charlie and william. 


we had just come from a concert and decided to keep the night going by stopping in at a party. the host was one of our friends and invited us over to join the festivities. i was still slightly buzzed from the overpriced concert beers and i didn't want to end the night just yet. so of course, i was on board to accept the host's invitation to invade his home, enjoy beer that didn't cost a fortune, and make an ass of myself in front of my friends. 


we stroll in through the front door. we're greeted by friends who are sitting around the coffee table in the living room. people are coming and going throughout the house. the air is filled with cigarette smoke, laughter, conversations and music. it's a typical house party. i shed my coat, winter hat, and gloves and then proceed to make my way to the kitchen to stash my beer.


i've partied at this house before and i swear this place has it in for me. the last time i was here, i tripped over a guitar amp in the living room and ended up being the proverbial tree that fell in the forest. the only difference is that everybody was around and everybody heard it. and everybody gave a shit. charlie, william and i made a reference to that incident on this night, but little did we know, it would serve as irony later on. 


fast forward. we're all wandering throughout the house and socializing with friends and other party goers. i'm downing beers and having a great time. i end up in the kitchen and start chatting up this cute girl, who we'll refer to as *""kitchen girl.""* we're getting on pretty well, flirting, and at some point, we had some close physical contact going. arms around each other and that sort of thing. everything's going smooth - even sidestepping a cockblock attempt from a lesbian who had taken a vehement interest in the girl as well.


at some point, in my drunken brilliance, i decide to start circle headbanging - or *""windmilling""* - in the kitchen in front of kitchen girl. yes, full blown windmills, as if i were on stage with cannibal corpse. i don't even remember what spurred that shenanigan or how, but i'm pretty sure it had something to do with our conversation at that moment. all i know is that i had copious amounts of alcohol coursing through my veins; and that is not a good thing when coupled with rapid, disorienting motions such as circle headbanging. it seemed like a good idea at the time. but as dave mustaine once sang - *""hindsight is always 20/20. looking back, it's still a bit fuzzy.""* the irony of that last line is so true, in light of the events to come.


**target in sight and lit**

when i brought my head up from my short cannibal corpse moment, the room started spinning. i'm nowhere in proximity of anything that i can grasp onto, in order to maintain my balance. i fear if i take a step forward to find something, i'll come crashing down. i figured i'll just stand still and wait for my heavy metal carousel to come to a complete stop, before i even think about making a move.


**we have tone. prepare to fire**

it's not working. my equilibrium is now fucked and i feel myself starting to sway. i'm trying to fight it, but vertigo has completely taken hold of me and has other ideas. my body starts shifting and my legs start moving. i knew what was coming.......damn you, physics.


**fox two! missile away!**

i stumble. i reach out preemptively so i can catch myself if i go down. i stumble again. the stumbling turns into a shuffling run. *(the stumble-run that you inadvertently do when you lose your balance and try to catch yourself.)* my feet are stomping towards the other side of the room as inertia takes hold and puts my hunched over body into motion. as i'm picking up speed, i'm trying to regain control of this ill-fated course, but there was no coming back. i'm like bambi on ice being pulled in by the death star tractor beam. i start getting wobbly, and i go careening headfirst across the kitchen like a fucking laser guided missile, homing in towards the cabinet on the other side of the room. oh no....oh no.....


**splash! good effect on target**

**wham!** i found my mark and slammed headfirst into the cabinet with a loud **thunk**, followed by the sound of scattering beer cans as i collapsed on the floor. the whole room went silent and all attention was immediately diverted in my direction upon impact. i was still conscious but it took me a couple seconds to realize what the fuck just happened. and there i was. on the floor, holding my head and muttering profanities while laying in a pile of empty beer cans that had spilled out of their nearby boxes and bags when i came crashing down. what a buffoon! i just had to be that guy, didn't i? charlie comes over to see if i'm ok and helps me to my feet. i'm deemed good-to-go, no signs of concussion or anything. as i'm rubbing my head, i can't help but laugh about the whole thing and i go right back to drinking and socializing. all those beers dulled my sense of pain, but i knew this was gonna hurt worse in the morning. 


at this point, kitchen girl disappeared and i don't think i saw her again for the rest of the night. the lesbian probably stole her away after i did my glorious charade of a human missile in the kitchen. oh well. i ended up leaving the party shortly afterwards and got dropped off at home.

 
i woke up the next day with a knot on my head and a headache to go with it. i started piecing together the events in my head and everything came back to me. needless to say, my buddies didn't let me live down the whole ordeal for a couple days. i made a mental note to bring a helmet next time i go to that house.

"input: Text: so ultra tickets just went on sale today and just like anyone else i was pumped. 6 friends and i all wait patiently as we wait for our turns to buy the tickets. we all signed up for pre-registration so we can by tier1 or tier 2 tickets which were $300 and $380 respectively. pre-registration had promo codes that allowed you to buy tier 1 or tier 2 tickets as soon as tickets go on sale. people who didn't sign up don't gain access to tier 1 or tier 2 so they have to by tier 3 which cost $450. my wait in line was 7 minutes so the anticipation was killing me. 1 of my friends manage to get through and bought 2 tier 1, we were so pumped for him. finally it was my turn to buy tickets, i put my code in and manage to buy 4 tickets. filled out all my credit card info and boom tickets purchased. only a second later i saw the price of the tickets which were tier 3. so do the math $450 x 4 plus tax and shipping cost totaling to $1814.75....fuck. soon after my mistake another one of my friends got 2 tier 1 tickets. so if you are keeping track that's 8 tickets for seven people. so yeah my dumb ass didn't realize my mistake and now i'm stuck with not only tier 3 tickets, but one extra one. i just emailed ultramusicfestival.com to see if i can get a refund for one of the tickets, lets just hope i can.

"input: Text: i've been living in an apartment building near my university for the past 7 months or so. i live with 3 other guys, two of whom i did not know prior to move in. they're both really nice asian guys who are close friends, but neither speaks very much english so our interactions are limited. we obviously introduced ourselves by name the day i moved in, but, being the careless 20 year old guy that i am, i decided the typical ""bro"", ""man"", and ""dude"" greetings would suffice and didn't bother to make a note of them.

the four of us share a mailbox. knowing i had a package arriving, i ran downstairs and grabbed it along with the rest of the mail. here's where i fucked up: rather than leaving the mail on the counter like i usually do, i figured i'd be a nice guy and personally deliver it to the roommates. first up: a small package for jung-ho feng. 

one of my asian roommates (who i was certain was jung-ho) was sitting at the kitchen table so i approached him and said with a smile ""hey i think i've got some mail for you!"" he stared at the package for a moment and said ""this...this isn't for me."" rather than stopping there and preserving what little dignity i had left, i stupidly responded ""woops, my bad! well could you give it to your friend for me then?"" he gave me a confused look and said ""this isn't his either..."" shocked and embarrassed, i mustered a simple ""oh"" and walked back to my room with my head hung in shame.

i left my empty pee cup on the counter and went to my car to get my phone i had left in the glove compartment. when i came back my friend was sipping on a tall rum and coke- straight from my empty piss cup.

"input: Text: so today my plans consisted of; going to work, getting off of work, feeling sorry for myself because i won't be watching star wars. as it turns out, my boss caught the flu over night and could not get his heads-up text that he was going to give me the day off because my phone is out of service as of last night. i don't yet have a car, so i had to call using my boss's phone for a ride. my roommate was a bit annoyed, but luckily decided to come back to pick me up, it's cold out. 

he decides that he'll go swing by the gym and drop me off at the mall for a few hours, then we would meet at a set time and head back home. i told him that if i don't show up in five minutes, he can head back home and i'd just walk. seemed like a plan. so now i'm at the mall, trying out some fancy clothing at sears and just wandering around. it had been some time i've been to hot topic, so i decided ""eh, why the hell not?""

i walk in, and immediately i'm met by a cute girl with blonde hair and pink coloring at the ends, black rimmed glasses, and large sweater for her small size. she informs me of some buy-one-get-half-off sale going on and before we know it, we're both chatting about all sorts of random stuff. she seemed cool and nice. she was only a year younger than me too. we talk for a good twenty or so minutes.

i gather what music she likes, she enjoys doctor who, etc. said she watched a movie while at the mall all day yesterday, creed apparently. she's also from texas like me, so we both hate the cold weather that has been going on lately. 

so eventually i decide to browse around and see if i could find anything, and have her continue working in case she'll get into trouble. nothing seems to interest me much and i happen to glance at my phone, i notice i'm only two minutes away from the set time my roommate is going to pick me up. i need to haul ass. 

as i'm heading out, the girl is giving me a goodbye. i decide, ""you know what? recently single. how's about i ask her to watch a movie with me? she definitely seems into me, and i feel confident enough.""

so i say ""i need to head out in a hurry, buuuut let me ask you; did you watch your movie yesterday alone?""

she said yes. ah, good!

""welllll, how's about we go watch a movie later?"" i say in a suggesting tone and funny arm gestures. she says she's working right now and i said, chuckling, ""obviously not now, i need to head out as well!""

she looks at me in a 'sorry' expression. oh dick, i'm getting rejected...

""oh, shit, sorry, is it kinda odd for a stranger you just met to be asking you out?""

""yeeeeah..."" she says with the same look. 

alright, now i got two reasons to get the hell out of here. 

""shit then, really sorry about that- gotta' go though, i'll catch you later!"" and so i speed walk my way out of the mall, i haul ass to the meeting spot, and i just barely caught up with my roommate. we talk about bidets all the way home. i get on reddit to tell you my tifu story, and now i'm done typing said tifu story. 

and today i shall now feel sorry for not watching star wars *and* for being rejected, *and* for having had been recently dumped. fuck you, holidays.

so this auction comes along with a ton of electronics, and a surprisingly large amount of broken phones, laptops and tablets. tons of working stuff too, but definitely lots of broken stuff. there were 8 ps4's posted. the current bid was 225, and i decided i would try to bid up. i submit $250, but was outbid automatically. so i just went ahead a clicked the button again, for some reason thinking it would stay at $250. i close chrome and go on my day. 

the next morning i realize that i really didn't need the thing, nor really want it. this is when i realized i had bid $300, not 250 or 275. i saw the other ps4s sold for 250, that's when i realized i wouldn't be outbid, and one course the one that sold for more? mine. 

i get to the auction place, pay for the thing, after taxes and fees came to $400. the box was torn up, but everything was there. took it home and what do you know? broken. it turned on but the blu ray drive doesn't work. i'm in talks with sony currently. why did i even bid.

"input: Text: i've been pretty bored lately, and have been going through a bit of a dry spell. these two things combined are my excuse for what i've been doing the past few weeks. i've been shaving half my pubes. to the right of the dick, baby smooth. the left, a good bit of fuzz. yeah, stupid. i know. boredom does things to a man.

with that said, my real story starts with a group of my friends. i've been busy with work, but have finally been graced with a night off and an invitation to a little gathering. thank fuck.

what i didn't expect was for my crush to be there. she's in the same circle of friends, so it isn't exactly rare to see her, but i wasn't really informed. we're not strangers, either. we fool around occasionally, but things never really progress much further. tonight, it was a bit different.

after a while of all of us shooting the shit, someone mentions going on a food and beer run. some of my friends are some seriously picky eaters, and after a bout of arguing, everyone who wanted food just decided to go. you can see where this is heading.

it didn't take long for us to get into it. things were much more... heated this time around. clothes were falling off. she looks down at my junk, and like in most men's worst nightmare, start cracking the fuck up. my immediate reaction was to get angry. then it hit me. i'd completely forgotten that i've only been mowing half the lawn.

things stopped after this. immediately. our clothes went back on, and when she was finally able to catch her breath she gave me a ""maybe next time.""

"input: Text: so i'm a member of the scouts as are lots of my friends who i've known for years. usually once a year we go on a week long camp to the middle of nowhere and while yeah it can be crap it's mainly enjoyable.

this time it was not, it rained the entire week and since we were in the scottish highlands there was little else we could do other than just sort of hope that it went away. so we ended up spending the entirety of the week going between tents and as you can imagine in such cramped conditions after a while everything starts to piss you off. 

one guy in particular had been a total dick the whole week and i decided i was bored enough that i wanted to get back at him for it. earlier in the week in one of the only interesting parts, this guy had found an entire deer skull, antlers and all, in the woods, i figured it was a good way to get revenge.

i was gonna smash the skull.

i decided that i could probably stamp through it so that's just what i tried. on the first stamp i hit the skull but it just sorta sank into the mud, the next stamp definitely did damage and there was a loud pop. 

it was just a shame the damage was that i had landed on the antler and it rammed its way through my hiking boot and about an inch into my foot.

needless to say the whole removal process and then limping about camp with a bin bag on my foot for the rest of the week made me regret getting pissed so easily.

"input: Text: this happened a while ago and will haunt me for the rest of my mortal life. in school i do dt food (cooking, nutrition etc) as a subject. before we had been making jam tarts and i had some jam left in a jar. being the lazy person i am, i left the pot in the bottom of my bag and didn't take it out because it was so buried in all the crap in my bag. fast forward by about two weeks (yes two weeks) and i still hadn't moved my jam. i got into maths and, being the last lesson of the day, i chucked my bag into my desk and opened it up. oh crap. my jam jar had exploded in my bag. i went silent then shouted ""for fucks sake!"", grabbed my bag and just pegged it out of class. no one had said a word to me as i left. i was seriously pissed at this because there was just jam everywhere. on about 4 different work books, a text book, my calculator, all my stationary and my phone and house key. i was going in and out of class getting all my stuff. i had to put all of my jammy stuff in an empty locker in a plastic bag just to stop it leaking. i sorted all my stuff out and got to work getting the jam off. as i worked i was quietly cursing loud enough to hear, repeatedly saying things i'd never say in front of anyone in any of my wildest dreams. suddenly, i looked up. there were about 10 different people just staring at me. great, it was open day. the one day of the year when there are parents and five to ten year olds milling around the school, and there were three sets of parents, 4 kids and a sixth former guide just staring at this angry thirteen year old who has jam all over his hands and all his stuff outside a maths lesson cursing to himself. the parents looked horrified. i just stared them down with the most emotionless stare known to mankind and the sixth former hastily moved them on. bet i won't be seeing those kids at my school any time soon. finally i had cleared everything up. i put everything into separate bags and left them outside my class. then i realised something else. it was a revision lesson for an algebra test. and i'd missed half of it. (i ended up getting a crap mark funnily enough). the lesson passed and i didn't talk to anyone. so the end of a very jammy lesson came about and so i had to talk to my maths teacher. being the best teacher i've ever had, she helped me clear my stuff away, lent me some tissues to wipe away my jam that had formed a second skin over my hands and just asked me to tell her what happens if something like this happens again, god forbid it. then came to the awkward convo with my parents. i've been reduced to a crappy old reebok bag for the last months and a half and am still getting weird looks... i've not eaten jam of any sort since. i spent too much time getting old jam off my hands at home and my books are still sticky from the jam and i can't get it off.

"input: Text: so this happened about half a year ago, but 3 of my mates and i decided it'd be a great idea to get super baked (which is legal where i'm from) and just have a chill day

so the day started pretty swell with us getting a whole bunch of snacks from our local supermarket (around $100 worth) and heading back to the house. each of us then ate a quarter of a cake which we had put an ounce of weed into and smoked quite a few bowls after and got the most baked we have ever been.

a few hours later after watching all of season 1 rick and morty and just generally enjoying life we suddenly realised to our horror we had run out of snacks, and even though we were already really full, the munchies won out in the end. 

for some reason at this point i was craving sour patch kids like no tomorrow and despite my friends just wanting to stay at home and order some take away, i managed to convince my friends to walk up this fuckoff sized hill to go outside (as horrible as that is when baked) and go to the supermarket.

the walk started out really nice, beautiful day, the sun was out and birds were chirping. but slowly as i started to walk up the hill i started to feel really queasy but it wasn't anything that bad, just like the feeling of doing one too many shots where you can force it back down. 

at least that's what i thought. the walk to the super market wasn't that far, around 5 minutes or so, so i decided to tough it through and get those damn sour patch kids. eventually we finally make it to the supermarket and at this point i feel like i just did 10 tequila shots then got punched in the stomach by gregor clegane. 

i'm sure i didn't look to healthy either, so in my panic of me trying to avoid throwing up i sit down on a bench right in the middle of the shops wall near the checkouts, where everyone can see you. i put my head in between my knees and spent around 5 minutes trying to keep this vomit down, with tons of glancing at me probably wondering what is wrong. keep in mind i am super, super baked and even talking with strangers terrifies me, let alone the chance of seeing someone i know at my local supermarket. 

but eventually i just simply can't hold it in anymore. it happens, a foul concoction of everything from chips, powerade, chocolate, 2 minute noodles, other sorts of lollies erupts out of me in proper projectile vomit all over the supermarket floor, at this point my friends have pretty much bailed in their baked panic (do not blame them at all) and i sit there throwing up probably a good 2-3 litres worth of food and stomach acid with people all around me. i was freaking out at this point because i could recognise a few people in the store, all of who were looking at me quite shocked.

then i just fucking get up and run away in my panic as the staff yell at me to stop as i leave my mess behind. 

have to say that isn't one of my most proud moments and i doubt i'll ever be going back to that super market ever again.

"input: Text: so this happened two days ago. i work at a supermarket chain, as a cashier. been there for about four years. pretty mindless job, the pay sucks, but it is a job noneless. 
so anyway, there are a lot of younger girls (early 20's) that work at the same place, doing the same job. we don't count out our drawers, or have key locks on them - for some reason management thinks this is a good idea. we also have two video cameras in the entire store, one in the backroom, and one facing the parking lot. that is it
so on friday, one of the newer girls, who must have been working for about 3 months or so, comes barreling out of the managers office in the evening, her face beat red and balling her eyes out. apparently her register had come up short for the day (by 195 dollars), and my boss was threatening her with firing and arrest.
now i really don't know this girl very well, other then she is a single mom, trying to make ends meet, seems pretty normal enough.
this is where the fuck up happens. for some reason, i'm not sure what came over me, i stop in the path of my boss, who was in the process of following her out of the door, and start completely throwing myself under the bus. i told him i was on her register all day, and that i had told her to go check product dates instead. after giving me an incredulous look, and unleashing a barrage of yelling at me, he basically told me to get lost and don't come back, and expect to be hearing from the police. none of this actually registered until i left the store, what had happened.
so now i'm out of a job, so low paying that i don't even have a savings, and will probably be booted out of my apartment, and expecting to be charged. all for a girl that, for all i know, skimmed money out of the register.

"input: Text: winter is finally upon us, and my house is 100 years old. that means i have ac units to take in and out every year. 

 about four day ago this huge cold front came through my state and we had 20 degree weather plus some snow. that meant i could no longer procrastinate about taking out the five acs i have scattered through out my house. 

 it's a fairly simple process - just take them out the window, weatherstrip the window, and put the acs in the basement. i ended up taking the three ""bigger"" ones out first with no sweat. 

 that's when i go into my nephews room and try to pull his out. what i didn't realize was although his was smaller compared to the rest it was also two times heavier. it also wasn't actually put in right. 

 so i grab it from underneath and lift up the window when all of a sudden the whole thing shifts crushing my right hand underneath it out of no where! somehow this smaller ac is twice as heavy as the others and my hand is pinned against the scalding hot metal radiator. 

 not only is it being crushed. it's also being burned! in one simple motion with my body i pull it up trying to save my hand from burning or being crushed and what happens? the whole thing shoots back from the window and hits the top of my roof hard! 

 i should bring up the fact i just bought a new washer machine and so my concern is 100% not spending any more money on appliances. especially with christmas coming up real quick. i have gifts to buy other people! my mind in that moment was 100% focused on, ""this shit is expensive! hell no!"" 

 so being the quick thinking instinctual genius i am i leap through the window head and arms first super man style while banging my knees and legs against the radiator and window sill. i start sliding across my icy roof chasing the falling ac when i realize i have way to much momentum, and holy fuck i'm about to fall headfirst off two stories! 

 life didn't flash before my eyes. realizing i'm a fucking idiot flashed in my head! 

  luckily, natural reactions took over and i bang my fist, nails, knees and then feet down into the roof as hard as i can and started slowing down. i actually slammed them down so hard i ripped shingles off! 

 right as i stop my speed and avert death ---- i quickly grab the ac cord with one hand and halt basically all of its momentum right as the corner dips and falls into my gutter! one more second later and it would have rotates off! 

 that's when this guy on my street who saw the whole thing starts cheering! he's whooping and hollering loud as hell, and i start smiling. i'm thinking, ""holy shit. that was awesome! i wish i had that recorded! i feel like an action movie hero"".

 all my previous thoughts about my intelligence went out the window as fast as the ac did. 

  i pick the ac up with gusto, and start waddling up the roof. that's when life swiftly reminded i'm still a fucking idiot. 

 you see in my excitement i totally forgot the roof was in fact covered with ice. so not only did i slip but i basically slipped so hard forward that i bet i could have done a front flip with a bit more clearance. 

 for whatever reason i didn't let go of the ac in both hands. maybe my brain knew i was committed to saving it and compromised. one hand held onto the ac from the bottom while the other hand shot out for the window. 

 my full momentum, weight, plus the ac  crushed my hand. i knocked the wind out of my body and hit my head on the window all in a second smooth motion. 

 i have no idea how i didn't let go of the ac or the window but somehow i did. i held onto it like a lost lover and slowly dragged myself into the safety of my house. 

 i'd love to say i went back through the window with style but i did not. i kind of plopped through it like a fish and laid on the ground.

 i guess my nephew finally decided to come and see what the noise was and panicked when he looked at me. he thought i was committing suicide because i was so bloody and banged up with torn clothes. 

 it took me a long time to explain what happened to him. he couldn't grasp how i hurt myself so quickly. 

 i ruined and ripped my clothes. i cut open my knees and shin. i have a deep gash on my head and scalp. i must have caught a nail somewhere on my torso because i have a long scratch. i had a splinter in my toe? (no idea.) i had dark bruises everywhere and could not function physically the next day.

 the top of my hands were beyond recognition. two nails were full of blood and many were ripped. they swelled up and only my thumbs went unscathed. i burnt one hand, tore the skin off both, and crushed one hand badly. i possibly broke the knuckles or worse on one but we will see when i go to the doctors thursday. oh, and i ripped off a nail.
 
 the good news? the ac is fine! just some dents here and there. maybe some skin and blood, but nothing a quick wash can't fix.

 bad news? the roof was damaged a bit.

 the ugly? i scared my nephew and probably lost a ton of respect.

so today (yes, today. a tifu that took place today) i was taking a shower, to get ready for the day. after my like 15 minute shower, i squeegee the water off, get out, and notice the lack of drying devices. now, the towels are right around the corner in a small closet. so i throw on boxers, check to see the coast is clear, it is, and i get out, take a mad dash, and open it. no towels, shit. now i have to dash to my room and grab a slightly used one, that's fine, like 5 steps to my right. i get in, close the door, and grab a towel and try to wrap it around myself. as i do, the dog that was in my room pulls it down, dragging down my towel and my boxers with it. then, with timing only found on tifu and old comedys, my friends mom walks in to see my full naked glory. we stand there for like 10 seconds, and i dash past her and into the bathroom.

now most of the time one would say here ""i'm to embarrassed to look her in the eyes"" but i'm not. i'm to embarrassed to be in the room with her, beacuse well...
she looked 3 times in those ten seconds. not ""oh god he's naked let me close my eyes or look away"" but, ""oh he's naked."" ""yep, naked"" ""ohh.. he is naked."" she stared.

ok so it all started yesterday in english class (i'm in tenth grade english). we had a sub and a worksheet was due at the end of the period. i was sitting in my desk working on the grammar worksheet when i saw the student in front of me selling weed (our desks are arranged in groups and his desk is right in front of mine so we see each other face to face). let's call this student drug dealer ""alex"". our school has a strict no-drug policy and my english teacher has always encouraged us to report illegal drugs. so this is when i decide to tell my teacher via my worksheet(and where the fu happened). i decided to write on my worksheet next to my name ""alex is a drug dealer i saw him selling weed"". i turn in the worksheet to the sub and feel happy about doing the correct thing . well today the worst thing possible could have happened. my teacher was back and told us that she was going to correct a worksheet at random live on the projector. long and behold she grabs my paper and puts it in the projector for everyone to see. well there i am sitting in front of alex as my teacher reads my comment out loud. she immediately called security and had alex escorted out the class. before he left he shouted "" watch your back."" i don't want to go to school tomorrow. i fu pretty bad today. moral of the story kids, don't snitch out someone and have your name on the paper in which you did it.

"input: Text: this fu actually happened today, on my work break.

currently, i am a nursing assistant at a nursing home. about a week ago, i finally plucked the courage to get my septum pierced. i haven't had any problems with it, and i make sure the area is clean throughout the day. so, during one of those cleaning regimes - i retreat to the staff bathroom on my break to bring down my septum piercing (i flip it up during work to conceal it). as i'm sniffing and doing general nose stuff, one of the cleaners and biggest workplace gossips walks in. 

""oh, it's only you."" i say, laughing. i was just glad it wasn't one of the bosses - they hate piercings and body mods.

she gives me this strange look but kind of dismisses what i said, then questions what i was doing.

""oh you know, breaking the rules."" i laugh again, assuming this cleaner knows i have a piercing. i was almost certain she had seen it before. 

she gives me another weird look as i dab my nose with a tissue (i also had the sniffles) and kind of scurries out the door. weird. i forget about it and go back to work. 

about half an hour later, one of the big bosses pulls me aside and asks me to meet with her in the office. she's watching me as we're walking and, being me, i'm always super cheerful and whatever. i must seem.. high, sometimes.

as soon as we get into the office, she questions if i take drugs. i'm like, whaaaaaaat. no, i don't. she then let's me know a coworker has had suspicions that i have been doing cocaine whilst on work premises.

i just roll out with the whole piercing thing and blah blah but my boss kind of buys it and kind of doesn't. so i have to show her the piercing. 

i'm still getting weird looks.

(also, i forgot to mention the train is packed at this point). as she scoots by, she drops something and bends over to pick it up, the train suddenly jerks and i thrust into her from behind. she turns around and says ""you need to keep your hands to yourself!"", i was so taken off guard that i just looked at her and said "" the trains packed and i didn't mean to bump you, so don't flatter yourself"" and sat down. sat there beyond embarrassed for 4 more stops.

"input: Text: this reddit should be renamed to just ifu, because this actually happened last month.

i'm a middle child of 3 kids, both of my siblings are female and i'm the only male in my immediate family, outside of my father. i love them both, but they have ""issues"" that drives me nuts.

my older sister, let's call her cass, is very easy to guilt trip me and other people. i already have a low self esteem already, but for some reason she finds a way to make myself help her by almost falling on my face.

my little sister, let's call her cal, is a massive klutz. i can understand being a little weird, but this chick has been in the hospital as a patient for almost half of her life. one would think she could be a little bit more careful. she also can't hold things very well.

well, anyway, back to what i was saying.

i was at a friends house as it was my birthday the next day and they wanted to have a game night (mostly d&d and some smash 4, nothing big) and i get a call form cass. she wanting to use my laptop for one of her courses. i find this odd, considering she had a laptop of her own and she has word free from her collage.

after a few minutes of begging, i say yes and tell her the password, as well as where i put my spare key (i live in the garage and have a personal lock and key, my mom spoiled me, i know.) she thanked me and hung up, sounding ecstatic and hangs up. i forget about it very quickly.

around midnight, we decided to pack up after our tank had to leave since he had to do something in the morning. i went home and decided to go to bed early. cal was sitting there, looking surprised and stressed.

""oh hey, cityofcyn_!""

cal shouted it out, i can tell something's going on.

""what did you do?""

""nothing.""

""where's cass?""

""no where.""

it might be i take after mom, but i smell bs when i can. i start making it the garage, my sister trying to keep me from entering. when i finally got in, i see cass, sweeping up pieces of my laptop.

apparently, my sisters got me a new desktop and it wouldn't be here for about another week, so they got me  display for show me how it would look on my desk. but instead, my little sister, who was moving my laptop, droped it, causing it shatter (it was a old toshiba, i knew what i was getting into.)

i'm not mad at them, but i am upset that i lost so much (500 gb of images, personal works, music, and games) with little way without paying a large amount to transfer them. i know this isn't really my fuck up, but i figured it was an interesting story to tell, none the less.

i went away to the skate park for some fun. when i got home some guy came over to cut up a giant tree that had fallen on our lawn. he went to the tree and came back a few minutes later and asked us if we *had* a cat. fuck. dusty's leg was ripped off and he bled out behind the tree a few feet from our front door. i guess he got hit by a car. i wish i hadn't tried to pet him, and i don't think i'll tell my family i tried to. he had 4 leisurely years on this earth.

i knew the road he was taking, so i decided to shut my eyes for a bit and lay back - it takes around 45 minutes to get home. i have no idea when i passed out and i woke when the driver suddenly stopped the car. it was dark everywhere and the driver wanted me to get out of the car because he had another pick-up. and i freaked out. 

i was suddenly extremely alert and realised that i didn't recognise any of my surroundings. i started yelling at the driver that he brought me to some unknown place and said some shit like, ""i have a swiss army knife, you can't harm me!"" - yeah, that's how freaked out i was.

oh, and i was refusing to get out of the car. i kept arguing with him when suddenly someone knocked on my window and i yelled this blood-curling scream. turned to see it was my flatmate asking if everything was alright and why i wouldn’t get out of the car. i thought i was hallucinating and actually rolled down my window and pinched my flatmate to see if it were actually him.

needless to say, it was him. i paid the driver and went home. couldn’t sleep a wink after that and now i’m at work again with zero sleep.

my gf had asked me to wash the cat, because it might help her allergies. i had a free evening tonight, and i thought i might try it.

after googling ""how to wash a cat"" a few times, i lured the kitty into the bathroom, and closed the door. now she's mine, i thought. heh heh heh

first, i tried washing her in the sink, as the results had recommended, but my sink doesn't seal well, so after getting the cat's feet wet, i gave up. she sought shelter in the litter box while i prepared the bathtub instead.

i thought that her getting litter on her wet feet sucked, so i coaxed her out, and dipped her in the water, which immediately became nasty because it was filled with litter. so i released the cat, and started changing the water. she immediately hid in the cat box again.

sigh, i thought, this time i'll have to move the cat box. after the water was clean and ready to go, i took the lid off the litter box, and the cat looked up at me with her big kitty eyes. how cute, i thought. i picked her up, and suddenly, there was shit spewing out of her butt.

for some reason, she decided it was a good time to take a dump, and i may have lost my composure, because i tried to get her in the water to rinse her off, but she resisted, which led to her ass spinning around, launching shit in every direction.

and it was liquidy shit, too. the worst kind.

i did manage to wash the cat, eventually, but i have been cleaning for about an hour, and i'm still not done. i may never be clean again.... :(

as i lay soundly asleep, i begin to dream that i'm in africa on safari, never actually been on safari or to africa but i would guess africa. anyway, we're exploring some abandoned brick shelter we found next to a watering hole. suddenly, while standing on the muddy bank, the ground under me gives way and a little slide later my feet are holding the jaws of a crocodile from clamping on me. i look around, there's like six more. knowing i'm in trouble, i grab the closest thing next to me, a big red brick, and hurl it at the crocodile's eye.

"input: Text: i'm new to reddit. i got it a few weeks ago. i saw the tifu subreddit and had to contribute. so i'll do it on a throw away account. this happened several months ago, so i'm sorry this isn't quite a tifu. 
a few months ago i (18, m) was knee deep in sexting. i had somehow started with a past girlfriend over the summer and was really getting into it. i loved the thrill of it. i would sext up to three girls at time while at my dads house (the only place i have wifi for snapchat). for me the process of it was being sharpened. i would send them a picture of myself in a towel after showering, and depending on their reaction i could sift out who would and wouldn't be willing to sext me. these fine ladies would sometimes randomly send me pictures once i had so to speak ""broken the sexting ice."" 
one fine evening i sat in my room, half-consciously playing my latest disappointing investment known as destiny, when i get a snapchat from a girl named melissa. she was a girl a bit older than me (six years or so) who i had started talking to on facebook. she now had my snapchat and had sent me a lot of pictures of herself in her underwear. i opened my ipod expecting another pic of herself in her undies. when i opened her snapchat i ended up staring at it for the whole five seconds that it lasted: melissa had just stepped out of the shower and taken a mirror selfie. the gorgeous brunette was still glistening with water, she positioned her hips in just the right way to give her a nicely curved ass. she pushed her arms together to capitalize on her massive boobs. each one of the things were about the size of my head. i am an ass man, but these ee sized guns were enough to make my blood run cold. she wore a smile that was seductive enough to disarm a nuke.
as soon as i could collect my brain after it being blown to pieces to pieces, i naturally responded with a picture of my crotch. i was shaking with excitement. my hand covered about half of my chubbed noodle (the logic here is that if she wants to see more she has to send more). i captioned it ""send more to see the whole thing."" 
what happened next might come out slightly confusing if you don't use snapchat. i tapped the arrow in the lower right corner, which led me to the list of snapchat usernames. at the top of the list was melissa's name. i tapped her name and hit send with the speed only a testosterone-fueled pervsturbator could have.
my ipod did nothing. the screen remained unchanged. it was an overused fourth-generation ipod touch so it wasn't uncommon for the hunk of shit to freeze up. i waited about five seconds then it flashed a screen that showed the check mark next to a name at the top of the ""recent"" list. i was left staring dumbfounded at my screen. i had just sent a dick pic to my best friends sister. kerrigan had snapchatted me asking if i was going to hang out with brandon (my best friend) that weekend whilst i was about to hit melissa's name. 
the feeling at the time was almost indescribable. i literally felt the blood run out of my dick until it was about the size of a cheeto. i wanted to go take a nap with my car running in the garage, but somehow i managed to pick myself up and snapchat her. kerrigan's immediate response was disgust. in a flurry of explanations, apologies, and begging i somehow managed to get her to calm down and agree not to tell anyone. and if you were wondering i also halfheartedly finished up with melissa. 
before i go on to the consequences of my actions let me tell you about the johnsons (we'll call them that for pun and privacy purposes) as they are a very unique family. i have known the johnsons for five years. they are very sarcastic, yet very likable. very cynical, yet hilarious. very judging, yet very loving. simple, yet very wise. brandon was my first friend when i first came to school five years ago (i was homeschooled until i hit 8th grade). our moms had worked together for a period of time as well, and are now good friends. his older sister kerrigan became a good friend of mine throughout the years. the family literally introduces me to people they know as their ""adopted"" son. so you could imagine the mortification of kerrigan when out of the blue comes a picture of my penis and a demand for ""more pictures.""
skip forward a week. it was my first wrestling meet of the season. to my surprise kerrigan and her friends whom i knew quite well came to watch. i, with my odd sense of humor, threw her a deranged look with a grin and a wave. she awkwardly waved back with a somewhat creeped out smile. after the meet they all approached me. lacy, one of kerrigan's friends started the conversation with ""so i heard you sent dic pics to kerrigan."" i turned to a giggling kerrigan slightly angry and said something like ""really?"" 
eventually over the next weeks i found out from brandon that when kerrigan got my savory snapchat she ran screaming down her dorm hallway that i had sent her a nudy-judy . she also mentioned it in a massive group chat on facebook that contained her whole class and my art teacher. if that wasn't enough she went out of her way and called her mom and my ex specifically to tell them what i did. my ex in turn called up her friends to let them know the immensity of my blunder. mrs. johnson found this sensational, she told brandon, mr. johnson, and the entire staff at the nursing home at which she works. the johnsons weren't angry because they knew i didn't mean to send it to kerrigan. they knew to keep it a secret from my mother. mom would probably brand a cross into my forehead if she knew about this (god, i'm a genius. posting this online was a great idea). eventually the whole school knew. even a few teachers knew about it. one of them called me out on it in the middle of social issues class; thus, making me the most laughed at person in the school for the whole day. i even got shit from some small kids in the elementary.
ever since that fateful day i haven't sexted. i right away told the people i was doing it with that i was going to stop. i still get laughed at by entire classes at least once a week, but i deserve it, and i do have to admit it is pretty funny.
this tifu has a few morals: sexting is a bad idea, true friends never press charges, and always double tap someone's name in snapchat to respond.

"input: Text: so in 6th grade, i fucked up, but it became one of the foundations for one of the best things in my life. here we go: 

the year is 2007 and i'm in 6th grade. in my town that means that i'm spending my last year at the elementary school that hitherto, i've spent my entire academic and social life. next year my class will be merging with the classes of the 5 other elementary schools in my town to form our middle school. as anyone who has advanced to the next level in school knows, this is a huge fucking deal. every 6th grader knows that 7th grade is when you take that next step towards adulthood and really start living. because the legendary middle school years can be full of sleepovers, pizza parties, energy drinks, maybe even a cringe-worthy first kiss. the future is bright! if you're among the pre-teen cultural elite. that is.

luckily for me, a generally awkward 11 year old leaving elementary school with 2 friends and half a library of fantasy-fiction books in my room, my rec center plans two high-stakes, be there  or be square, social-catapult type events to introduce all the students across the city to each other. the first is a test of athleticism,  an absolutely crucial skill for any young man hoping to join a posse of cool young gentlemen and perhaps attract a gal. the second is a social gala, a dance per se, where one may hope to waltz themselves into popularity with rhythmic excellence and social grace. this fu happens at the open gym. 

it’s on a friday night, and everything starts of smoothly. mom executes a perfect car-pool drop off, getting us there right on time because everyone knows that’s the coolest time to arrive at an event. everything starts great, strangers from across the town are all present and showing off their athletic prowess.  double dutch is happening, an intense round of freeze tag is in-action, and i’m making friends! i make one friend in particular, we’ll call him hank, who seems to be quite alright. i helped him out of a few tough spots during freeze-tag and i’m getting along with his crew from across town real nicely. so we grab ourselves a few libations to cool down and chat before getting involved in another feat of athleticism. after a few capri-sun, and plenty of laughs (i had the best fart jokes),  an important announcement is made. it’s wiffle ball time. 
this is important. for one: the balance, poise, speed and strength required by the game of wiffle ball make it the perfect example of a preteens athleticism. but my town is actually the town where the original wiffle ball factory is (honestly, they probably got the supplies donated because of this) and in my eyes this makes this about as important a local pastime as hotdogs and fireworks on the 4th of july!  

teams are made, and as it turns out i’m opposing hank, the friend i’m currently courting. this is perfect, because obviously the best way to make new male friends is to assert your dominance by beating them via sport. 

i immediately find my way in to line. i’m batting 4th.  a powerful position. clean-up hitter. 

hank happens to be pitching and he’s doing alright. he strikes out two of the three batters ahead of me because he has a mean slider. but i’m ready for that. 

after what seems like ages i step up to bat. 

i arrive he plate with glory in my head. nay, glory within in reach. there’s one man on base but and rbi isn’t cool. a single isn’t cool. i know the only option for me is an inside the  gym home-run. the epitome of sportly excellence.  my eyes are on the crown of middle school popularity, and this skinny yellow plastic bat is going to fly me there. obviously i call me shot a la babe ruth. 

the ball leaves hank’s hands. 

suddenly everything is slow motion. i can see the ball spin as it approaches me. it begins to dip but i’m ready for it. i’m going to catch the ball the second crosses the plate and send it to mars with a rocket up its ass. all i here is the telltale whistle of the wiffle ball. it’s within my reach and i swing away! swing myself to absolute glory! i connect to the ball and…

i slice it, right to the ground where it slowly rolls towards the pitcher. as people laugh at my misfortune i only have one option, to sprint towards first base and put my fate in the hands of hank’s reflexes. or perhaps there’s a second option? perhaps i toss this bat towards the ball i just woefully under-hit, to knock it off course and complete my original plan to sprint my way to  a homerun. 

the second i have this idea, my arm puts it into action, i toss the bat expertly towards the ball to knock it ever so slightly off course. only i don’t toss the bat. with an accidental flick of the wrist i turn that bat into a plastic missile that’s heading right for the ball. right for where hank is currently lunging. right for his nose. literally, square on the bridge of  his nose. 

the rest is a bit of a blur, there’s shouting, hank falls down. chaperones rush to his aid. children scream at me for being the bat-happy maniac with a temper that i seem to be. the opposite of glory.  hank was attended to by an emt that came to stop his nose from bleeding, and luckily it was just a minor break. i spent the rest of a night wallowing in the corner of the room, wishing i didn’t exist, or have such poor in-the-moment judgment. i felt terrible for hurting a kid i thought i was becoming friends with. and getting middle school off to such an awful start, was a poor consolation. like icarus i flew too high with my dreams and plummeted to my doom. 

that september, i walked into my homeroom class only to find hank sitting directly behind me. my heart dropped, i knew my reputation as a bandit-bat-basher would follow me to my grave. instead, he cracks a joke about it. i ended up sharing classes, laughs and some of the best memories of my life with that kid for the next 6 years (throughout middle school and high school). to this day he’s one of my best friends, (and he still has a bump on the bridge of his nose (from yours truly).

face: as good as a blade, which is to say, not as good as i'd like but nothing i can do about that. plus side: no cuts, which i can't say for the razor.  
arms, legs, chest, belly, hands, feet: acceptable. my arms and legs aren't particularly hairy, so i got a preliminary shave before my shower and touched up after, when i could see the hairs better. hands and feet are even less hairy, but still hairier than a cis woman's.  
armpits: and here's the fuck-up. i knew that my pits are the single most sensitive region of my skin, and i knew that they were irritated for days after the last time i tried to shave them with the lady remington. well, they seemed fine at first. then in the shower, the soap hit them and ow. so i put some shaving cream on them (it has moisturizer in it) to see if that would help and ow. so i just rinsed them off, because whatever. i finished up, got out, and dried off.

then i put deodorant on and ow the fires of hades have taken residence beneath my arms so i bore the pain for a moment, hoping it would go away. nope. bracing for more pain, i use the towel to wipe off the deodorant. then i grabbed a different deodorant (a spray type, without an antiperspirant) and sprayed it across my chest and then sprayed it into one of my armpits. cue hellfire again, wipe that shit off, you know the drill.

so, once the irritation subsides in a few days, i'll switch back to a blade for my pits. but the lady remington works well everywhere else, so that's a plus.

"input: Text: happened a month or 2 ago but here goes.

i bought a fitbit from rei to track my steps, sleep, heartrate etc. for a new months it was awesome and worked flawlessly. i had worn it in the shower a few times and even though the fitbit says its water resistant, you should take it off when you shower. so after a long day i took a much needed shower but was too lazy to take my fitbit off. long story short, it got water inside it and stopped working.

rei has an awesome return policy where you can basically return your purchases for any reason within a year, and since my fitbit was still under warranty i went back to get a new one. i got into the store and tell the help desk employee my fitbit got waterlogged and i would like a replacement. here's where the fu happens. the employee gives me a $150.00 refund for the fitbit then tells me to go pick out a replacement. i go to the fitbit section to get a replacement and there aren't any left. one of the employees goes to the back and gets me one from storage, gives it to me and tells me i'm good to go. i walk out of the store.

apparently you're supposed to go back to the help desk after you get your replacement, this they did not tell me. so i walked out of the store with a new fitbit plus the refund from the old one. i check my bank balance when i get to my car and it says the $150.00 was added to my bank and i assumed they would just charge me for it when they go through processing the return. 2 days goes by and i check my bank balance again, the money is still there. 

i debated keeping the money and the fitbit since it was the store's fault they didn't tell me to go back to the register, but my morality got the best of me and i went back and sorted it out. they thanked me for my honesty and gave me a $20 giftcard to the store.

"input: Text: we just got back from a camping in 31°c. i used the toilet to pee.. a lot. 

we got back into town, offloaded the trailer and i figured i'd dump the full grey water tank (dish/sink used water tank). 

unfortunately - i didn't think to check if the 2/3 full black water (poo/pee holding tank) valve was in or out. 

the moment i open the valve cap, dark chunky water with a heavy ammonia smell absolutely blasts out - spraying me and the driveway, the white fence. 

i immediately see what i've done, panic and run for the hose so i can at least dilute the stench. the hose (fancy xhose) is tied in knots and the awful smell is building. i run the hose, start spraying the drive way with reckless abandon... and realize that the black water valve hasn't yet been closed. 

i close everything out, let the water run down the driveway for a good twenty minutes with some dish soap liberally squeezed on the driveway for good measure. 

it's been an hour and it only smells like strong yet stale pee now if the wind kicks up.

"input: Text: so this is happening right now, but first a backstory.  i had just come home from italy yesterday, and fell asleep at 7 pm est (no unpacking anything).  i ended up waking at 3 am est (still not used to the 6 hour time difference).  i just lied around in bed waiting for 5 am est to come around so i can get ready to head to work.

i have a medical condition in which i have trouble staying awake throughout the day (been tested, etc.)   it's not like narcolespy (where people fall asleep at random) but its hyper-somnolence (in which the chemicals in my brain are basically not telling me to wake up so i get tired throughout the day, as if i haven't gotten any sleep (when in fact i've gotten perfect sleep (been tested, etc.).  so the first thing i do when i wake up is i take my vyvanse, so it can start working and i can get through the day somewhat normally and not feeling constantly exhausted.

i have a second medical condition which is ibs-d (something i wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy).  to control it i take a powder drink every night, well just getting home finally i forgot about my drink and went straight to bed.  (also i had taco bell the night before).  so when i woke up, i realized this and wanted to take lomotil so i could prevent the explosion in my pants from happening.

this is where the fu starts.  i took the medicine, head to work, and about an hour later i start to feel weird.  well i have trouble sleeping and therefore i have ambien, and at that moment i realized i took my vyvanse and ambien 15mg of it.  so the fu starts here, and who knows how much longer of the fu will continue.  i'm hoping the vyvanse will wear off the affects, and i'm trying to get a hold of my partner who is still asleep about what i should do.  i had an adderall from when i was being prescribed adderall before switching to vyvanse but i don't know where that prescription is.

hopefully the vyvanse will counteract with the ambien and everything will be good, we shall see, so this might or might not be the end of the post.

"input: Text: this happened about a year ago during my finals. everything was going fine, i was studying, and doing fairly well on my exams, i was always on time, and always prepared for whatever. 
well, not exactly, turns out i should've focused a bit more on the exam schedule.
my school has this weird thing where they put the exam dates for 8th 9th and 10th grade on the same schedule but on different columns, and by some miracle, the exam order for 9th and 10th grade was exactly the same, well, except for the last 2 sessions. 
and that's a problem because i always looked at the 9th grade order, not the 10th, so one day, when i thought i had a free day to chill and catch up, i get a call from my angry and obviously rushing mother to get dressed as i missed out on half of my business exam, i get a strange look in my face and question the sanity of such a statement before looking at the schedule, really looking, and realizing my fuck-up. i paled on ran around like a crazy chicken, putting on my school uniform, making myself look presentable and studying all at the same time.
i had only done one 20 page chapter, and had another 3, each longer than the last, i had at most, 15 minutes. 
in those 15 minutes i went into an adrenaline based rapid super study mode while simultaneously praying to weird deities i invented, like time-reversoro and unfuckitupit. 
my calls went un-answered and i went into the exam nearly blind. as i entered school premises i rushed into the filled classroom like a madman, my eyes sweeping over the room as my disheveled panting figure grabbed everyone's attention, their eyes followed me as i sat down and rapidly wrote some scientific gibberish on my paper, i relied on my memory completely and likely siphoned every possible detail i could think of. 
thankfully, i passed. 
and got the highest grade in class. 
which admittedly, wasn't that high, and got me into a ton of trouble, still, its some form of achievement right?

"input: Text: tifu, or rather last year i did. this happened during my senior year of high school. i was in my principles of engineering class, and we were designing tiny houses. the houses needed to have a place to sleep, a bathroom, and a kitchen. i figured i'd save some space by getting one of those stoves that also has a built-in refrigerator and sink. so, i proceed to go on google images to find a good brand/model. i find [a nice-looking one](http://www.appliancesbuyphone.com/images/p/ck362.jpg) and proceeded to click ""visit page"". 
well, after i went to the page, i got a screen that has my school's logo on it and says ""you are not allowed to view this page because it is categorized as **porn**."" i'm a little confused, but our school's filtering system is pretty weird. i think that maybe i accidentally clicked on something else. i try again, and the same thing happens. after the third attempt at finding out more about this stove, i get a message: ""you are suspended from internet use for the next 24 hours"" (or something like that). i ended up being a day behind on the project because i couldn't get the dimensions for the stove and had to go to school early one day so i could finish it.
also, when i tried going to the page at home, it was just the website for the company that makes the stove. i have no idea why my school thought it was pornographic. i'm glad i don't go to that school anymore because they banned pretty much everything that wasn't gmail and their own website.

"input: Text: it was a rainy afternoon. my coworkers and i were heading to lunch and the place we were arriving to was already packed in their main parking lot. there also was a driver being indecisive and almost crashed into us on her way out of the restaurant. so we ended up parking in the back-lot. there was a platform between the two lots and instead of crossing the sidewalk like a normal fucking person i decide to jump it(to get to the other side). no big deal, it was only 3 feet.

nah. it turns out i couldn't keep my balance the moment i landed and scraped my right knee. i heard my coworkers yelling my name out of worry and as i was about to tell them i'm fine i turn my head right and i see a back of a car a few centimeters from hitting my face. that same indecisive driver almost backed into me.

"input: Text: surprise surprise, this actually happened years ago. seven years ago.

a little back story, when i was 14 my cousin made me get my nipple pierced as a birthday present for herself. my cousin loves making me do things i don't really want to because she's evil and likes to make me suffer. which is why this was a gift to herself. why didn't i fight back and say no? there's no arguing with her. ever. and as i'm sure people will ask, how did i manage to get my nipple pierced at such a young age? her mom payed for it and since we have the same last name she just said she was my mom. also, what kind of place agrees to pierce an underage girl's nipple? the kind that is set up in a swapmeet. yeah. 

anyway, i got it pierced and it actually didn't hurt. at all, for an hour, then the 3 month healing period started and that was a bitch. but i loved it. my god did i love this thing. i took care of it too. i cleaned it regularly, i had many rings for it, and i loved showing it off. especially because i was so not the kind of person you'd expect to have a nipple piercing. i was that girl that sat in back of class reading books the entire time and never talked to anyone. i loved this thing so much sometimes my friends would catch me pulling the neck of my shirt open so i could admire it. 

onto to the sad part. three years later. i was showering. i was scrubbing my chest rather vigorously with my loofah because i used to get horrible acne there if i didn't exfoliate often. i swiped across my chest and my nipple ring got caught in the loofah. now, i wasn't wearing a regular doorknocker that day. i was wearing an eyebrow ring with cones instead of balls, why? because it looked cute. like a little devil. well, i yanked that loofah. i yanked it hard. and i felt pain. true pain. pain starting from my nipple and spreading to my armpits then my navel. it felt like hitting your funny bone. multiplied by a million. i fainted in the fucking shower. remember, when i got it pierced, it didn't hurt? but this. oh. my. god. i still haven't felt anything that painful ever since and i kicked a sea urchin once. 

well, when i came to, i looked down at my nipple expecting the worst. but it was totally fine! it was tender, but it was fine. or so i thought.

two weeks later i was changing the ring and i noticed the skin around it looked dry and little scaly and swollen and it looked crooked. so i picked some of the skin near the inside of the piercing, and i had to tug at it. at first nothing. but a few tugs and it tore a little! and pus came pouring out! at this point i thought i might loose my nipple. i love my nipple you guys. i almost cried. but i didn't. instead i took my boob in one hand and with the other hand i pinched my nipple and squeezed. and so much puss. and then blood. and then nothing. and then the tears finally came. 

i never put the ring back in. my nipple has two scars now. it still makes me sad. especially because one scar is lower than the other. i have a crooked nipple piercing scar.

"input: Text: one of the companies i work with has outsourced much of their phone support to native america. as a result of this and the fact most company-wide it related communications come from my email address, i regularly get emails and calls from people looking for a quick answer to almost any it related question. i typically ignore them. occasionally, if i'm in a good mood and it's a simple thing, i'll reply. 

so, today i get a call from ""carson"" in security (i can't say whether i'm using his real name or not, because i could barely understand him through the thick southern drawl). he accidentally disconnected the video cable to the building's digital display system doing something. what he was doing, i can only guess, but it's an educated guess after i found out what happened later. anyhow... from what he described, there's three computers at that desk: one is the computer that all of the digital displays in that park mirror, one is the computer that monitors and configures the security badge system, and one owned by the security contracting company that is extranet (not on the company's network system) for their email.

i only answered the call because the masking told me it came from inside the company and possibly important, so i tell him i can't assist. he apologizes for calling me directly, but says ""i hate calling [the helpdesk] and having to repeat everything i say to 'habeeb', and i'm in a real hurry."" (i should point out that his southern accent was of a variety that made it hard for me to understand, so i can empathize with ""habeeb""). he tells me he accidentally unplugged the ""tv system"", which i gather he thinks is a closed circuit system, and needs me to help him ""sort the spaghetti"" so the digital display system will be functional when people come to work in a few minutes. after telling him that he should call the a/v group, and him persisting, i ask him to look for a digital splitter box and describe what it looks like. finally, he finds it, and when i ask him to read what it says, he rattles off the brand and other non important things before saying ""vga input.""

i tell him to find a vga cable, and he has no idea what one is. i describe it to him and he says there are two like that. i tell him to contact the a/v group again, but he starts swearing because it's now 8am, and people are arriving, it'll take too much time, etc. exasperated, i ask him what color the two cables are, and he says one is blue and one is white. ""a-ha!"" i think, ""the blue is the vga and the white is dvi."" since most of the cables that come with monitors are colored that way. i tell him it's the blue one, he tells me he's plugging in the blue cable, and after a moment i ask ""all set?""

there's a long silence, as he probably had set down the phone. i ask if it worked again, and he just exhales. 

after another couple seconds he says, ""that wasn't the right cable, so it's gotta be the other one. thanks a heap,"" he says politely, and hangs up. happy to have the call over and pleased with the fact i did someone a solid, i go back to reading my emails and forget about it.

so it was this evening i was doing a lync session with one of the teams from that company. halfway through, one of the guys passes the screen sharing to someone else to present, and the second guy says ""hold on, not yet! i have a video chat going..."" and everyone laughs. i ask ""oh, so did they finally pilot 2013 for you guys, now?"" (that company disabled lync video and isn't on 2013 lync, yet) to which everyone laughs harder. when they realize i'm totally oblivious to what they're taking about, they tell me some security guy in the ""brain lanes"" (sarcastic nickname for the r&d complex) shared some video chat window he had with all of the digital displays, and was promptly canned.

i didn't tell them about the phone call, nor did i ask about what was in the video chat. i just said ""huh,"" and we continued with our meeting. i guess they have white vga cables there. maybe so they can tell them apart when there's more than one, and dvi/dp/hdmi/anything from the 21st century isn't compatible with either monitor or computer. 

poor guy.

"input: Text: i wake up, eat breakfast, pretty much a normal day. then i randomly run into a door, which gives me a lovely bump right in the middle of my forehead and a decent headache. i'm normally not a very clumsy person, but today, for whatever reason, my body decided to spaz out at every chance it got. anyway, i'm driving to my morning swim practice still wincing at the bump on my head. i get to practice, do the normal workout, and when we take a break to practice flip turns i completely fuck up, turn too close to the wall and slam my ankles onto the pool deck instead of into the water. yay. for the rest of the day, every time i step i cringe and i'm doing a halfway limp to try and minimize the pain.  later that day, i'm rushing to get to work, running a little late so i call my boss and she says it's no biggie. when i arrive, i get to the parking lot, open the door of my truck, and drop both my keys and my schedule on the ground.  i'm a little flustered because i'm already late and i really do not have time for this shit.  i jump out and pick up my keys, but the schedule blows under my truck, so i bend over to try and find it. now, the pants i'm wearing are a kinda casual pair of business-y capri/pants that are a little bit snug, which i like because they make my butt look nice.  as i bend over, the pants rip. they must have a little too snug.  not just a little tear or hole either, they fucking rip on the seam that is pretty much a line down my butt all the way from the top of the pants to my crotch area. fuck. also, i'm wearing a thong so i'm flashing my ass to everyone behind me. also, i'm on my period, so my lovely feminine products are there for the world to see. great. the only upside was that my boss laughed so hard at my bruised forehead, semi-limp, and torn pants that she completely forgot about the fact that i was 30 minutes late.

"input: Text: background info: i like soccer a lot and i think it's really fun to play even though i'm really bad at it. i have a strong body that can play pretty much any sport, but i never really had the motivation to start anything. also i'm fifteen and a girl.

ok.

so i decided to join a soccer team suggested by some of my classmates because of it's easiness and beginner players.

well, they lied.

when i got to the field where the team meets, kids (yes *kids* like 10-12) were flipping around and kicking the soccer ball perfectly. 

fast forward to powwowing near a soccer goal: the coach asks how many seasons we had all played so far. the average was 10-15. i've never played before. 

so we start practicing and i'm sucking. my kicks lack power and are mostly off course. i don't know any soccer lingo and when we go to scrimmage at the end, i play defense and mostly lurk around the back, not doing anything while the coach cheers on the kids.

i hold a straight face through practice but when my dad comes to pick me up i start crying (i've been having a rough week) because i suck on the team and i'm surrounded by kids.

when i finally get home, i tell my mom that i want to quit and he gets mad at me and so i go to my room to calm down.

about an hour later she comes into my room and tells me that she got a refund and that i wouldn't have to pay anymore.

but for some stupid reason, i felt kinda bad, like a failure and for putting my parents through all this shat.

and now i have like forty dollars of soccer gear sitting around reminding me of my fuck up.
