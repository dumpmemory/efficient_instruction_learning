"input: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi declined to say whether  her longtime colleague Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.)  should resign from the chamber as  he  faces sexual harassment allegations.
âWe are strengthened by due process. Just because someone is accused â was it one accusation or is it two?  â¦ John Conyers  is an icon in our country.  He  has done a great deal to protect women â Pelosi told Chuck Todd Sunday on NBC Newsâ Meet the Press. âAs  John  reviews  his  case  I believe  he  will do the right thing.â
The House Ethics Committee launched an investigation into  Conyers â conduct following a report that  he  had sexually harassed a former staffer. Pelosi was among the Democrats to call for that investigation and  Conyers  said  he  would fully cooperate.
 Conyers  announced shortly after Pelosiâs interview Sunday that  he  was stepping down from  his  position as ranking chairman of the House Judiciary Committee while the ethics committee investigates  his  conduct. In a statement following that announcement  Pelosi said that the power of a legacy should not undermine the legitimacy of sexual harassment claims. âZero tolerance means consequences â she said.
Buzzfeed reported on Nov. 20 that  Conyers  had reached a settlement that exceeded $27 000 with a former staffer who alleged that the congressman had sexually harassed her and she was fired because she rejected his advances.The following day  Buzzfeed reported that another of  Conyers â former staffers had tried to sue  him  for making sexual overtures toward her and creating a hostile work environment  but the former staffer withdrew the claim when the court would not let the complaint remain sealed.
Conyers  88  denied the first reported allegation  although  he  acknowledged that a settlement had existed. Regarding the second allegation  a spokesperson for  Conyers â office told TIME that the former staffer had decided to drop the case.

"input: NEW YORK (AP) -- Pfizer Inc. said Friday it is pulling its blood pressure drug Thelin off the market and stopping all clinical trials because the drug can cause fatal liver damage.
 Thelin is sold in the European Union  Canada  and Australia as an oral treatment for severe pulmonary arterial hypertension  or high blood pressure in the pulmonary artery. Pfizer said a review of data from clinical trials and post-marketing reports showed a new link to liver injury. It also consulted with experts about the link between Thelin and the deaths of two patients.
 Liver damage was a known side effect of Thelin and similar drugs  the company said. Pfizer said the withdrawal was voluntary and added that it has withdrawn its filing for marketing approval in the U.S.
 Since there are other treatment options  Pfizer said the benefits of Thelin don't outweigh the risks. It is stopping all studies of the oral drug  which Pfizer acquired in 2008 when it bought Encysive Pharmaceuticals Inc. Encysive had been trying to win marketing approval for Thelin since 2005  but the Food and Drug Administration said it was not effective enough. Other agencies only approved the drug for hypertension that was so debilitating that patients' physical activity was severely limited.
 The chemical name of Thelin is sitaxsentan.

After  McGowan  argued with a trangender activist who attempted to derail a planned speech about her abuse at the hands of Harvey Weinstein  the Women's March hit out at  McGowan  for her ""transphobia"" and for ""denying"" a trans woman's identity.
The Daily Wire covered the incident  which took place at a Manhattan Barnes & Noble. While  McGowan  was giving her speech  a ""trans activist"" heckled her from the audience  accusing her of abrogating her responsibility to trans women  and failing to acknowledge the violence trans woman face  as though  McGowan  was competing to be the most injured victim of men.
 McGowan  was confused  and then hurt. When the activist was finally removed   McGowan  broke down.

"input: Dutch anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders went on trial Monday for alleged hate speech  even as his popularity and influence in the Netherlands are near all time highs.
 Prosecutors say Wilders incited hatred against Muslims with remarks comparing Islam to Naziism and by calling for a ban on the Quran. Wilders argues he has a right to freedom of speech and his remarks were within the bounds of the law.
 If convicted  he faces up to a year in prison. He could keep his seat in parliament.
 On his Twitter account  Wilders said the start of his trial was a ""terrible day.""
 ""The freedom of expression of at least 1.5 million people is standing trial together with me "" he wrote  referring to the voters that made his Freedom Party the third-largest in national elections in June.
 But his lawyer  Bram Moszkowicz  told presiding judge Jan Moors at the start of the trial that Wilders would not answer questions during the trial.
 lawyer  Bram Moszkowicz  told presiding judge Jan Moors at the start of the trial that Wilders would not answer questions during the trial.
 ""My client will  at my advice  exercise his right to silence today  tomorrow and the other days "" Moszkowicz said. Moors then adjourned the case to consider a request from Wilders to explain his decision not to speak.
 He swept into the Amsterdam District Court complex in a police convoy and waved to supporters as he walked into the courtroom at the start of a trial scheduled to last seven days.
 Mohamed Rabbae  chairman of the moderate National Moroccan Council  said outside the court that he hoped judges would force Wilders to issue an apology for his past remarks.
 ""We are not for getting Mr. Wilders in prison. We are for correcting him "" he said.

Talking to scouts and executives on Wednesday  I heard  Boras â name a lot  as some are convinced  his  refusal to bend on  his  demands has created a stalemate for  his  top-of-the-market guys that has a trickle-down effect on other free agents.

"input: In November  Zeltser was placed in a prison hospital after arriving at a penal colony in eastern Belarus  where he was denied medicine  according to lawyers.
On leaving the prison clinic in the eastern town of Mogilyov  ZeltserZeltser said  ""I am glad about my freedom.""
Zeltser  slightly limping  was met by U.S. officials and entered a car with them to head for the U.S. Embassy in Minsk.
Blaus an its authoritarian leader are on a drive to court better political and economic ties with the West  and Washington had said Zeltser's release would help the process.
U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly told reporters earlier that Washington welcomed news that Zeltser would be released.
He said Zeltser's imprisonment was ""a major obstacle in our bilateral relations. We still have other concerns  of course  with some of the actions of the Belarusian government. So we're very happy that this one obstacle has been removed  and we'll review our policy as necessary.""
The Russian-born Zeltser is a high-profile lawyer who headed the non-governmental American Russian Law Institute in New York. He once sued the Bank of New York for $2 billion on behalf of investors who had lost their deposits.
Zeltser is a renowned expert on organized crime and money laundering  particularly in former Soviet republics.
His clients have included Pavel Borodin  a former Kremlin aide who was accused of money laundering by a Swiss court  and Badri Patarkatsishvili  the late Georgian billionaire who was a bitter opponent of Georgia's current administration.
Belarusian authorities said that fake documents Zeltser was carrying were tied to Patarkatsishvili's business interests.

"input: Sleep hygiene needs to be learned  and many companies are using the magic of technology to help parents instill healthy sleep habits in their children. The smart alarm clock  Mella   currently being funded on Kickstarter  is one such device.
 Mella  is an all-in-one sleep aid that is aiming to hit the middle ground between simplicity and functionality. According to  Little Hippo  the company that created Mella  many of the sleep trainers on the market  are either too simplistic for the price or have too many confusing buttons. Plus  many of them are clunky and kitschy  which may appeal to kids but isn't ideal for getting them to drift off to sleep.  Mella  is designed to be both simple and engaging  with a modern design and cute face that appeals to parents and kids alike.
Check out their Kickstarter video for an overview of how  Mella  works:
 Mella  ""goes to sleep"" when your kid does â the face closes its eyes and the night light softly illuminates in the color you choose. ( Little Hippo  recommends amber light for best sleep quality.) You can also turn on your choice of ambient sounds: rain  ocean or white noise.
Morning  though  is when the real magic happens. In addition to a soft  kid friendly alarm (that you set)   Mella 's light turns green and the face wakes up when it's time to get up.
What makes  Mella  unique is the ""play period"" function. Since young kids don't really have a concept of time yet  they can get antsy in the morning when they don't know how long they're supposed to stay in bed.  Mella 's play period starts a half hour before the alarm goes off.  The light  turns yellow and the face gives a little smirk ( it 's supposed to be ""playful"" but  it  looks more mischievous ) letting your child know that they can start to play quietly and it'll be time to get up soon.
Unlike some other sleep trainers   Mella  isn't currently app-enabled.  Little Hippo  is considering adding an app-enabled  Mella  in the future so that parents can choose which version they'd like.
 Mella  is available in pink  blue  and a limited edition Kickstarter green. The stretch goal of $40 000 will unlock a purple option as well. Pledging $39 or more will get you  a Mella  in the first batch  scheduled to be delivered in February of 2018.

"input: What no one mentioned is that Sulzbergerâs journalism is appreciated by a surprising figure: Wisconsinâs Republican Governor Scott Walker  who used an article co-written by Sulzberger to bolster the resolve of wavering GOP lawmakers in the midst of Walkerâs ferocious attack on public sector unions in 2011.
Walkerâs description was generally accurate. The Times article portrays a conflict between the intellectual elites in Madison who âpredictably opposeâ Walkerâs plans and the real Wisconsinites âaway from Madisonâ who believe that âpublic workers needed to share in the sacrifice that their own families have been forced to make.â It quotes six people who work in the private sector who support  Walker âs crackdown on public sector unions  and only two who donât like it.
However  this three-to-one ratio in support of  Walker  seems slightly peculiar  given the voting patterns in the area. The eight Wisconsinites lived in towns across Rock  Walworth and Jefferson Counties.  Walker  won 55 percent of the vote in the three counties in 2010  and 54 percent in the 2012 recall election. Both times  Walker  actually lost Rock County  where Janesville is located  making up for it in the other two  redder counties.
Also notable is  Walker âs excitement that the lede on the story is about a man named Rich Hahn  whoâd been laid off twice by GM. The reason for Walkerâs joy is obvious: The piece originally described Hahn as âa union man from a union townâ who nevertheless believed âsomething needs to be done â¦ and quicklyâ about greedy public unions. However  after the United Auto Workers found no record of Hahn as a member  the Times ran a correction reading that while Hahn âdescribed himself to a reporter as a âunion guy â he now says that he has worked at unionized factories  but was not himself a union member.â

"input: When  Lidia Bastianich  tells you to eat the pasta  you should eat the pasta.
Nearly 20 years ago  thanks to her award-winning PBS shows   Bastianich  became a food star and introduced countless Americans to real Italian cooking  which even then was dominated by ubiquitous red sauce and pasta dishes.  She  credits Julia Child for  her  TV break. After coming to one of  Bastianich âs restaurant  Child âwanted me to teach  her  how to make risotto and then  she  had me on  her  show. The producer then said âyouâre pretty good. How about a show of your own?â And thatâs how it evolved â  she  remembers. Child âencouraged me.  She  said âLidia  you do for Italian cuisine what I do for French.â We remained friends.â
In real life   Bastianich  has a no-nonsense but warm demeanor  which  she  exudes on  her  show. Countless hours spent watching  her  on TV gave me the false sense that we were old friends and at times during our meal  as  she  doted on me  it felt like I had found my long-lost nonna.
âA lot of adults tell me âI watched [the show] since I was a kid with grandma.â You know what that tells me? Itâs been a few years â  she  jokes. âIt pleases me because food is all about bringing people together and relating to each other â  she  adds more seriously.
But even after decades of cooking on TV  running a restaurant empire and helping to start the wildly popular chain of Eataly stores   she  insists that  she  still enjoys cooking at home. In fact   she  just published  her  eleventh book  Lidiaâs Celebrate Like an Italian  which  she  co-wrote with  her  daughter  Tanya Bastianich Manuali  and includes 220 recipes for everything from cocktails to soup to dessert. âI havenât invented one of them â  she  admits. âI modified some. Iâve changed a little bit here and there.â
If anything   she âs too modest and was very concerned about making the recipes as approachable as possible. âI take these recipes and simplify them as much as I can â  she  says  since  she  actually wants the reader to learn them and enjoy using them. While in  her  restaurants  the emphasis is the opposite  itâs âto create that moment that the guest will not be able to do at home.â Most of the dishes at Del Posto certainly would fit into that category. Speaking of which  when I try to get  her  to order more food for  herself   in true grandmother fashion   she  dodges my suggestions and insists âI can talk while you eat.â
While I enjoy a delicious heirloom tomato salad  the aforementioned pasta and perfectly cooked swordfish fillets   she  shares with me  her  familyâs fascinating story of coming to America.  She  was born in Istria  which before World War II was part of Italy  but afterwards became part of communist Yugoslavia.  Her  family fled to Italy and lived in a refugee camp for two years before emigrating to America when  she  was 12. Itâs an experience that  she  thinks a lot about today as the country debates its policies about letting in immigrants. âMost of us are immigrants except for the Indians â  she  says. And for  her  that struggle is personal and one that is wrapped up with being a chef. âFood is all about the story of a people through the ages â  she  reminds me.
When  her  family got to America  she  was in for a surprise. âThe Italian food I didnât recognize it when we first came here â  she  says since it was so different than what  she  had grown up eating.  She  did  however  immediately fall in love with boxed cake mixes that  she  would whip up each night. Catholic Relief Services put them up in a hotel for three weeks when they first arrived and then  her  father found a job and a small apartment in Queens that they moved into.
 She âs reticent to tell me more  since  she âs working on a memoir that should be out next year  which will go into greater detail about  her  familyâs story and  her  rise to culinary stardom. While Iâm a bit disappointed   Bastianich  promises weâll meet next year to discuss  it . I canât wait.

"input: This week    Melania Trump  found  herself  in yet another fashion scandal.  The first lady  was spotted boarding a plane to Texas in sky-high stilettos  though  she  was heading to an area devastated by Hurricane Harvey. Public perception of  Trump  and  her  immediate predecessor  Michelle Obama  couldn't be more different. Fans of Obama paint  her  as a J. Crew-clad woman of the people. Meanwhile   Trump  was slammed for a photo shoot in which  she  twirled a string of diamonds like spaghetti. For fans of  Trump   glitzy designer clothing is part of  her  appeal. Instagram accounts with thousands of followers track her every outfit. The far-right website Breitbart News  which criticized Obama for wearing a $2 290 dress to meet the pope in 2015  wrote that  Trump  was the ""breakout star"" of President Donald Trump's first trip abroad  radiating ""high fashion."" To see how accurate  Melania Trump's  frivolous  filthy-rich reputation is in contrast to Obama's more down-to-earth image  we decided to re-create a theoretical ""week in the life"" of the two first ladies. We wanted to see whether  Trump  was actually spending more than Obama  or whether  she  was just a victim of bad press. We compared seven iconic looks that Obama and  Trump  wore to similar events  from vacationing to campaigning  as well as their price tags. Fashion can be a strategic way for the first lady to send a message to the American people — and  Trump  and Obama both have different reputations and messages to send. Here's how the two first ladies measure up and what it means for how Americans see them. View As: One Page Slides
Campaigning at political conventions  Melania Trump at the Republican National Convention: $2 190 Roksanda dress and $675 Christian Louboutin heels .  Trump  made headlines after buying a Roksanda ""Margot"" dress from Net-a-Porter. The $2 190 dress sold out less than an hour after her speech. She paired the dress with $675 Christian Louboutin heels. Michelle Obama at the Democratic National Convention: $995 dress by Christian Siriano and $675 metallic Jimmy Choo heels. Obama's blue dress was extremely similar to a $995 cobalt-blue dress made by Siriano  a designer who rose to prominence after appearing on ""Project Runway."" Siriano reportedly custom-made the dress Obama wore as she gave her ""they go low  we go high"" speech. Her silver Jimmy Choo heels  spotted by Footwear News  cost $675.
Meeting with  foreign leaders Melania Trump  at the G-7 summit: $53 130 Dolce & Gabbana outfit.  Trump  made headlines when  she  wore a $51 500 Dolce & Gabbana jacket to a meeting with the spouses of some of the most powerful world leaders at the annual G-7 summit in Catania  Italy  in May. While we couldn't identify the first lady's dress and shoes   her  bag was also Dolce & Gabbana and costs $1 630. The first lady has worn Dolce & Gabbana on numerous occasions. The designer Stefano Gabbana has been extremely receptive of the support  posting many pictures of Trump in Dolce & Gabbana outfits on his Instagram. Michelle Obama at the G-20 summit: $474 J. Crew outfit. Obama also made headlines on her first trip to the United Kingdom as the first lady in 2009  thanks to her casual yet fashionable looks. The Guardian described her outfits  many of which were from J. Crew  as ""a pitch of sunny  homely optimism  rather than sparkling glamour."" One of Obama's most memorable outfits of the trip was the one she wore to meet British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Fox News reported that the cardigan cost $298  the tank top $18  and the mint-green pencil skirt $158.
 Charity work Melania Trump at an abuse-prevention nonprofit: $1 150 pair of sandals to complete an otherwise low-key look . Footwear News reported (somewhat snarkily) that  Trump  wore a $1 150 pair of Rene Caovilla sandals to visit HomeSafe in April.  Trump  also wore a $225 pair of L'Agence Margot jeans and an unidentified khaki shirt. Michelle Obama at a food bank: $540 pair of sneakers to complete an otherwise low-key look. In 2009  Obama caused some controversy when she wore a $540 pair of Lanvin sneakers to volunteer at a food bank with Jill Biden. She paired them with a $188 J. Crew sweater.
Joint addresses to  Congress Melania Trump  at a 2017 joint address to Congress: $5 000 Michael Kors suit jacket.  Trump 's Michael Kors look cost an estimated $9 600  combining a black blazer that cost $5 000 and a matching skirt priced at $4 600. Michelle Obama at the 2015 State of the Union: $1 595 Michael Kors suit jacket. In 2015  Obama wore a suit that had been featured on CBS's political drama ""The Good Wife."" The $1 595 jacket quickly sold out after the first lady wore it to the State of the Union address.
 Vacation Melania Trump 's return from Camp David: $303 J. Crew and J Brand.  Trump  recently proved that Obama wasn't the only first lady getting clothes from J. Crew. In late August   she  returned from Camp David wearing a $75 pink top from the retailer. Yahoo Style reported that  she  paired the top with $228 pink J Brand jeans and pink patent-leather flats that we couldn't trace (though Vanity Fair reports they're Manolo Blahniks). Michelle Obama exiting Air Force One in shorts: ? Obama faced serious backlash after being spotted leaving Air Force One for a hike of the Grand Canyon in 2009 wearing shorts. Four years later  Obama called the shorts incident one of her biggest fashion regrets. While Time notes that no brand ever ""stepped forward"" to claim the ""unflattering"" shorts  the entire outfit looks very J. Crew. In any case  it's safe to say it wasn't too expensive.
Inauguration — and why the numbers don't tell the full story  Trump 's fashion picks tend to be more expensive than Obama's. But that's not the full story. First  there's the question of custom-made dresses. For the past three inaugurations  the first lady wore a custom-made look. (Obama wore Jason Wu both times  and  Trump  wore a Herve Pierre gown.)  Trump  has reportedly struggled to find designers willing to work with  her . Meanwhile  many of Obama's most iconic looks are made specifically for  her  and are priceless  such as a custom-made Versace gown with a theoretical price tag of $12 000. Then there's the question of why it even matters. First ladies' outfits are not paid for with taxpayer dollars. You could be horrified that anyone could buy a coat that costs more than the average American makes in a year. But if you're going to criticize  Trump  for wearing $1 000 shoes  you have to criticize Obama as well.  Melania Trump's  2017 Inauguration Ball gown: priceless  custom-made Herve Pierre. Michelle Obama's 2013 Inauguration Ball gown: priceless  custom-made Jason Wu.

"input: John Wojnowski  was abused by a priest during a Latin lesson 60 years ago.  He  has spent the past two decades protesting outside the Vatican Embassy in Washington DC. What keeps  him  going?
The most surprising thing about this protester is -  he  doesn't want to protest.
 He  doesn't want to spend eight hours a day on public transport  waiting for buses and trains  getting to and from Embassy Row in Washington DC.
 He  doesn't want to hold  his  sign in the cold  and the dark  and the snow  and the rain.
 He  doesn't want  his  face to freeze   his  knees to ache   his  fingers to turn numb.
 He  was 54 when the protest started;  he  turns 75 in April.  He  has spent almost a third of  his  life here  on  his  own  holding a sign outside the Vatican Embassy.
""Of course I want to stop ""  he  says. ""But they made it personal.""
As day turns to night  and the temperature sinks   John  sits in a bus shelter opposite the embassy  taping three broom handles together.
It's 4:30pm;  he  left home in Baltimore County  around 35 miles north  at 11:30am.
""I waited 45 minutes for the first bus ""  he  says. ""Then half an hour for the second bus.""
From there   he  took a train to Washington's Union Station  a metro to Dupont Circle  before catching a third bus up the hill to the embassy.
When  he  started protesting 20 years ago   John  lived eight miles away in Bladensburg  Maryland  and drove a car.  He  would protest twice a day: a morning shift followed by the rush hour.
Around 10 years ago   his  car gave out  followed by  his  knees. So  he  started using public transport: bus  metro  bus up the hill.
A year ago  he  left Bladensburg to live with  his  son in Baltimore County.  He  no longer protests daily; instead  it's ""once  twice  maybe three times a week"".
""I try to stay a couple of hours  but it's unpleasant in the dark ""  he  says. ""In summer I stay longer.""
Before  he  moved to Baltimore County   John  came to the embassy every day. After around eight years   he  started taking an annual break to see  his  daughter's family in California.

 Oudin  18  needed just 56 minutes to beat Olga Savchuk of Ukraine 6-3  6-0. Schiavone  the Italian who won her first Grand Slam weeks before her 30th birthday  dispatched Ayumi Morita of Japan 6-1  6-0 in 58 minutes.
 If anything  Schiavone seems to be having fun in the spotlight. Asked why she's a fan favorite  she playfully replied  ""I attract them because I'm beautiful.""
 Schiavone acknowledged that maybe she's a bit more motivated at a Grand Slam than at other tournaments. Schiavone  seeded No. 6  had been just 3-6 since winning at Roland Garros. She lost in the first round at Wimbledon and dropped her opening match at three other tournaments.
 She was pleased that her first-round match was in the grandstand -- a year ago  she was relegated to an outer court.
 ""I like to do it  because adrenaline is coming up and I enjoy much more than play in faraway court "" she said with a laugh. ""Maybe because I am 30 years old and now I want to enjoy with people.""

 Prince Alwaleed bin Talal  presides over a vast financial empire (estimated $35 billion in 2015):
Alwaleed is the largest individual shareholder of Citigroup  the second-largest voting shareholder in 21st Century Fox and owns a number of hotels. TIME even called  him  ""Arabian Warren Buffet"".
MBS  as  the Crown Prince  is known  is the leader who is launching what modernizers hope will be a Saudi Version of the Meiji Restoration[ii] in Japan  transforming the political economy and culture out of necessity â in order to survive in the modern world system.

"input: Laura Ingraham  was one of the few people who saw Donald Trumpâs shocking victory coming. More importantly  as a former speechwriter for Ronald Reagan who saw firsthand how viciously the Bush-aligned establishment despised Reaganâs working-class voters   Ingraham  understands how powerful the conservative-populist movement is and why the elites in the permanent political class have spent gazillions and worked overtime for three decades to thwart it.
In  her  blockbuster new book  Billionaire at the Barricades: The Populist Revolution from Reagan to Trump  Ingraham  the best-selling author  explains how Trump got elected and the forces heâand other economic nationalistsâwill have to battle to implement the peopleâs agenda.
Billionaire at the Barricades is a must-read because  Ingraham   who still gets chills when she sees footage of the crowd at Kemper Arena in 1976 realizing they had nominated the wrong man in Gerald Ford  takes readers on a fast-paced journey through the 2016 campaign cycle and shows how everyone who was blindsided by Trumpâs rise should have seen it coming  especially after Dave Bratâs shocking primary victory over then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) in 2014.
Elites give off the impression that Trumpâs populism on the campaign trail was something they had never seen before when  in fact  every candidate who has won the presidency in the television age has been the one who was the most populist. As  Ingraham  writes  âpresidential candidates invoke the populist style because it connects with working people.â
Conservatism and populism  according to  Ingraham   âoverlap in their opposition to âbig thingsââbig government  big international organizations  big media  big business cronyism.â
Reagan understood that âthese distant  uncaring entities rob people of decision making and ignore their interests â and  Ingraham  notes that âPat Buchanan and Donald Trump summarized conservative populism best when each vowed to put âAmerica first.ââ
âConservative populists tend to support a policy of economic nationalismâpeople-centered economic policies that put the nation and its workers first. They oppose a massive national debt because it weakens America and makes its citizens beholden to lenders â  she  continues. âThey also believe high taxes are bad because they sap workersâ wages and economic freedom. Similarly  they are against huge trade deals and international organizations like the World Trade Organization because they take power out of the hands of voters and give it to a far-away and often hostile global elite.â
When it comes to foreign policy   Ingraham  explains that âconservative populists oppose broad military interventionism and believe military force should only be used when American interests are threatened.â  She  slams populismâs critics who foolishly toss around âthe term âisolationismâ to dismiss populist foreign policy â even though that label does not describe any populist  she  has ever known.
 Ingraham  points out that âthroughout the Cold War  populists were among the strongest voices opposing Soviet communism.â In addition  populists have always believed that âsquandering the nationâs wealth and blood on un-winnable wars and nation-building is unwise. Instead  they support a pragmatic foreign policy based on achieving âpeace through strengthâ by maintaining a strong military and using it prudently.â
Unfortunately  as  Ingraham  details  âsome conservatives took a dangerous detourâ and âthrust us into a bizarre world of globalization  wars based on idealism and nation-building  and intense hatred toward the very voters who accounted for the Reagan coalition in the first place.â
The betrayal started almost immediately after George H.W. Bush won Reaganâs third term. The Bush administration purged Reaganites  and  Ingraham  recalls that Margaret Tutwiler told Reaganite Ed Rollins at a party that âthere are a lot of us who had to suffer during the eight years of Reagan  and now itâs our turn.â
âWe were Reagan people. They were Bush people. We all knew what the differences were â  Ingraham  writes. âMany of the GOP Establishment types who behind closed doors scoffed at Reagan as a dim-witted former actor with anââultraconservativeâ outlook were now working in the Bush administration. They thought it was time to return the Republican Party to what they believed was its more genteel  respectable roots. In effect  it meant the return to power of the Rockefeller Republicans who had worked to deny Reagan the presidency in 1976.â
Bushâs Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman convinced Bush to infamously abandon his âread my lipsâ pledge not to raise taxes  and  in the end   Ingraham  argues that âGeorge H. W. Bush stalled the conservative-populist engine that powered Reaganism.â As Rollins said  âGeorge Bush was the beneficiary of the greatest baton pass in presidential history in 1988  and he and his people tossed it away.â
âGlobalism is fundamentally anti-American because it aims to raze American sovereignty by atrophying our ability to take independent actions that are in our nationâs best interests â  Ingraham  writes  pointing out that globalists do not understand that âbecause of the enormous anti-American sentiment around the world  itâs almost impossible to create a multinational organization where U.S. interests donât become compromised or harmed.â
Just like his father  George W. Bush campaigned as a populist but governed as a globalist.  Ingraham  blames âBushâs decision to aggressively pursue amnesty after his unpopular warâ for insulting the âmillions of conservative-populists who had worked so hard to put him in power.â
âBecause of Bush  conservatives lost everything â  she  continues. âWe lost the House. We lost the Senate. And we lost the White House.â

"input: Ezekiel Elliott âs suspension went into effect after Thursdayâs court ruling  according to the NFL. (Eric Risberg/AP)
The NFL Players Association fought what it felt was the good fight in the  Ezekiel Elliott  case  challenging the NFLâs six-game suspension of the second-year running back for the Dallas Cowboys in federal courts because it believed that  Elliott  had been wronged and that the leagueâs system of justice under Commissioner Roger Goodell is deeply flawed.
 Elliott  spoke of clearing  his  name.
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones had his playerâs back  saying that  Elliott  had not been treated fairly by the league. And oh  by the way  the Cowboys also need  Elliott  in their lineup desperately  Jones acknowledged as well.
[NFL says Ezekiel Elliottâs suspension is in effect after appeals court denies him an injunction]
 Elliott  has begun serving  his  six-game suspension under the personal conduct policy and  barring yet another last-minute legal twist  will not play Sunday when the Cowboys face the Falcons in Atlanta.  He  will have missed four games by the time  his  appeal of the rejection of  his  injunction is heard by a federal appeals court Dec. 1.
In the unionâs case  that question is yet to be answered. Certainly the NFLPA was doing all that it could for  Elliott . But for the union  the issues are bigger than one suspension and one case. The NFLPA wants a fundamentally different system of player justice than the one used by Goodell and the league under the collective bargaining agreement and the personal conduct policy. In the meantime  the union is doing what it can to ensure that cases are decidedly as fairly as possible  in its view  and playersâ rights are protected as much as possible under the current system.
But those changes probably will have to come  ultimately  at the bargaining table as part of the next CBA rather than in the courts. The union managed to delay the  Elliott  suspension for half a season. But now  Elliott  is about to sit. The NFLPA managed to delay the four-game suspension of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady  through the courts  for an entire season in the Deflategate case. But Brady sat out the first four games of last season. The union managed to prevail in court in a disciplinary case involving Adrian Peterson  only to lose on appeal.
 Elliott  has denied that  he  was guilty of domestic violence in a series of incidents last year in Ohio involving  his  former girlfriend.  He  was not charged with a crime. But the NFL determined after its investigation that  Elliott   in  its  view  was guilty of domestic violence.
 Elliott  has said the courtroom challenge was  for  him   about justice and  his  reputation. Was it worth it for  him ? Only  he  can answer that.
But in terms of on-field considerations for  Elliott  and the Cowboys  itâs highly debatable whether the decision to go to court was a good one  in retrospect.  Elliott  could have missed the first six games of the season.  He  would have returned and played the past two games  and the Cowboys would have  him  in the lineup for the second half of the regular season and beyond.  He  would have been available for the seasonâs biggest games.
As things now stand   Elliott  wonât play again until Christmas Eve.  He  will have to regain  his  game sharpness and get back in sync with the Cowboysâ offense in a hurry for the games that could determine the outcome of the Cowboysâ season. In the meantime  they will have to try to get by with backup running backs Alfred Morris  Darren McFadden and Rod Smith and attempt to remain in postseason contention without  Elliott .

"input: Now  one of the most powerful figures in comedy —  Louis C.K. —  has been accused of  and admitted to  sexual misconduct. Five women spoke to the New York Times with consistent stories: The comedian steered professional conversations into frankly sexual areas and  in some cases  ask if he could expose himself to them  and proceed to masturbate.
In a statement on  Friday  Louis C.K.  admitted that the women's allegations were true  and  he  expressed remorse.
Indeed   Louis C.K.  has attained  his  status at the top of the comedy world as a result of  his  willingness to make  himself  appear damaged and vulnerable  building stand-up sets around the frank discussion of  his  sexual hangups and basest urges.
In a 2011 stand-up special   Louis C.K.  talks about  his  ""constant perverted sexual thoughts."" YouTube
In a world where sex is a go-to comedy topic  women who find themselves the objects of sexual misconduct have little recourse. Comics  after all  are essentially freelancers; no professional infrastructure exists to redress sexual offenses. Several of  the women who talked to the Times about Louis C.K.  spoke of the tremendous power differential  they  felt as comics just embarking upon a career  in contrast to a hugely successful comedian  who abused  his  status as potential mentor.
For years  women have responded to sexual misconduct in the comedy world by creating whisper campaigns to warn other women about sexual predators. This is how the actions of comedians like Louis C.K. and Bill Cosby could attain the status of ""open secrets"" for years — stories kept within the industry  addressed publicly only obliquely  if at all  out of fear of professional or legal reprisal.

"input: After a slight scare when Federal Communications Commission (FCC)  Chair Ajit Pai  received a note to evacuate in the middle of  his  closing argument in favor of overturning net neutrality rules implemented by the Obama administration in 2015  the commission voted to end those rules Thursday.
 Pai  spent the majority of  his  closing argument reiterating  his  position on why the Orwellian-named net neutrality rules â which essentially implemented federal oversight of the internet under Title II regulations created in the 1930s to manage the Ma Bell telephone monopoly â had been an Obama administration mistake.
Prior to 2015 when net neutrality was implemented  the internet was regulated under what  Pai  is fond of calling a âlight-touch frameworkâ; simply put  the federal government had less regulatory oversight which allowed internet service providers and tech companies the ability to invest and innovate. Thatâs why the internet is as robust and efficient as it is.
 Pai  said the net neutrality rules were âexpress ordersâ from the Obama White House to the FCC  and led to less innovation and investment in the internet framework for the last two years  citing several specific examples. The environment that allowed the internet to thrive before the Obama-era rules âwasnât heavy-handedâ¦regulation â  Pai  said  which led to the $1.5 trillion investment in internet services and networks that gave America unfettered access.
 He  also noted  in contradiction to dissenting Democrat commissioners Jessica Rosenworcel and Mignon Clyburn (who delivered a nearly 20 minute âeulogyâ to net neutrality)  that people who complain about the internet donât complain about Internet Service Providers (ISPs) potentially blocking or throttling content  or that they might discriminate against Internet traffic of their competitors. Instead they complain that thereâs not enough choice regarding ISPs and that they might have no access at.
 Pai  noted that a lighter touch regulatory environment  where ISPs are free to start up and innovate  would address both of those problem.
In short   Pai  said the decision to overturn net neutrality âis not going to destroy the internetâ¦is not going to kill democracy  [and] is not going to stifle free expression online.â

"input: WASHINGTON â President Donald Trumpâs Russia probe lawyer  Ty Cobb  previously represented  billionaire Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal   according to previously overlooked media reports and emails shared with HuffPost. The kingdom unexpectedly arrested  the prince  along with more than a dozen other prominent Saudis over the weekend in a move observers interpreted as a power play by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Trump has close ties to Saudi Arabia and Prince Mohammed   the Saudi crown prince  said to be behind the arrests  including Alwaleedâs. Several weeks ago  White House adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner paid a secret visit to the kingdom and spent significant time with  Prince Mohammed   according to Politico and the Washington Post.
 The president  pushed the kingdom to use the New York Stock Exchange for the upcoming IPO of a portion of its national oil company  Aramco  in a tweet Saturday just hours before the crackdown.  He  also praised the kingdomâs policies in a call with Saudi King Salman  the crown princeâs father  the same day.
 Cobb  spent more than three decades working on white-collar cases before joining Trumpâs team.  He  resigned from  his  longtime firm  Hogan Lovells  in July. At the time  business news service ALM Media reported that  Cobb  had previously worked for members of the Saudi royal family  citing a Hogan Lovells page that now appears to have been taken down.
A 2012 Business Insider story by reporter Nicholas Carlson was more specific. The story said that  Cobb  had threatened to sue an American who had attempted a lawsuit against Alwaleed for allegedly threatening him with beheading and having him detained at gunpoint while he worked for the princeâs son.
Emails from Mark Mazo  another partner at Hogan Lovells  to Toronto-based businessman Alan Bender  who was representing a woman who claimed she had a secret marriage with Alwaleed  provide further evidence of  Cobb âs connection to the prince.

"input: ""I know we're planning to grow weed  but working here won't just be one big party ""  Christoph Rossner  says  while striding ahead of  me  towards the entrance of a deserted nuclear bunker  in the quiet countryside of the southern German region of Allgäu.
Since March 2017  it's become legal to obtain medicinal cannabis in Germany with a prescription.  Rossner  wants to take advantage of the new law and become Germany's leading legal weed grower.  His  ambitions aren't necessarily based on delusions of grandeur – the legalisation opened up a potentially huge market. The German Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Abuse (DBDD) found that in 2015 alone  nearly five million Germans had smoked cannabis at least once that year – and that's just the people willing to admit to it.
The nuclear bunker where  Rossner  hopes to start  his  empire is an intimidating structure – 50 meters long and 15 meters high  with ventilation shafts like a medieval fortress. ""I think our plants will be pretty safe within these walls "" Roßner smiles.
Through the study   Rossner  hopes to provide 150 patients with cannabis grown in  his  bunker. If both the research and the necessary production of marijuana are approved by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Services and the Federal Narcotics Board in Germany  Bunker PPD  could start supplying clients with medicinal weed by March 2018.
On the left   Christoph Rossner  standing in  his  future weed farm. On the right  a former radio control centre.
 Rossner  is a strong believer in the healing powers of weed. When  he  was 18   his  left shoulder was crushed by a steel beam during  his  apprenticeship at an industrial mechanics company.  He  smoked to ease the chronic pain  he  was experiencing as a result of the accident  and still does to this day. The only difference now is that  he  gets  his  weed legally with a prescription. ""In case you're wondering  I'm high right now ""  he  admits.
In 1994  the Federal Constitutional Court in Germany made it legal for individuals to carry a small amount of cannabis – between five and ten grams  depending on the German region. In the late 90s  Roßner took advantage of the increased demand by setting up an illegal ""weed pharmacy"".  His  client base grew steadily and included cancer and arthritis patients. But eventually  the police came to see  him   too. In 2000   he  was sentenced to two years and one month in prison.  He  ended up spending five months there  and four months in therapy.
If at any point the power should fail  Roßner can rely on four diesel generators to supply  his  cannabis plantation with the necessary light.
But  Rossner  has a long way to go. As we step out of the bunker and back into the sunlight   he  tells me that  his  lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against the Federal Institute for Drugs. The agency is requiring potential medicinal weed producers to prove that they've already grown  processed and delivered at least 50 kilos (or 110 pounds) of cannabis within the last three years. Considering it has been illegal to produce in Germany up until now   Rossner  can't understand why the government would expect anyone to have done that – let alone kept some sort of paper trail of it.
While he's waiting for the German authorities to approve his plan   Rossner  is keeping a worried eye on  his  competitors. In the US  a number of American companies are systematically buying up smaller producers – a dynamic that could expand into and take over the German market. Even though his lab doesn't exist yet and there's nothing to buy   Rossner  already tells me he's adamant he won't be bought. He wants to do it on his own terms  in his own nuclear bunker.

And for those curious to see what the phone will look like  here's the tiniest of sneak peeks  courtesy of Razer SVP Tom Moss who had earlier last week tweeted a photo of him with CEO Tan Min Liang.

"input: This week actor Paul McGann stood amid the dirt and bricks and recited the prologue to ""Romeo and Juliet"" -- a play historians believe had its premiere on this site and in which Shakespeare may have taken a small acting role.
 ""It's possible the prologue was spoken by Shakespeare himself "" McGann said. ""I hope so. I want to channel him.""
 Shakespeare's influence on English culture is incalculable  but relatively few physical links to him remain. Tourists can visit his birth and burial places in the town of Stratford-upon-Avon. In London  there's a reconstruction of the Globe playhouse where he worked near its original site south of the River Thames. Remains have been found nearby of The Rose  another Elizabethan venue.
 It's thought plays including ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""The Merchant of Venice"" -- as well as works by Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Kyd -- were performed at The Theatre  which served as a base for Shakespeare's troupe  the Chamberlain's Men.
 But by 1598  a dispute with the site's landlord threatened to leave the company homeless. Shakespeare and his colleagues took drastic action: over the Christmas holiday  while the landlord was away  they dismantled the building and hauled its stout oak beans into storage. In the spring  the timbers were ferried across the river and used to build a new theater  the Globe.

"input: President-elect Donald Trump and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach in November 2016. (Reuters/Mike Segar)
Trumpâs commission was led by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach  who not only is the countryâs most prominent advocate of vote suppression  but also is an anti-immigration activist  which is an important part of this story. The White House issued a statement saying the president âhas asked the Department of Homeland Security to review [the commissionâs] initial findings and determine next courses of action.â
Where is the Trump administration heading now that the voter suppression commission is gone? We can get an idea from a system called Crosscheck that  Kobach  has promoted to states all over the country. That system flags anyone who has the same name and date of birth but is registered in more than one place as a possible instance of fraud.
You can immediately see the problem: There are going to be a huge number of people who share the same name and birthday  so people will get wrongly flagged constantly. Indeed  one analysis of the program found that Crosscheck risks eliminating huge numbers of registrations used to cast legitimate votes.  Kobach  sees the program as a model for what  he  wants to do nationally.
That brings us to the Department of Homeland Security. I need to stress that nobody knows exactly what theyâll be doing on this issue  because all we have are the somewhat vague statements from  Kobach  and the White House. But they have lists of immigrants and people visiting the country (like this one)  and those databases are almost certainly what  Kobach  is after.

 Opposition leader Sam Rainsy was stripped of his immunity in February after accusing Hun Sen's party of corruption during elections last year and then failing to pay a 2 500-dollar fine.

 Jim Harbaugh  didn't declare Brandon Peters as  his  starting quarterback after Saturday's win over Rutgers.
And while  he  wasn't quite ready to do it Monday   he  more or less tabbed Michigan's redshirt freshman as the starter for Saturday night's game against Minnesota.
""Brandon will play  it's likely  he 'll start ""  Harbaugh  said Monday afternoon in Ann Arbor. ""We'll see.""
Minutes earlier   Harbaugh  told reporters  he  wasn't prepared to officially name a starter for Saturday (7:30 p.m.  Fox).  He  said Michigan would prepare both Peters and fifth-year senior John O'Korn to play against the Golden Gophers  as  he  says  he  did a week ago.
When pressed   Harbaugh  said odds are Peters will be the starting quarterback this weekend.
""We're going to try to really build on what Brandon did in the ballgame  we're going into this game and we're going to prepare both quarterbacks ""  Harbaugh  said. ""Brandon's definitely going to play. The 51 percent would be on the side of him starting.
 Harbaugh  said  he  didn't want to jump the gun too fast  though  as  he 'd like to have Peters build off  his  impressive debut with a better week of practice heading into what appears to be  his  first college start.
In other words: It's all set up for  him   but Peters has to earn it this week.
""Our system is a meritocracy  where the best players play ""  Harbaugh  said. ""It was time for Brandon to play   he  went in and acquitted  himself  very well.  He  will play again this week.
""Build on the successes that  he  had in the ball game. Have a real good full week of practice.""

"input: After the Democratic presidential primaries and caucuses wrapped up last month , Bernie Sanders and his campaign team had a decision to make : pick the next goal . 
Thus far , officials with Hillary Clinton 's campaign and the DNC have been working with Sanders ' team , but the senator has n't won every fight . 
Sanders also fought for an endorsement of single-payer health care and a new tax on carbon , but the party was n't prepared to go along with these provisions , either . 
The Washington Post 's Greg Sargent noted late last week , shortly before the platform draft was released , that Sanders has won ""some big victories ,"" and that 's absolutely true . 
As of late last week , there can be little doubt that Sanders has succeeded : as MSNBC 's Alex Seitz-Wald reported , Dems are moving forward with ""what is almost certainly the most progressive platform in the party 's history ."" 
That said , as an objective matter , Sanders has had at least as much of an impact on the Democratic platform as any second-place finisher in modern times . 
And yet , over the holiday weekend , Sanders wrote an op-ed in the Philadelphia Inquirer arguing that his victories are n't enough : the platform , he said , ""needs to be significantly improved ."" 
On Wall Street , the platform lays out a number of reforms proposed by Clinton , Sanders and other Democrats , and states the party ""will not hesitate to use and expand existing authorities as well as empower regulators to downsize or break apart financial institutions ,"" it states . 
And while it 's very likely that Sanders will follow through on that commitment , it 's unclear when , exactly , he 'll start pursuing this goal . 
There can be little doubt that many of these provisions and more -- reforming the carried-interest loophole , postal banking , the industry ties of Federal Reserve board members -- can be attributed directly to the Sanders campaign 's role in negotiating the terms of the platform . 
We 'll never know for sure , but part of me wonders what the presidential race would look like right now if Sanders , once the race for the Democratic nomination wrapped up , had quickly endorsed Clinton , helped unite progressive voters , and focused his energies less on the platform and more on becoming one of the party 's leading anti-Trump voices -- all while positioning his movement as a powerful contingent in Democratic politics .

"input: Trump Uses Twitter To Criticize FBI   Deputy Director Andrew McCabe
President Trump  is once again lashing out at the FBI  mounting a Twitter attack against Deputy Director Andrew McCabe  who's planning to retire soon.
 President Trump  is celebrating Christmas in Florida  but Washington is still clearly very much on  his  mind.  He  took a few moments out of  his  break to take aim at a frequent target of  his  lately  the FBI. NPR's justice reporter Ryan Lucas has been following this and joins us now. Hey  Ryan.
FRAYER: Trump's been going after  one man in particular  Deputy Director Andrew McCabe . What can you tell us about  McCabe ?
LUCAS: Well   McCabe  is a career FBI official.  He 's been at the bureau for more than 20 years.  He  rose up through the ranks  worked a number of mob cases in New York City early on in  his  career before  he  shifted more to counterterrorism work.  He 's held senior positions at the Washington field office  at FBI headquarters in Washington.  He  was named deputy director by James Comey in January of 2016. This is the No. 2 position at the bureau. So  McCabe  was overseeing domestic and international investigations  which gave  him  a central role  of course  into the biggest and most high-profile cases of late. That would be the Clinton email server investigation and the Russia probe.  He  also  you may remember famously  stepped in as acting director after Comey was fired in May. And  McCabe  is expected to retire early next year when  he 's eligible for  his  full pension  and that's been the plan for some time.
FRAYER: So why is Trump then taking aim at  McCabe  on Twitter like he is?
LUCAS: That's right. Yes. Now  the FBI says  McCabe  cleared everything with ethics folks at the bureaus. Everything was above board. And also  McCabe  didn't become deputy director until after that election. But still  Republicans have suggested that it may have tainted  McCabe 's decision-making in the Clinton probe. And all of this  of course  is part of a broader pattern from the president and his allies of  you know  disparaging remarks directed at the FBI and the Justice Department  alleging political bias in the upper ranks of the bureau in particular and by extension  of course  with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team conducting the Russia investigation.
LUCAS: That's very much so.  McCabe  was dragged up to Capitol Hill twice last week.  He  spent around eight hours testifying behind closed doors for the House Intelligence Committee. That was about Russia. And  he  spent a little more than eight hours with the House Oversight and House Judiciary Committees a few days later talking about the Clinton matter.
LUCAS: Well  it's not a position that the bureau wants to be in. It was in the middle of the political fight in 2016  and that's continued into 2017. And there's a lot of pressure from Republicans to clean house in the senior ranks at the FBI. That's made life difficult for Christopher Wray. But one source has told me that there's not a lot of appetite at the bureau to bend to that pressure and dump  McCabe  before  he 's set to retire.

In the spring of 2016   Michael Beasley  returned to the United States after a season playing for the Shandong Golden Stars in the Chinese Basketball Association.
 He  was in Petros  Tenn. â âin the middle of nowhere â me  my wife  my kids  some animals. I had to drive 45 minutes away to a local high school to work out â  Beasley  said â and waiting for an NBA team to sign  him  for the final 6-7 weeks of the regular season.
 Beasley  had just been named international MVP of the Chinese league  averaging 31.9 points  13.4 rebounds  3.8 assists  two steals and 1.3 blocks.  He  worked hard that season ( his  second stint in China)  became a fan favorite and put  himself  in position for an NBA return.
But there wasnât much interest. âIt was heartbreaking â  he  said. âI thought in my mind after what I did in China I was going to come back to an NBA team.â
The Dallas Mavericks placed a cursory call. âThey just asked me how I felt â  Beasley  said. âI donât think it got far as interest. My perception precedes me. That phone call was just how I feel  what I think.â
In China   Beasley  came to terms with the fact that  his  NBA prospects had just about vanished. âI was like  âOh man  my NBA career could be over â â he said. âSo I stopped thinking about the NBA and started thinking about making myself a better player  a better person for my situation.
Two weeks after he returned from China  the Houston Rockets called. He knew interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff from their days with the Minnesota Timberwolves. âI wasnât thinking of Houston being a fit because of them being an analytics team â shooting three-pointers and layups â  Beasley  said. âMy whole game is mid-range. Houston wasnât on my radar at all.â

The Rockets signed him  and  Beasley  showed he can still play. Before the start of the 2016-17 season  the Milwaukee Bucks acquired him  and this past summer  the New York Knicks signed him.
âIf you love to do it  do it. Thatâs why I play basketball â  Beasley  said. âThatâs why being in China was so important. When the NBA was no longer a realistic dream  basketball kept me sane.
On Thursday   Beasley  had fans at Madison Square Garden on their feet and chanting âMVP  MVP.â In 25 minutes  he scored 32 points and collected 12 rebounds in the Knicksâ 102-93 victory against the Boston Celtics. It was his third game with 30 or more points this season.
During practices with the Bucks last season  the coaching staff didnât know who among Jabari Parker  Giannis Antetokounmpo and  Beasley  was the best scorer.
 Beasley  can still light it up. Scoring was never Beasleyâs issue. A commitment to the defensive end  maturity issues and off-the-court problems were  his  problems.
 He  has had numerous traffic  marijuana violations and a sexual assault accusation that never resulted in charges.
 He  hasnât made it easy on  himself   and  he  didnât always have it easy â as a talented teen and young NBA player  some close to  Beasley  viewed  him  as their financial aid.

"input: Not long after   John Fox  was asked about  his  faith in Barth  the kicker the Bears selected in September 2016 to replace the franchiseâs all-time leading scorer  Robbie Gould.
âWeâre in a production-based business â  Fox  said  âand thatâs what we get paid to do. Whether itâs win games as the head coach or whether itâs make kicks as a kicker. Weâll evaluate it.â
 Fox   meanwhile  is 12-30 as Bears coach  a three-season struggle that seems likely to soon lead to  his  exit as well.
Thatâs a 31 percent success rate for those into statistical metrics. And if thatâs piled on to  Fox âs .188 winning percentage in division games  his permanent residence in the NFC North basement and the reality that the Bears are now staring at a fourth-straight 10-loss season  itâs easy to understand how this production-based business may come calling for his Halas Hall key card in the next six weeks.
Late Sunday afternoon   Fox  attempted to explain why  his  Bears have had such consistent difficulty succeeding in close games. âWe have lulls â  he  said. âWe have siestas. We just donât do it for 60 minutes.â
Two long  long years ago on Thanksgiving night   Fox  and the Bears seemed to have their wick lit for a franchise-boosting takeoff. They went to Lambeau Field in prime time and snatched a 17-13 upset. But it wasnât just a road win over the rival Packers that had the sense of belief soaring. At the time  it was the Bearsâ fifth win in eight games  a surge that spoke of a team figuring out how to win consistently.
Under  Fox   the Bears have experienced seven losing streaks of three games or longer and have never won three in a row.

"input: PORTO ALEGRE  Brazil (Reuters) - A Brazilian appeals court upheld the corruption conviction of  former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  on Wednesday  a major blow to the plans of the countryâs most influential politician to run for the presidency again this year.
The first two of three judges voted to uphold  Lula âs convictions on taking bribes and money laundering and agreed with the prosecutorsâ request to lengthen the prison sentence of Brazilâs first working-class leader  who remains free pending future appeals.
 Lula   72  could now be ineligible to stand for election under Brazilâs âFicha Limpaâ or âClean Recordâ law  which bans political candidates whose convictions are upheld by an appelate court. However  an electoral court must make the final ruling on a candidacy  and would only do so once a candidate had registered.
 Lula  can appeal Wednesdayâs decision to higher courts to delay a final decision  possibly avoiding jail and stringing the process out long enough to register  his  candidacy by the Aug. 15 deadline.
 Lula  is one of scores of powerful politicians and businessmen caught up in sweeping corruption probes that have wracked the Brazilian establishment since 2014.
 His  exclusion from the election would radically alter the political landscape ahead of a campaign in which  Lula  is the early favorite  with 36 percent of voter preferences according to pollster Datafolha. That is double the percentage of  his  nearest rival  the far-right congressman and former army captain Jair Bolsonaro  who has been energized by anti-Lula sentiment.
Brazilâs benchmark Bovespa stock index has risen 8 percent so far this year  propped up by expectations  Lula  will be barred from the election  clearing the way for a more market-friendly candidate who would stick to Brazilâs austerity agenda.
The Bovespa hit an all-time high on Wednesday as the first of three judges on the court began reading his decision  dismissing a series of arguments presented by  Lula âs lawyers.

 Lula  faces six other indictments in corruption cases ranging from receiving bribes from engineering firm Odebrecht to obstructing justice and trafficking  his  influence to obtain government decisions favoring the auto industry.
 He  is among over 100 people convicted in the âCar Washâ investigation  the most sprawling of Brazilâs numerous probes  focused on graft involving oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro and other state-run companies.
Speaking at a union rally on the outskirts of Sao Paulo on Wednesday   Lula  told the crowd  âI committed no crime.â
âThe only fair decision today would be a 3-0 ruling that I was wrongly convicted and sentenced â  Lula  said.
 Lula  was convicted of corruption and money laundering last year for accepting a beachside apartment from an engineering firm vying for contracts with the state oil company known as Petrobras.
Prosecutors said the apartment and its refurbishing was a bribe worth 3.7 million reais ($1.1 million).  Lula  maintains  he  never owned the penthouse apartment  criticizing prosecutors for relying on the plea bargain testimony of one witness  businessman Leo Pinheiro.
â His  word is not enough to incriminate  Lula  â Lulaâs lawyer Cristiano Zanin told the appeals court.

"input: Serena Williams  discussed the harrowing complications  she  suffered during ― and after ― the birth of  her  daughter  Alexis Olympia  in a revealing new interview for Vogue’s February issue.
 Williams  said  her  pregnancy was relatively easy  but the complications began when  her  daughter was born via C-section after Williams’ heart rate dropped. The next day the tennis great  who has a history of blood clots  told doctors  she  was having a pulmonary embolism (blockage that occurs in the lungs  usually due to blood clots). Sure enough  CT scans showed blood clots in  her  lungs and  she  began treatment.
The health scares didn’t stop there. Over the next few days  Williams was back in surgery after one of  her  C-section scars popped open after  she  experienced coughing spells. Doctors found a hematoma in  her  abdomen  and  she  returned to the operating table for one more procedure to prevent clotting.
Vogue/Mario Testino ""Sometimes I get really down and feel like  man  I can’t do this ”  she  told the magazine.
After going through all of that  Williams told  Vogue   she  couldn’t get out of bed for six weeks. And once  she  began recovering   she  said  she  found out just how challenging motherhood can be.
 She  added  “I’ve broken down I don’t know how many times. Or I’ll get angry about the crying  then sad about being angry  and then guilty  like  why do I feel so sad when I have a beautiful baby? The emotions are insane.”
Some days  Williams admitted  she  feels like throwing in the towel.
“To be honest  there’s something really attractive about the idea of moving to San Francisco and just being a mom ”  she  said. Williams’ husband  Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian  is based there  while  she  lives in Florida.
“But not yet ”  she  added. “Maybe this goes without saying  but it needs to be said in a powerful way: I absolutely want more Grand Slams.”

"input: Tesla  is finding  it 's a long hard road out of production hell.
 The electric car maker  relieved some investors and customers when  it  said  it  is sticking to  its  latest Model 3 production targets. But some analysts still question exactly where  Tesla  is in  its  production ramp and are concerned that  its  targets may be too aggressive.
""The data point everyone wants  we didn't get â current Model 3 run rate "" RBC analyst Joseph Spak said in a note Wednesday after  the company  reported earnings that beat analyst expectations.
 Tesla  had originally aimed to be making 5 000 Model 3 cars per week by the end of 2017  but  the company  has changed that deadline twice. On Wednesday   the company  reiterated reaching 5 000 by the end of the second quarter and set a smaller goal of 2 500 per week by the end of the first quarter.
 Tesla  also acknowledged battery production issues at  its  Gigafactory in Sparks  Nevada.  It  said  it  has created automatic assembly lines to resolve the problem  but the lines are in Germany  and they need to be disassembled  shipped and reassembled in Nevada.
 Tesla  expects that to happen before the end of the quarter.
In the meantime  parts of  its  assembly line have been ""semiautomatic "" meaning people are filling in gaps on the line.  Tesla  ultimately wants to automate as much of  its  assembly lines as possible.
"" We  view the 2 500 target in March  in particular  as extremely aggressive due to management's acknowledgment of needing to get the robotic equipment in Germany disassembled  shipped to the US  and then reassembled and programmed in order to hit roughly 2 000 to 2 500 units per week "" Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne said in a note Thursday.
There is also a production constraint at  Tesla 's automated material conveyance system in the company's factory in Fremont  California  but CEO Elon Musk said improving that system ""appears to be on track.""
Tesla shares were down 2 percent in early trading Thursday.

"input: Nearly 10 months Â­after a federal probe into Mayor  de Blasioâs  fund-raising practices was closed  the city on Friday disclosed that his legal bills will cost taxpayers $2.6 million.
Thatâs what  Hizzonerâs  personal law firm  Kramer Levin Naftalis and Frankel LLP  is charging to defend the mayor during a yearlong probe by the Manhattan US Attorneyâs Office into whether his campaign donors got special treatment from City Hall.
The probe concluded in March 2017 with no charges filed  even as prosecutors noted that  de Blasio  had âmade or directed inquiries to relevant city agencies on behalf of those donors.â
âI want to affirm I did try to go a different route  â de Blasio  said on WNYC radio in July. âAnd I thought a lot about it and I came to the conclusion it just didnât make sense  that the consistent and appropriate thing is any employee who has not done anything wrong and obviously not as you said â clear  not indicted  etc. â deserves legal representation from the city of New York.â
 De Blasio  still plans to use a legal defense fund to pay for the expenses stemming from that probe  city officials said.

"input: President Trump  is at a crossroads with regard to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program  or DACA  the Obama-era initiative  the president  just rescinded that protected nearly 800 000 undocumented individuals who came to the U.S. when they were young. And instead of picking one path to go down   he  seems to be trying to jog down both sides at once  which has brought fury and confusion to those on all sides of this debate.
 Trump  seems to have gotten the message and responded with reassuring tweets meant to placate  his  enraged base.
But  the president  also doesn't seem to want to alienate Democrats on the issue and come across as cold-hearted for going after young immigrants  many of whom only remember life in the U.S. So  as  he  boarded Marine One on  his  way to survey hurricane damage in Florida Thursday   he  reassured reporters  he 's still committed to finding a way to reinstate some variation of the very program  he  just nixed.
King comes from a sprawling Iowa district  where he says many of his constituents will stand by  Trump  despite the unpopular positions he may take – up to a point.
""There's a certain  Trump  base that  they will never leave him for anything – they've proved that – provided he maintains his position on immigration "" King says. ""I think there's one thing that will destroy his base  and that's amnesty.""
Other conservatives fear the deal-maker-in-chief has become enamored by the positive coverage he received last week for undercutting GOP leaders and striking a bipartisan deal with Democrats on a massive economic package. That's why they're warning  Trump  not to forget who put  him  in the White House.
""The  Trump  voter is not in favor of amnesty "" Republican Rep. Mark Meadows  the leader of the far-right House Freedom Caucus  tells Rolling Stone. ""That is a very complex issue but certainly is one that we're not going to solve in one dinner with two Democrats.""
Still  it seems Republican leaders have once again been sidelined by  Trump   who is angry at them for failing to carry through on the party's promise to repeal and replace Obamacare or send him any meaningful bills to sign.
But Democratic leaders say the president has paved the way for resolving the bipartisan issue. They think  Trump  is honestly in their corner  even while  he  tries to navigate  his  hardline anti-immigration supporters  which is resulting in mixed signals on Twitter  in interviews and in private phone calls.
""The base had a pretty strong reaction yesterday and that may have been it  but still  he  said good things about DACA too "" Dick Durbin  the number-two Democrat in the Senate  tells Rolling Stone. ""It's still an active negotiation  and I have a positive feeling towards it. We're not there yet.""
When asked if Pelosi and Schumer should trust  Trump  in negotiations  many Democrats say they shouldn't.
""I wouldn't  no "" Democrat Rep. Raul Grijalva  a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus  tells Rolling Stone. ""There's a historical context to  Trump  and immigration and immigrants that I think always has to be in the front of your mind.""

"input: The attack  at least initially  was as inexplicable as it was horrifying. Law enforcement officials said they could not immediately tell what drove  Stephen Paddock  to fire at thousands of unsuspecting concertgoers from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino before killing  himself .
Authorities said a sweep of law enforcement databases showed  Paddock  had no known run-ins with police  and â despite the Islamic Stateâs repeated claims otherwise â investigators also could not find any connections to international terrorist groups. He was the son of a notorious bank robber and his own crime demonstrated some amount of sophisticated planning.
Police said  he  stayed in a large hotel suite for several days and aroused no suspicion  bringing with  him  an arsenal of 23 guns â their calibers ranging from .223 to .308  some with scopes â authorities said. One of the weapons  he  apparently used in the attack was an AK-47 type rifle  with a stand used to steady it for firing  people familiar with the case said.  He  fired  without warning  from an elevated position on an open-air venue  leaving  his  victims few options to avoid harm.
Stephen Paddock was identified by police as the gunman in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Here's what you need to know about him. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)
[Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock enjoyed gambling  country music  lived quiet life before massacre]
Police and hotel security ultimately scoured several floors of the hotel looking for the shooter and came upon Paddockâs suite  Lombardo said. At some point   Paddock  fired through the door and hit a security guard in the leg   he  said  adding that the guard is expected to survive. SWAT officers ultimately stormed the room and some fired shots  though  Paddock  is believed to have killed  himself   Lombardo said. He was not counted in the death toll that authorities reported.
Eric Paddock  Stephen Paddockâs brother  said he was stunned to learn that his brother could be responsible for such violence.
Stephen Paddock had no history of mental illness nor did he have problems with drugs or alcohol  Eric Paddock said  noting that his brother was a high-stakes gambler  sometimes wagering hundreds of dollars on a single hand of video poker.
Eric Paddock said his brother was âwealthy â in part because he had no children to support. Stephen Paddock had worked in the past as an accountant  and he had real estate investments in the Orlando area  Eric Paddock said.
Relatives said Stephen Paddock  a licensed pilot who owned two airplanes  was a quiet man who often went to Las Vegas to gamble and view concerts. In a statement  Lockheed Martin  the defense giant  said that Paddock worked for them for three years in the 1980s.
 A former neighbor of Stephen Paddockâs  recalled that  his  home in a 55-and-over community in Florida looked more akin to a college freshmanâs dorm  with nothing on the walls and only a few pieces of furniture.

 The star  made the announcement on Instagram with a heartfelt note to  her  fans and followers that both explained the reasons  she  chose to keep  her  pregnancy a secret and announced the birth of  her  first daughter with rapper Travis Scott. The duo had been dating for only about five months before rumors that they were expecting a child together surfaced in September 2017. Now   she  has confirmed him to be the father after months of rare silence from the reality TV and social media personality.

 Jenner  also attached am 11-minute video diary that  for the first time  showed  her  pregnant and openly discussing having a baby with friends and family. It also gives some details as to the journey  she  took both in finding out and how it affected  her  future.
One of the most potent moments came with Kim Kardashian  who just had her third child  via a surrogate  with Kanye West. The sisters bond over the new baby while Kim explains what  Kylie  can expect to happen to  her  body soon.
Prior to the big reveal  fans noticed that  Jenner  had only been posting older photos of  herself  on social media or images that were cropped to omit what people now know to be  her  visibly pregnant figure.
In the video   Jenner  has  her  friends discuss both the progression of  her  relationship with Scott as well as how they found out that  she  was pregnant. Fans of the Kardashian family were also treated to some rare footage from the moment Kris Jenner gave birth to  Kylie . The footage  which opens the below video  appears to have been shot by  her  father  Caitlyn Jenner  who at the time identified as Bruce Jenner.
The announcement comes a little more than a month after  Kylie âs sister  Khloe Kardashian  revealed her pregnancy on Instagram as well.

"input: The Washington Post this morning piggybacks off a FOIA investigation by the AP ( nice job !) about why “ getting into prestigious Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology   a magnet school that routinely sends graduates to the most competitive colleges  ” can be extremely difficult   unless of course you can afford to file appeals   “ armed with private exams costing more than $ 500   to persuade bureaucrats their child is deserving ” of admission to the top regional school nicknamed “ TJ .” The problem ? ( bolding added by me for emphasis ) … This system exacerbates a problem plaguing gifted - and - talented programs across the nation : Black and Hispanic students almost never file the appeals that can secure their admission . Using the Virginia Freedom of Information Act to obtain 10 years of county records   The Associated Press found that fewer than 50 black and Hispanic second - graders have filed successful appeals . That ’ s less than 3 percent of the 1   737 second - graders admitted through the appeals process   further skewing a program already heavily weighted toward whites and Asians . Fairfax County has the nation ’ s 10th largest public school system   with more than 188   000 students . Of those   25 percent are Hispanic and 10 percent are African - American . But over the last 10 years   blacks and Hispanics have constituted only 12 percent of the students deemed eligible for Level IV   the most advanced academic program . There are just a few dozen black students at Thomas Jefferson   where sophomore  Alina Ampeh  is surrounded by whites and Asians — a situation  she  ’ s lived with since elementary school .  She  ’ s grateful that all those years of advanced classes prepared  her  for TJ ’ s rigorous academics   but says that doesn ’ t necessarily make  her  special :  She  thinks many of  her  classmates simply have parents who worked the system . So yeah   this situation is unacceptable and in dire need of immediate correction . But not according to commenters on the Washington Post article   who respond with a torrent of racist idiocy that   among other things   clearly violates the Post ’ s own “ standards ” for commenting . For instance   check out the top - rated (!) comments like the following   all of which are racist and / or ignorant and / or just plain nasty . “ Just a shot in the dark – People from either 1 ) a non - English speaking background   or 2 ) a culture where achievement and effort is equated with being a “ sellout ” or an “ Oreo cookie ”  will probably always be “ underrepresented ” in any gifted program .” “ Racial bias ? Blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented in gifted programs in northern Virginia   and in fact   nation - wide   because   on average   they are not as academically - inclined / interested as white or Asian students . And no amount of public monies spent on special racially - targeted programs just for them is going to materially impact that fact . Of course   until the percentage of Blacks and Hispanics in gifted programs matches their percentage of the total student body the SJWs at the WAPO will continue to dissemble and lie about the reasons for the disparity because that ’ s what they do .” “ Could it be that some culture are underrepresented because they lack sufficient households that emphasize a strict and intense work ethic ?” “ Any chance they aren ’ t as gifted as other students ? Nah   it couldn ’ t be that .” “ Probably for the same reasons whites and asians are underrepresented in the NBA .” It goes on and on like this   with no sign of a ( Com ) Post moderator in sight to enforce the “ standards ” of Jeff Bezos ’ fine newspaper . Just for comparison purposes   racist comments would be immediately deleted here at Blue Virginia and the commenters banned . Of course   then again   we also follow other principles of journalistic ethics – like linking to original sources   giving credit / attribution   etc . – that the corporate media rarely seems to care about in its race for eyeballs / clicks / etc . By the way   Sen . Scott Surovell ( D - Fairfax / Prince William County ) has been a leader on this issue ( thank you ! )  for instance with his SB787 that would have required – if it hadn ’ t been defeated in committee – Thomas Jefferson H . S . “ to accept for enrollment ( i ) a sufficient number of students eligible to receive free or reduced price meals such that the total of such students is at least 50 percent of the weighted average of the participating divisions ’ percentage of such students in the previous school year and ( ii ) at least five students but no more than 15 students from each middle school in each school division eligible to matriculate students to such Governor ’ s school who have completed at least two full years at such middle school .” Here ’ s what Sen . Surovell had to say about the WaPo article on “ TJ ” this morning . Last week   5 letters to the editor attacking my TJ admissions bill arguing that TJ is all about “ merit ” and that we just need to do a better job educating Black and Latino kids : Most of the time Merit = Wealth and having the time and ability to work your child to the right spot in the system – e . g . parents working the “ gifted and talented ” appeal process for their second graders as the AP just confirmed . Why can ’ t more leaders be honest about the shortfalls in our system ? Great question ; any answers ? More to the point   what is Fairfax County – or the Virginia General Assembly – planning to do about this situation ?

California State Assembly "" Instead of tackling the real issues   today ' s California Democrats are more interested in giving jail time to waiters offering their customers the convenience of having a straw  "" Allen told ABC News on Monday . "" This is one absurd bill   but it highlights how ridiculous the California Democrats have gotten . This is clearly the last straw ."" Paul Preston said such laws are the reason he co - founded a movement to break up the state and form a New California   where regulations aren ' t overbearing and discouraging to businesses . "" It ' s absolute lunacy  "" Preston told ABC News of  Calderon  ' s bill . "" They are criminalizing everything we do . It ' s over the top .""  Calderon  brushed off the bashing   saying an estimated 500 million plastic straws are used every day in the United States and most are just used once and discarded .  He  said plastic straws and stirrers were the sixth most common items collected during California Coastal Cleanup Days between 1989 and 2014 . "" We need to create awareness around the issue of one - time use of plastic straws and its detrimental effects on our landfills   waterways and oceans  "" Calderon said . STOCK PHOTO / Getty Images He said he ' ll work to get the bill ' s language rewritten so that no one fears going to jail or paying hefty fines for handing out plastic straws . He said he expects the bill to reach Gov . Jerry Brown ' s desk for approval in about two months . "" Nobody is going to jail   nobody is going to be getting a $ 1   000 fine  "" said Calderon   adding that the bill does not affect fast - food restaurants or grocery stores . He said critics like Allen are "" grasping at straws "" by saying such legislation is hurting businesses in California . "" It ' s a ridiculous argument  "" he said . Sharokina Shams -- a spokeswoman for the California Restaurant Association   which represents more than 20   000 restaurants in the state -- told ABC News her group is taking a wait - and - see approach on  Calderon  ' s bill . "" The association will study the bill ' s potential impacts and consult with its membership before taking an officials stance on the bill  "" said Shams   adding that  Calderon  ' s proposal "" is preferable to an outright ban on straws ."" Matt Davis   a spokesman for the national environmental group Clean Water Action   said Calderon ' s proposal makes sense . "" It ' s great he ' s doing it  "" Davis told ABC News . "" It does reduce the amount of straws that restaurants are giving out and that ' s a good thing ."" He said cities such as Alameda   California   have passed local straws - on - request ordinances and that many restaurants have saved money by not having to provide so many straws . He compared it to the plastic shopping bag ban passed by California voters in 2016 or water - on - request ordinances used to combat the state ' s drought   saying people got used to it . In New Jersey   too   local businesses have been participating in an initiative to reduce plastic straw use . And it has dramatically reduced the number of straws the companies are giving out   according to the Montclair Local .

"input: It all started last Christmas. The Mall of America had hired a black Santa Claus  and the internet was having a meltdown. In response   humor writer Daniel Kibblesmith  tweeted that when  he  and  his  wife have children   he 'll tell them that Santa is black and when they see a white Santa  that  he  is Santa's husband.
""We would have this extremely woke baby who was open to a Santa Claus with all kinds of orientations  "" Kibblesmith  told me  half joking.
But of course  Kibblesmith and Quach have faced a lot of trolling for their status quo-challenging art;  Kibblesmith  says  he  even found  his  picture on a white supremacist's blog trying to ""out""  him  as Jewish. VICE spoke with  Kibblesmith  about the various politically-minded themes  he  and Quach sneaked into their innocuous-enough children's book  and what  he 's learned from the troubling and all-too-predictable online reaction to Santa's Husband.
 Daniel Kibblesmith : We see  it  as an all ages book; in stores  it  will be in the humor section. But our goal was to write something that any kind of family could theoretically enjoy at Christmas time  on any level. Maybe you're a childless couple who has these politics and thinks the book is charming and funny; maybe you're a new parent who wants to introduce a different kind of holiday tradition into your home  or just reinforce the idea that traditions like these are malleable  living things that every family interprets differently.

 Halawa  who was born and raised in Dublin and is a son of the most senior Muslim cleric in Ireland   was 17 when  he  was arrested along with hundreds of others in 2013 as part of a crackdown on protests in Egypt.
The defendants had all faced the death penalty and though none received it  hundreds were given hefty jail sentences.  Halawa ’s sisters were released shortly after their arrests.
 Halawa  has said  he  was regularly tortured during  his  period in detention. The Egyptian authorities have repeatedly denied allegations of abuses from rights groups.

"input: Chris Pratt  took to social media Monday to urge  his  followers to pray for Kevin Smith after the filmmaker suffered a serious heart attack Sunday night â only to be attacked by commenters who mocked the actor and questioned whether prayer was an effective way to respond to the health scare.
The 38-year-old Guardians of the Galaxy star and openly religious Christian wrote Monday on Twitter that though  he  hardly knew Smith   he  is a fan of  his  work and was praying for  him  to make a full recovery.
The comments were among several by users who slammed  Pratt  for his initial tweet.
Also joining in to defend  Pratt  was his Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn.
âIâm not tweeting this to defend  Chris  â heâs a big boy and can take care of himself â Gunn wrote in a series of nine tweets. âBut for me  personally  prayer and meditation are great boons to my life and help me navigate my way through this world  and I donât want to dissuade others who find those things useful.â
So I just read Chris Prattâs tweet to Kevin Smith saying he would pray for him & made the mistake of reading the comments  many of which go off on  Chris  for saying heâd pray. I think people misunderstand the backlash against âthoughts & prayers.â (thread) â James Gunn (@JamesGunn) February 26  2018

"input: For years   Bill Akins  fought to capitalize on  his  idea - with the U.S. government   his  former business partner and a rival competitor - but found  himself  stymied at every turn.
The 63-year-old Marine veteran and Elvis impersonator voiced  his  sorrow at the tragedy in Las Vegas  where authorities said Stephen Paddock had bump stocks installed on 12 of his rifles. The device allows semi-automatic weapons to fire almost as rapidly as machine guns  which are largely outlawed.
“I would like to express my dismay and sincere condolences to the victims  families and anyone affected by the recent Las Vegas mass shooting ”  Akins  said during a telephone interview from  his  home about 45 minutes north of Tampa  Florida.
But  he  also defended the devices as protected under the U.S. Constitution’s right to bear arms.
“People need to recognize that we either have a constitution  or we don‘t ”  he  said.
 Akins  first came up with  his  idea while watching a documentary about World War Two in 1996 that showed twin anti-aircraft guns firing at Japanese warplanes from a U.S. Navy ship.
 He  saw the barrels sliding back and forth with each concussive recoil and wondered if  he  could design a device that would mimic that action  turning a semi-automatic rifle that fires once per trigger pull into a weapon capable of shooting hundreds of rounds per minute.
The result  which  he  eventually termed the “Akins Accelerator ” seemed promising enough. Akins teamed up with a firearms industry businessman  secured two letters from the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  Firearms and Explosives (ATF) affirming the mechanism behind the device was legal  and poured his savings into the project.
Another company  Slide Fire Solutions  began making its own version of the bump stock that was approved by the ATF  in large part because it lacked a recoil spring that  Akins  had included.
 Akins  transferred  his  patent to an outdoor sporting goods company  FosTecH Outdoors  and the two rival manufacturers engaged in a legal battle over patent infringement before settling the case in 2012.
 Akins  is limited in what  he  can say about the litigation  saying only that  he  is “legally prevented” from discussing certain aspects of the bump stock industry. But  he  made clear  his  ire at the ATF.
“They just destroyed our business ”  he  said.
 Akins  put up  his  own property as collateral for a loan to launch the business.  He  estimated  he  sold several hundred devices  priced at more than $1 000 each  before  he  was shut down - not enough to cover  his  startup costs.
 He  filed two unsuccessful federal lawsuits against the ATF  leaving  him  with a workshop full of unused Akins Accelerators.
“Boy  did I get an education ”  he  said. “I‘m not a person who’d ever done business before with a corporation  never worked in the firearm industry before  just a tinkerer that came up with an idea.”

According to a White House source   Schumer  arrived in the Oval Office and presented the president with a list of demands on domestic issues that went well beyond just DACA.

She did find  however  that St. Frances de Chantal Church improperly doled out over $22 000 in personal reimbursements to  Miqueli  from parish accounts. The disgraced ex-priest was ordered to return the funds  Clark said.
""This investigation by the Economic Crimes Bureau found that  Father Miqueli  was improperly reimbursed for personal expenses "" Clark said. ""The Archdiocese has reimbursed St. Frances de Chantal Church for the funds  $22 450 of hard-earned money donated by parishioners for the betterment of the parish. We have made recommendations to the Archdiocese and they have agreed to more oversight.""
In a letter that was disseminated to parishioners  Most Rev. Gerald Walsh  vicar for clergy  said that while $22 000 is a ""significant sum "" it is a ""far cry"" from the millions  Miqueli  was accused of looting.
""The Archdiocese has attempted to investigate the other  more sensational  accusations of morally abhorrent behavior  but  to date  nothing has been brought forward to substantiate them  and  Father Miqueli  continues to deny them.""

"input: Forget the Winter Olympics  the Champion's League or the Super Bowl. The real competition right now is who's going to be invited to  Prince Harry  and Meghan Markle's wedding.
British heavyweight boxer Anthony Joshua  who is seeking to add two more world championships to the three he already owns  says he would be happy to interrupt his high-level training for a trip to Windsor Castle on May 19. The ebullient Joshua has not been shy  tweeting a picture of himself and Harry with the question ""Need a best man?""
Any bride and groom run into parental interference in their guest list  whether it's adding random cousins or forgotten neighbors. Yet  Harry  and Markle are enduring this phenomenon at a cosmic level due to the royal expectations that come along with being a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II.
At least  Harry  and Markle won't face the 3 500 guests that  his  parents  Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer  welcomed to their 1981 ""wedding of the century"" in St. Paul's Cathedral in London. They also avoided the warehouse-sized Westminster Abbey  where Harry's brother Prince William and Kate Middleton packed in 1 900 guests for a 2011 royal wedding extravaganza televised around the world.
The British royals' close relatives alone number over 50 â and this time Princess Eugenie gets to bring a plus-one  fiance Jack Brooksbank.  Harry  also won't forget non-royals like Kate's sister  Pippa Middleton  her husband James Mathews  and brother James Middleton.
William barely could squeeze in A-listers like David Beckham and TV adventure host Ben Fogle â who may return for  Harry 's nuptials.
The juiciest debate has been over invites for rival U.S. presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump.  Harry  and Obama have obvious chemistry and have worked together promoting  Harry 's Invictus Games competition for wounded soldiers. Some British officials  however  fear that an invite to Obama would anger Trump.
The royals could note that Obama  the U.S. president in 2011  was not invited to William's wedding. And they have a bit more leeway because  Harry 's wedding is not considered a state event. Markle  meanwhile  is a Hillary Clinton fan.
""We've changed our minds on this. We think  Harry  is in a position that  he  does not have to worry about the political implications of an invite "" said Rupert Adams  a spokesman for the betting agency William Hill PLC. ""We feel strongly that the Obamas will get an invite.""
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a trifecta of ties to the bride and groom: He's the head of a Commonwealth country  host of  Harry 's latest Invictus Games and leader of the nation where Markle had been living.
On the celebrity front  Elton John  who turned his song ""Candle in the Wind"" into an anthem for the late Princess Diana  is considered a 1-50 lock for an invite (98 percent chance) and singer James Blunt comes in at 1-4. Singer/songwriter Ed Sheeran is also reportedly close to  Harry 's royal cousins and his U.K. tour doesn't start until a few days later.
Violet von Westenholz who introduced the couple will get a nod  along with  Harry 's buddies Thomas and Charlie van Straubenzee  Thomas Inskip and Arthur Landon.
Yet A-listers could find themselves outnumbered by British military members and charity workers. Look for dress uniforms from both the Blues and Royals regiment and the Army Air Corps  since  Harry  served as a former Apache helicopter co-pilot in Afghanistan.
""The simple reality is ... we have been focusing on Harry over here "" Adams said.

"input: Itâs not as if fake news in America came into existence alongside the tide known as the Trump presidencyâthe hucksters  foreign propagandists  conspiracy theorists  and fabricators have always been hereâbut if ever there was a year when purposefully misleading or false stories hit their stride  2017 might have been it.  We  were told that an ISIS leader was captured at a US airport  and that Shariah law was instituted in Utah and other states. A study found that 25 million votes for Hillary Clinton were âcompletely fraudulent â and the Las Vegas massacre was carried out by antifa  or ISIS  or the Illuminati  or somehow all three. The lies went on and on  picking up where 2016âs catalogue of nonsense left off. (Remember Hillary Clintonâs child sex trafficking ring run out of a pizzeria  or Sarah Palin banning Muslims from âenteringâ her daughter? How about Alec Baldwin dying  and Trump winning the electoral vote and the popular vote?)
But now  we âre at the dawn of a fresh year  privy to the forces that seek to sow confusion and outrage. Can American society overcome the fake news phenomenon?
Wellâ¦ âThereâs probably a strong case to be made that  we  are chemically addicted to fake news â says  Amy Webb   an author and futurist who founded the Future Today Institute. âWhen youâre seeing your angers and fears and anxieties being validated externally  you get a shot of dopamine.â Thinking about the upcoming year and beyond   she  says   we  may have âa huge problem on  our  hands.â And though the propaganda is coming at  us  from all directionsâfrom Kremlin-backed misinformation campaigns and Twitter troll armies to publicity hounds and political malcontentsâfalling for it  and spreading it  is to some degree our own fault.
In the spring of 2017   Webb  wrote a piece for Mother Jones that detailed not only the manner of 21st-century fake news and the speed with which it travels  but also how we are all accomplices to its proliferation âas we click and repost without considering the storyâs source and its agenda.â  She  noted that the democratization of the internet back in the 1990s meant that âeveryone would get to participate regardless of their agendas.â Information became free and free-flowing. But  problematically  âwe didnât plan ahead as the internet matured â when consumers of information were left to contend with not only âhuman arbiters of factsâ but also code and algorithms that propel certain types of content to the fore  based on our own online behavior. Innocently sharing a cat video put out by Russia Today  a Kremlin-backed propaganda machine that elevates fringe âexpertsâ and attempts to sow distrust  means youâll see a lot more of their content in the future.
Complicating matters more is that in our politicized climate  the term fake news itself came to mean different things to different people. It had a literal meaning that  seemingly overnight  became a hashtag and an epithet to hurl at anything or anyone that one disagrees with. âIf we canât even come to some kind of convergence and talk about something as insidious and as threatening to our future as the spread of misinformationâotherwise known as fake news in the literal senseâthen donât we have sort of a catastrophically huge problem on our hands?â asks  Webb .
As someone who studies current and past trends to try to anticipate what the future may hold   Webb  likes to end these conversations with a reminder that  for however doomed things appear  âWe are not living in the middle of Westworldâthe future has not been preordained. There is something we can do in the year 2018 and beyond  and that is be smarter consumers of news.â

"input: Beirut (AFP) â Syrian troops and allied militiamen entered  the jihadist-held town of Albu Kamal  on Wednesday  state media said  edging closer to ousting the Islamic State group from its last urban stronghold in the country.
 Albu Kamal  lies on the Syrian side of the border with Iraq  in the oil-rich eastern province of Deir Ezzor.
Entry to  Albu Kamal  follows a series of stunningly quick defeats for IS in the province as well as the jihadistsâ loss of their de facto capital Raqa further north.
âArmy troops and allied forces broke through Daesh (IS) defences and entered Albu Kamal  waging fierce battles inside  the town  â state news agency SANA reported.
Syrian regime forces  backed by intensive Russian air strikes  have steadily advanced on  Albu Kamal  from the south and west for weeks.
âThe advance towards  Albu Kamal  came after army troops and their allies met up with Iraqi forces at the border between the two countries â SANA said.
A source from militias allied to Damascus told AFP that fighters from Lebanonâs pro-regime Hezbollah movement had advanced to the southern edges of  Albu Kamal  on Wednesday.
âPart of those units crossed into Iraq  with the help of Hashed al-Shaabi units  to circle around  Albu Kamal  and reach the northern side of the town â the source added.
But the jihadist group has seen that territory shrink to a small pocket along the Euphrates River  with  Albu Kamal  as  its  final hub.
In recent weeks  an estimated 120 000 people have been displaced from  Albu Kamal  alone  said Linda Tom from the United Nationsâ humanitarian affairs coordination office in Damascus.

"input: Walter Pidgeon   the courtly actor who distinguished  his  47-year career with portrayals of men who prove both sturdy and wise  died yesterday at a hospital in Santa Monica  Calif. He was 87 years old and had suffered a series of strokes.
 Walter Pidgeon  was born September 23  1897 in the city of St. John  New Brunswick  Canada. The New Brunswick schools paid attention to  his   his  splendid singing voice and that inspired a glimmer for the stage.  He  went to the University of New Brunswick to study law and dramatics classes there affirmed  his  theatrical ambitions.
World War I  however  prompted  him  to enlist in the Canadian army. Before  he  could see action   he  was trapped between two rolling gun carriages in France and was hospitalized for 17 months.
After the war   he  found work as a Boston bank runner  but found  he  did not like banking and moved to New York. According to a studio biography   he  walked in to the office of English actor and producer E.E. Clive and said  he  could act and sing and could prove it.
 He  made  his  debut in ''You Never Can Tell'' and  growing a mustache  starred in Broadway productions of ''The Mannequin '' ''Something Gay'' and ''There's Wisdom in Women.'' Teamed With Garson
In 1926  ''Mannequin'' was made into a film and Mr. Pidgeon's role there was  his  introduction to movies. Mr. Pidgeon was dissatisfied with the preponderance of singing roles and during that period intermittently left Hollywood for Broadway.
In 1939   he  made  his  first film with Miss Garson  ''Blossoms in the Dust'' and  his  career seemed to soar. With Miss Garson  there followed ''Mrs. Miniver '' ''Madame Curie '' ''Mrs. Parkington '' ''Julie Misbehaves '' ''That Forsythe Woman '' ''The Miniver Story'' and ''Scandal at Scourie.''

"input: It profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world... but for  Trump ’s base?
If Sir Thomas More were alive today  that’s what he might say about congressional Republicans who gave their political souls in exchange for  Trump ’s support because they thought they needed it to be reelected. They have been held hostage by  Trump ’s popularity with  his  base and  his  grip on the swing vote. But after last week  that grip looks a lot looser.
It remains to be seen whether they have learned it  but the lesson for Republicans from their losses in Virginia  New Jersey and across the country should be clear: they don’t need to placate  Trump  to keep their seats. Senators Jeff Flake and Bob Corker decided not to run for another term because they weren’t willing to cozy up to  the president  and thought they couldn’t win without doing so. Perhaps they’ll reconsider that now.
 Trump’s  coattails were never long to begin with  and are now fraying. The 2016 election was decided by just 0.09 percent of all votes cast. A total of 107 000 votes gave Trump Michigan  Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and the presidency.  He  won in those states and Florida  by less than 2 percent.
 Trump  still has strong support from  his  base  with the latest CNN poll showing 85 percent of Republicans approve of  him . In stark contrast  only 20 percent approved of Republican congressional leaders as of late September.  Trump ’s blaming them for failure to pass legislation apparently worked  which may help explain why they have been so deferential to such a dysfunctional president.
They’ve even gone so far as to introduce a resolution asking special counsel Robert Mueller to recuse himself from investigating whether  Trump ’s campaign colluded with Russia. This is pure political kowtowing  flying in the face of the Manafort and Gates indictments  the Papadopoulos plea and the targeting of Flynn.
The question is  will congressional Republicans continue to appease  Trump  given the 2017 election results? Or will more of them stand up to  him ?
Will they continue to tolerate  Trump’s  unprecedented conflicts of interest?  He  holds stakes in roughly 500 international businesses  many in countries where  he  must negotiate trade and other agreements. The conflicts are so serious that the Office of Government Ethics director couldn’t abide them and resigned  while Republicans just stood pat.
Will they challenge  Trump’s  cascade of lies  such as “I have nothing to do with Russia…no person that I deal with does”? What about Paul Manafort  Donald Trump Jr.  Jared Kushner  Carter Page  Michael Flynn  Roger Stone  Rick Gates  and George Papadopoulos and Betsy Devos’ brother  Erik Prince  the billionaire founder of Blackwater?
Will they finally admit that  Trump ’s poor character is the core problem  and that  as the Economist opined  “he does not have the character to change”? Republicans  on the other hand  have changed since  Trump  was elected. They’ve retreated from core positions on trade and security.
Republicans championed the benefits of free trade for decades. NAFTA was negotiated by Republican president George H.W. Bush and passed with mostly Republican votes. Republicans also supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement  which Marco Rubio wrote would “further our strategic goals in Asia and increase prosperity at home ” and Pat Toomey applauded TPP as a boon to economic growth and job creation. Yet  Trump ’s tirades against free trade—probably the biggest issue that won  him  the presidency—cowed many congressional Republicans into doing nothing as  Trump  abandoned the TPP.
They acquiesced as  Trump  weakened America’s ability to communicate  lead and influence on the world stage.  He  exited the Paris climate accord.  He  cut the State Department’s staff.  He  confused NATO members as to America’s commitment to defend its European allies. Now our allies in Southeast Asia worry that Trump  desperate for a win  will make a deal with China that emboldens it to bully its neighbors  further endangering our relationships in the region.
While the 2017 election results are heartening for Democrats  they should also be heartening in a different way for Republicans who have been stuck in  Trump ’s political chokehold. They should feel somewhat freer to speak honestly about their president and work to repair the damage he has caused. Pandering to  Trump  won’t get them reelected  and even if  it  did   it  still wouldn’t be worth the divisiveness  dysfunction and the loss of influence and respect America has suffered.

"input: âThe Honors are the greatest weekend of the year  and it is also the bane of our existence  â Deborah Rutter  said with a laugh. For the president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts  the annual Kennedy Center Honors  airing on CBS on Dec. 26 and honoring dancer Carmen de Lavallade  rapper LL Cool J  television producer and writer Norman Lear and singers Gloria Estefan and Lionel Richie  is a welcome national spotlight on the memorial to the late president. But thatâs all anyone seems to know about the the white jewel box on the Potomac.
âWe really like to think about the other 364 days of the year  and all of the programming that happens on those days â  Rutter  told me in the latest episode of âCape Up.â âWhat I love about being here at the nationâs cultural center is that we have really a mandate to welcome all of the performing arts. It is not just a performing arts center for one assumed art form or another.â
I bet you didnât know that hip hop was one of those art forms at the Kennedy Center and that Q-Tip is its artistic director. âThis is a first â  Rutter  said. âAnd as far as I know  there is no other artistic director for hip-hop â¦ anywhere in probably the world. And weâre very proud to have Q-Tip here leading  guiding and inspiring us.â
While she didnât need much convincing   Rutter  allowed that there could be others who might â for fear of what it could mean for the other arts. âJust because we are bringing in more programming that includes hip-hop artists  it does not mean that weâre doing less dance or less international programming or less of the National Symphony Orchestra â she said. âIt just means that weâre doing more  that we have thrown open the doors of the Kennedy Center  and we are ensuring that all are welcome here.â

There are nine performance spaces at the Kennedy Center that are in use all year. In addition to the orchestra and  the Washington National Opera  Rutter  noted the 46-year-old institution has âa magnificent  world-recognized ballet season.

Listen to the podcast to hear  Rutter  talk further about the work of the Kennedy Center and how it fits into the cultural life of Washington.  She  goes into what it is like to be the local performing arts center for members of Congress  foreign diplomats and âquite a number of justices from the Supreme Court.â But  Rutter  insists none of those constituencies tries to exert influence over programming.
âHere at the center we have no limits on what we could present â  Rutter  told me. âThe problems I always describe is how to say no  when to say no  and how to not be really  truly overwhelmed by the extraordinary limitless richness of what happens here.â

 GOP Rep. Trent Franks  resigns amid 'inappropriate behavior' claim
A few hours later  Politico reported that  Franks  had not just approached  his  female staffers about surrogacy — but also seemingly proposed sexual intercourse as a means to impregnate them.
The women said they decided to file complaints with the House Ethics Committee because they were concerned  Franks  was asking about sex  not artificial insemination.
GOP sources aware of the complaints said one of the women claimed she was retaliated against after rebuffing  Franks ' lewd proposal  having her previous access to the congressman revoked.
Also Friday  the Associated Press reported that  Franks  had offered one of the women a whopping $5 million to act as a surrogate for  him  and  his  wife. The woman claimed  Franks  pressed her repeatedly about surrogacy after she initially rebuffed  him .
In addition to talks of surrogacy   Franks  tried to convince a female aide that they were in love after sending her an article describing how two people know they love each other  according to the Politico report.
 Franks'  abrupt resignation comes as Washington  D.C.  reels from a sexual harassment scandal involving dozens of male politicians. Just hours before  Franks  initially announced  his  resignation  Democratic Sen. Al Franken stepped down in response to shocking claims that he sexually harassed a number of women. A few days before that  Franks’ Democratic House colleague John Conyers announced his resignation amid a sexual harassment scandal of his own.
 Franks  forcefully denied ever engaging in sexual misconduct in a lengthy statement on Thursday.
House Speaker Paul Ryan accepted Franks’ resignation on Friday. The House ethics investigation into the shocking claims against  Franks  has thereby been called off  the committee said.

Nevertheless  the former Democrat operative and Salon contributor  still publicly scolds Conway because  in his own opinion  Trump did not speak out strongly enough.
Additionally   Tapper  frequently presents  himself  as a male feminist  as a champion of women  and does so using  his  Twitter account and last-place CNN show as a platform to broadcast lectures that portray  him  as a hero in defense of women.

The Mustang that  Steve McQueen  drove into Hollywood history for the 1968 movie Bullitt emerged for the first time in 40 years Sunday at the Detroit auto show in tandem with the debut of a new  limited-edition 2019 Mustang Bullitt.

âThe car shows the gentle patina of time. It has rust marks â said Gessler  who noted that Detroit will be the first stop before a national tour that includes Washington   D.C. âSteve McQueen  wanted to create the most realistic chase scene ever on film.  He  found a director  Peter Yates  and Warner Bros. gave  him  the reins. They took four weeks to shoot an 11-minute chase scene.â
 McQueen  had all the badging on the car removed. It was recognizable from just its angles and silhouettes. And thatâs why the new model is so sparse  said Kevin Marti  owner of Marti Auto Works in El Mirage  Ariz.  who created and maintains the database for every Ford vehicle built since 1967. âThis car is so iconic that you donât even need to put a name on the thing. That speaks to the confidence Ford has.â
As the licensee of Ford production records   he  tracks every vehicle identification number for more than 140 million cars  and  he  notes style and color trends of each era. In the 1960s  popular cars were avocado green  white and red. In the 1970s  automakers turned to browns  yellows and earthy colors. Now consumers lean toward silver  white and black. So Dark Highland Green will make a statement. It is a throwback color on a throwback car.
âI love the different sounds that Bullitt makes  the roaring "" he said. ""And  Steve McQueen  is one of those movie stars that stays in your mind after all this time.â
The company called  Molly McQueen .
""I honestly didn't know how to drive a stick shift and I stalled it quite a few times. By the end of the second day of shooting  they asked me to slow down. It becomes second nature. And you're thinking about the gears and the clutch and driving becomes a fun activity as opposed to just a way to get from one place to  another "" McQueen  said in advance of Sunday's event at Cobo Center.
Few people know  Molly McQueen  is the famous actorâs granddaughter.  She  grew up in Pacific Palisades with a film producer mother who spent most of  her  time as at home as a mom. Now  Molly  is a writer  actress and producer who recently sold  her  first project to Warner Bros.  the company that made  her  grandfather famous.

"input: The court will hear arguments in  an appeal by federal prison inmate Timothy Carpenter .  He  is serving a 116-year sentence after a jury convicted  him  of armed robberies in the Detroit area and northwestern Ohio.
Investigators helped build their case by matching  Carpenter 's use of  his  smartphone to cell towers near Radio Shack and T-Mobile stores that had been robbed. The question is whether prosecutors should have been required to convince a judge that they had good reason  or probable cause  to believe  Carpenter  was involved in the crime. That's the standard set out in the Constitution's Fourth Amendment  which also prohibits unreasonable searches. Prosecutors obtained the records by meeting a lower standard of proof.
The American Civil Liberties Union  representing  Carpenter   said in court papers that the records ""make it possible to reconstruct in detail everywhere an individual has traveled over hours  days  weeks or months.""
In  Carpenter 's case  authorities obtained cellphone records for 127 days and could determine when he slept at home and where he attended church on Sunday  said the ACLU's Nathan Freed Wessler.

"input: A senator forcefully delivered the stick and chipping  Collins'  glass elephant
Washington (CNN) During bipartisan talks between senators to discuss passing a funding bill to end the government shutdown  Sen. Susan Collins whose office was being used for the negotiations  figured out a civil way to create discussion.
One Republican senator describing the incident told CNN the stick was successful  but on one occasion  one of the other senators was speaking while another asked a question and then turned with another quick  longer  louder question. The member who was holding the stick ""forcefully delivered"" the stick across the room -- but it missed its mark and caused damage to a shelf in  Collins ' office.
A glass elephant sitting on a shelf owned by  Collins  became the casualty  with the stick chipping it a little bit.

"input: A federal grand jury looking into  a soured $10 million real estate deal that involved the wife of Sen. Bernie Sanders  sought information on statements made to secure the loan  according to a witness and former trustee at the college where  Jane Sanders  served as president.
Robin Lloyd  who served on the board at Burlington College  confirmed that a grand jury was looking into the case as recently as October. She said the panel was interested in what  Sanders  may have told trustees and lenders in order to secure the 2010 loan  for a 33-acre campus along Lake Champlain.
""Theyâre trying to pull together where did the money come from to enable Burlington College to convince (Peopleâs United Bank) and the diocese to go ahead with  the deal .â - Robin Lloyd  former Burlington College trustee
âTheyâre trying to pull together where did the money come from to enable Burlington College to convince (Peopleâs United Bank) and the diocese to go ahead with  the deal  â Lloyd told the Burlington Free Press.
 Sanders  reportedly told college trustees and bank lenders that the college had millions of dollars in donations that could be used to repay the loan. The land was purchased from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington.
At the time   Sanders  sought a $6.5 million loan from Peopleâs United Bank to buy tax-exempt bonds issued by a state agency  and a $3.65 million second mortgage from the Roman Catholic Dioceses of Burlington.
In order to secure the money   Sanders  reportedly submitted a spreadsheet asserting that the school had $2.4 million in confirmed pledges  grants  and other funds to repay the debt.
A spokesperson for the Sanders family  Jeff Weaver  said they had âabsolutely no reason to believe that there is a grand jury empaneled to examine Burlington College  Dr. Jane Sanders  or any aspect of  Dr. Sanders â service as president of Burlington College.

"input: On Wednesday morning  NBC confirmed that they had fired morning news anchor  Matt Lauer .  Lauer  has served as the centerpiece of Today  which The New York Times calls âthe most important part of the NBC News franchise â since 1997. A memo from NBC News chairman Andy Lack cited âinappropriate sexual behaviorâ as the grounds for termination.
âOn Monday night â Lack wrote  âWe received a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace by  Matt Lauer . It represented  after serious review  a clear violation of our companyâs standards.â
While NBC took swift action against  Lauer  even before the allegations went public  itâs safe to assume that this story is far from over. As Lack himself acknowledged  âWhile it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over twenty years heâs been at NBC News  we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident.â
In the wake of  Lauer âs unexpected departure  Today was forced to reckon with the story in real time. Lauerâs co-host Savannah Guthrie was tasked with reporting on the latest in a string of sexual misconduct stories  this time involving her âdear  dear friendâ and colleague. âHow do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they have behaved badly?â an emotional Guthrie asked. âAll we can say is we are heartbroken; Iâm heartbroken.â
Like the other recently disgraced media men before him  Lauerâs career is now open for reexamination. One incident thatâs already been circulated and picked apart by social media is the Presidential Forum that  Lauer  moderated in September 2016. At the time   Lauer  was widely criticized for the way  he  interacted with candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton  with many accusing the Today host of employing a sexist double standard. In one article  âHow Sexism  Like Matt Lauerâs  Could Imperil the Nation â Adele M. Stan wrote  âWhen questioning Clinton   Lauer  was all alpha-male  interrupting  her  and tsk-tsking  her  for criticizing  her  opponent after he had asked  her  not to do so. But when paired with Trump  it became clear who was the alpha in that set-up. It clearly wasn't  Lauer   who allowed Trump to talk over him  and to evade specifics.â
While  Lauer âs tendency to interrupt Clinton repeatedlyâwhile letting Trump go largely unchallengedâwas certainly cringe-worthy  it may not be Lauerâs most painful on-air interaction. Anyone searching for an example of overt sexism need look no further than his 2012 Today interview with Anne Hathaway. The actress  who was promoting her film Les Miserables at the time  had had the misfortune of being photographed during a âwardrobe malfunction.â âI was getting out of the car and my dress was so tight that I didnât realize it until I saw all the photographersâ flashes â she reportedly said in response to the âdevastatingâ incident. As if the revealing photographs werenât enough  Hathaway was then grilled on the minor controversy by  Lauer   who opened the interview with a gross allusion to the intimate pics.
âAnne Hathaway  good morning  nice to see you. Seen a lot of you lately â  Lauer  greeted  his  guest. While Hathaway  who responded that  âIâd be happy to stay home â clearly had no interest in discussing the upskirt shots   Lauer  continued. âLetâs just get it out of the way. You had a little wardrobe malfunction the other night. Whatâs the lesson learned from something like that  other than that you keep smiling  which youâll always do.â To summarize:  Lauer   mistaking pervy paparazzi pics for actual news  asked an accomplished actress about a painful incident  phrasing the invasion of privacy as a personal failing (âwhatâs the lesson learned from something like that?â). To make matters even worse  he all but told Hathaway to smile through itâwhich is just what every woman wants to hear from a man whoâs talking down to her about her lack of underwear on national television.
Hathaway  to her credit  managed to own  Lauer   replying  âWell  it was obviously an unfortunate incident. It kind of made me sad on two accounts. One was that I was very sad that we live in an age when someone takes a picture of another person in a vulnerable moment  and rather than delete it and do the decent thing  sells it. And Iâm sorry that we live in a culture that commodifies sexuality of unwilling participants  which brings us back to Les Mis  because thatâs what the character [Fantine] is. She is someone who is forced to sell sex to benefit her child because she has nothing and thereâs no social safety net so yeahâletâs get back to Les Mis.â

"input: On Monday  a federal judge rescheduled proceedings for  Zakaryia Abdin  to January  according to documents filed in federal court. Both prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed to spend more time preparing  in part because some of the evidence is classified.
 Abdin  18   was arrested at Charleston's airport in March as  he  tried to board a plane for Jordan. Authorities said  he  told an undercover FBI agent posing as an Islamic State recruiter that  he  wanted to torture an American  and would attack a U.S. site if  he  couldn't get out of the country.
 Abdin  has pleaded not guilty and remains jailed on a charge of attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization. If convicted  he could face up to 20 years in prison. His attorney has declined to comment.
The teen has been monitored for years. At 16  authorities said   he  talked about robbing a gun store to get weapons to kill soldiers as revenge for American military action in the Middle East.  He  was arrested before the robbery  pleaded guilty  and a parole board agreed to  his  early release after about a year in jail.
 Abdin  knew that authorities were still watching  him  â but apparently didn't realize  his  ""recruiter"" was a federal agent.
""We are most likely to contact an undercover agent than a real brother ""  Abdin  told the undercover agent. ""That is why I carry guns in my house  in my car and even I used to secretly take to school. It is very humiliating to be captured.""
According to an FBI statement released after  Abdin 's indictment   he  told the agent that if  he  did get to torture an American hostage   he  wanted  his  face shown on video  saying  ""I want to be the one to send the message because they know who I am.""
 Abdin  also sent a video of  himself  pledging  his  allegiance to the Islamic State in Arabic and told them  he  could do whatever was needed  according to the sworn statement. The FBI said  he  also practiced shooting several different guns during the first three months of 2017.
The FBI said  Abdin  knew agents would learn of  his  purchase and travel plans  and so tried to hide  his  tracks by contacting authorities to tell them  he  bought guns for hunting and would be traveling to the Middle East on a vacation.  He  also asked authorities for a meeting  where  he  told them  he  no longer held the extreme beliefs that led to  his  first arrest.

"input: (CNN)  Nadia  was just 15 when ISIS fighters swarmed into  her  homeland.  She  says  she  was kidnapped  bought and sold by men who told  her  they owned  her   and repeatedly raped by them.
Three years on  the traumatized Yazidi is finally free of  her  captors  but remains trapped in a living nightmare  fearing the ISIS militants could still get to  her   or worse  kill members of  her  family.
The frail 18-year-old former slave doesn't even know if  her  mother  father and brother are still alive.
At a meeting in the Kurdistan region of Iraq   she  hides behind  her  cousin  one hand clenching  her  relative's shirt  the other holding tight to  her  own dress. Shell-shocked   she  cannot remember how many younger siblings  she  has  and struggles to recall their names.
 Nadia  was kidnapped by ISIS fighters who took over  her  Yazidi homeland when  she  was 15.
Nadia (not  her  real name) was among thousands of Yazidis captured by ISIS in August 2014 when the terror group launched an assault on Sinjar  then home to more than half a million members of this minority group.
 Nadia  and and  her  older sister Amira were separated from the rest of the family.  Their  mother was pregnant at the time  and  Nadia  doesn't know where she - or her baby - is now.
It was here   Nadia  says  that  she  witnessed an incident that still haunts  her : ISIS militants took a child away from his mother as  she  screamed for him.  Her  captors responded by hitting  her  on the head.  Nadia  still doesn't know what happened to the pair at the hands of the terrorists.
""They would tell us we sold you  we bought you ""  she  says. ""There were days we would wish we would die so no one says they sold us ... Beating and everything else is bearable  but not selling.""
An Iraqi Kurdish investigator who asked to be identified as Shaima has heard stories like Nadia's dozens of times as she interviews freed Yazidis. ""Some of them are eager to tell their story. Some of them are reluctant because they can't go into the details -- it's difficult for them "" she says.
From Mosul   Nadia  and  her  sister were taken to Syria  where  Nadia  spent a year being moved between Homs  Tabqa  ISIS' self-declared capital  Raqqa  and Deir Ezzor.
 Nadia  says  her  sister Amira killed herself after she was forced to ""marry"" an ISIS fighter.
 Nadia  says  she  was repeatedly raped at the hands of  her  kidnappers.  Her  sister killed herself in captivity.
After her suicide   Nadia  says she was determined to get away. She and some other Yazidi captives tied their headscarves together to form a rope they used to climb out of the house where they were being held captive.
Sold to a Syrian ISIS fighter   Nadia  says  she  became pregnant; to avoid having a child conceived by rape   she  threw  herself  from walls and took pills to terminate the pregnancy.
""I did not want it  what else could I do?""  she  asks.

"input: (CNN) Protesters greeted  white supremacist leader Richard Spencer  with loud boos and chants of ""Go home Spencer"" during  his  speech Thursday afternoon at the University of Florida in Gainesville.
The talk was Spencer's first planned speech on a college campus since  he  and others participated in the "" Unite the Right "" rally in Charlottesville  Virginia  in August.
 Spencer  took the stage at the Phillips Center at just after 2:45 p.m. Those in the venue  many of whom stood with their fists raised  loudly booed and chanted lines like ""Go home  Spencer "" and ""Nazis are not welcome here.""
""I'm not going home  I will stand here all day if I have to "" a combative  Spencer  told the crowd.
People react as  Richard Spencer  speaks at the Phillips Center on Thursday in Gainesville  Florida.
Still  the heckling continued through  his  time on stage  leading to several moments of frustration from  Spencer .
The event thrust the university into the ongoing debate about what constitutes protected speech and the extent of its limits.  Spencer  is the president of the National Policy Institute  a leader of the ""alt-right"" movement and a proponent of the white nationalist movement that advocates for a white ""awakening"" and a white ethno-state.
Protesters held up signs against  Richard Spencer  in Gainesville.
University of Florida President W. Kent Fuchs denounced  Spencer 's white supremacist platform as abhorrent in a letter to students  but said the school could not stop him from renting the Phillips Center for the event.
Crowds gather outside  Richard Spencer's  speech at the Phillips Center at the University of Florida.
The vast majority of people out protesting were opposed to  Spencer  and  his  views. Craig Carlisle  from Gainesville  held up a sign saying ""No Trump Nazis."" He said he had a message for  Spencer : ""Don't be racist.""
Jamie Bell was one of many people protesting  Richard Spencer 's speech in Gainesville.
A man wearing a shirt with swastikas on it was punched by an unidentified person near the site of  a planned speech by Richard Spencer .
 White nationalist Richard Spencer  faced a vocal outcry at  his speech on Thursday .
In an interview with CNN on Tuesday   Spencer  said  he  was flattered by the state of emergency declaration  which  he  said put  him  on par with ""hurricanes and invading armies and zombie apocalypses.""
Still   he  said  he  thought the declaration was overkill.

"input: Republicans on the House Science Committee are accusing  Linda Birnbaum   director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences  of lobbying. In letters sent to the Inspector General and acting secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services  Reps. Lamar Smith and Andy Biggs wrote that they were “conducting oversight” of  Birnbaum ’s activity in response to a editorial she wrote in a scientific journal.
 Birnbaum ’s editorial  which the journal PLOS Biology published in December  addressed the gaps in the regulation of toxic chemicals. Though there are more than 85 000 chemicals approved for use in commerce  she noted in the piece  “U.S. policy has not accounted for evidence that chemicals in widespread use can cause cancer and other chronic diseases  damage reproductive systems  and harm developing brains at low levels of exposure once believed to be harmless.”
A toxicologist who has headed NIEHS and the National Toxicology Program since 2009   Birnbaum  received no funding for writing the editorial  as  she  notes in the piece  nor does  she  recommend any specific policy  piece of legislation  or action in it beyond being engaged citizens.
Smith and Bigg’s attack on  Birnbaum  seems less designed to exonerate a particular chemical. In the editorial that caused the most recent stir in the House committee   Birnbaum  introduced an issue of the journal that covered a broad range of environmental science problems from the challenges of setting drinking water limits for PFOA to the need clarify the relationship between the dose and response of certain chemicals.
