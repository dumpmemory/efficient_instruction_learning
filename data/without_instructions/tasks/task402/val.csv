"input: original question: Which museum is of type [Applied arts]?
answer: gruuthusemuseum
answer type: Museum.
auxiliary information: The applied arts are the application of design and decoration to everyday objects to make them aesthetically pleasing. The term is applied in distinction to the fine arts which aims to produce objects which are beautiful and/or provide intellectual stimulation. In practice, the two often overlap. The fields of industrial design, graphic design, fashion design, interior design and the decorative arts are considered applied arts. In a creative and/or abstract context, the fields of architecture and photography are also considered applied arts.
output: ",[Applied arts] is a museum for what type?
"input: original question: Which armed force has military combatant [Romania]?
answer: romanian military police
answer type: Armed Force.
auxiliary information: Romania is a unitary semi-presidential republic located in Southeastern Europe, bordering the Black Sea, between Bulgaria and Ukraine. It also borders Hungary, Serbia, and Moldova. It covers 238,391 square kilometres and has a temperate-continental climate. With its 19.9 million inhabitants, it is the seventh most populous member state of the European Union. Its capital and largest city, Bucharest, is the sixth largest city in the EU. The River Danube, which is Europe's second longest river after the Volga, rises in Germany and flows southeastwards for a distance of 2,857 km course through ten countries before emptying in Romania's Danube Delta. Some of its 1,075 km length bordering the country drains the whole of it. The Carpathian Mountains cross Romania from the north to the southwest. Modern Romania emerged within the territories of the ancient Roman province of Dacia, and was formed in 1859 through a personal union of the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia. The new state, officially named Romania since 1866, gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877. At the end of World War I, Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia united with the sovereign Kingdom of Romania.

"input: original question: Find films whose format is [HDCAM].
answer: rec 3: g√©nesis, inside, magpie...
answer type: Film.
auxiliary information: HDCAM, introduced in 1997, is a high-definition video digital recording videocassette version of digital Betacam, using an 8-bit discrete cosine transform compressed 3:1:1 recording, in 1080i-compatible down-sampled resolution of 1440√ó1080, and adding 24p and 23.976 progressive segmented frame modes to later models. The HDCAM codec uses rectangular pixels and as such the recorded 1440√ó1080 content is upsampled to 1920√ó1080 on playback. The recorded video bit rate is 144 Mbit/s. Audio is also similar, with four channels of AES3 20-bit, 48 kHz digital audio. Like Betacam, HDCAM tapes are produced in small and large cassette sizes; the small cassette uses the same form factor as the original Betamax. The main competitor to HDCAM is the DVCPRO HD format offered by Panasonic. It uses a similar compression scheme and bit rates ranging from 40 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s depending on frame rate.
output: ",What are some examples of films that are made in the format [HDCAM]?
"input: original question: Who is in [Galla Placidia]?
answer: galla placidia
answer type: Person Or Being In Fiction.
auxiliary information: Galla Placidia is the fictional representation for Galla Placidia, daughter of the Roman Emperor Theodosius I, and the Regent for Emperor Valentinian III from 423 until his majority in 437.
output: ",Who does feature in [Galla Placidia]?
"input: original question: Which religious jurisdiction is of the size or type of [Ecclesiastical province]?
answer: roman catholic province of tuam, ecclesiastical province of canada, roman catholic province of armagh...
answer type: Religious Jurisdiction.
auxiliary information: An ecclesiastical province is a large jurisdiction of religious government, so named by analogy with the secular Roman province. In hierarchical Christian churches that have dioceses, a province is a collection of those dioceses. The Roman Catholic Church, the Orthodox Churches and the Anglican Communion all have provinces. These provinces are led by a metropolitan archbishop. In the early church and in some modern churches, an ecclesiastical province's principal episcopal see is called the metropolis and its bishop is called the metropolitan bishop or metropolitan.
output: ",What are some examples of religious jurisdictions that would be considered an example of an [Ecclesiastical province]?
"input: original question: Which conlang is created by [Herman Miller]?
answer: gargish
answer type: Conlang.
output: ",[Herman Miller] created a conlang by which name?
"input: original question: what is the unit of time in [Planck units]?
answer: planck time
answer type: Unit of Time.
auxiliary information: In physics, Planck units are physical units of measurement defined exclusively in terms of five universal physical constants listed below, in such a manner that these five physical constants take on the numerical value of 1 when expressed in terms of these units. Planck units have profound significance for theoretical physics since they elegantly simplify several recurring algebraic expressions of physical law by nondimensionalization. They are particularly relevant in research on unified theories such as quantum gravity.
output: ",what do you call the unit of time in [Planck units]
"input: original question: What is the parent method of [Time division multiple access]?
answer: multi-frequency time division multiple access, self-organized time division multiple access
answer type: Channel access method.
auxiliary information: Time division multiple access is a channel access method for shared medium networks. It allows several users to share the same frequency channel by dividing the signal into different time slots. The users transmit in rapid succession, one after the other, each using its own time slot. This allows multiple stations to share the same transmission medium while using only a part of its channel capacity. TDMA is used in the digital 2G cellular systems such as Global System for Mobile Communications, IS-136, Personal Digital Cellular and iDEN, and in the Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications standard for portable phones. It is also used extensively in satellite systems, combat-net radio systems, and PON networks for upstream traffic from premises to the operator. For usage of Dynamic TDMA packet mode communication, see below. TDMA is a type of time-division multiplexing, with the special point that instead of having one transmitter connected to one receiver, there are multiple transmitters.
output: ",What is the main mode of [Time division multiple access]?
