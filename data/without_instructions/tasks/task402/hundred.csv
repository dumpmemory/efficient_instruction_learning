answer type: Wine.
auxiliary information: Canada is a country, consisting of ten provinces and three territories, in the northern part of the continent of North America. It extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres in total, making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's common border with the United States forms the world's longest land border. The land now called Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the late 15th century, British and French colonies were established on the region's Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost North American territories until left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867, three colonies joined to form the autonomous federal Dominion of Canada. This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the new self-governing Dominion.

"input: original question: What is the facility access of [Royal Montreal Golf Club]
answer: private
answer type: Golf Facility Access.
auxiliary information: 'The Royal Montreal Golf Club' is the oldest golf club in North America, founded 142 years ago in 1873. On the 4th day of November 1873, in the youthful but growing port city of Montreal, a small group of eight gentlemen sat in a dockside office and formed the Montreal Golf Club. This was the first effort to place golf on an organized basis, not only in Canada but in North America and it is, therefore, the oldest golf club in continuous existence on the continent. Eleven years later, in 1884, permission was granted by Queen Victoria to use the ""Royal"" prefix. The first golf course was a 9-hole layout on Fletcher's Field, part of Mount Royal Park, which was shared by the red-coated golfers and other citizens relaxing in what was then the outskirts of Montreal. The first female member, Mrs. William Wallis Watson, was elected in 1891 - the first woman of any golf club in North America. With her election, began the Ladies' Branch of the Royal Montreal Golf Club. In 1899, the Ladies moved into their own clubhouse at Dixie. In 1896, the club had moved to Dixie, in the parish of Dorval, where it remained until the pressures of urban growth again dictated a decision to move.

"input: original question: Which softwares use the protocol of [User Datagram Protocol]?
answer: apple remote desktop, twisted
answer type: Software.
auxiliary information: The User Datagram Protocol is one of the core members of the Internet protocol suite. The protocol was designed by David P. Reed in 1980 and formally defined in RFC 768. UDP uses a simple connectionless transmission model with a minimum of protocol mechanism. It has no handshaking dialogues, and thus exposes any unreliability of the underlying network protocol to the user's program. There is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection. UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and port numbers for addressing different functions at the source and destination of the datagram. With UDP, computer applications can send messages, in this case referred to as datagrams, to other hosts on an Internet Protocol network without prior communications to set up special transmission channels or data paths. UDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction is either not necessary or is performed in the application, avoiding the overhead of such processing at the network interface level. Time-sensitive applications often use UDP because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for delayed packets, which may not be an option in a real-time system.

The field of neutrino astronomy is still very much in its infancy ‚Äì the only confirmed extraterrestrial sources so far are the Sun and supernova SN1987A. Neutrino observatories will ""give astronomers fresh eyes with which to study the universe."" Various detection methods have been used. Super Kamiokande is a large volume of water surrounded by phototubes that watch for the Cherenkov radiation emitted when an incoming neutrino creates an electron or muon in the water. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory is similar, but uses heavy water as the detecting medium. Other detectors have consisted of large volumes of chlorine or gallium which are periodically checked for excesses of argon or germanium, respectively, which are created by neutrinos interacting with the original substance.

"input: original question: Which product ingredient is a variety of [Sugar substitute]?
answer: glycerol
answer type: Product ingredient.
auxiliary information: A sugar substitute is a food additive that provides a sweet taste like that of sugar while containing significantly less food energy. Some sugar substitutes are natural and some are synthetic. Those that are not natural are, in general, called artificial sweeteners. An important class of sugar substitutes is known as high-intensity sweeteners. These are compounds with many times the sweetness of sucrose, common table sugar. As a result, much less sweetener is required and energy contribution is often negligible. The sensation of sweetness caused by these compounds is sometimes notably different from sucrose, so they are often used in complex mixtures that achieve the most natural sweet sensation. If the sucrose that is replaced has contributed to the texture of the product, then a bulking agent is often also needed. This may be seen in soft drinks or sweet tea that are labeled as ""diet"" or ""light"" that contain artificial sweeteners and often have notably different mouthfeel, or in table sugar replacements that mix maltodextrins with an intense sweetener to achieve satisfactory texture sensation.

answer type: Unit of frequency.
auxiliary information: The International System of Units is the modern form of the metric system and is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both commerce and science. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. It defines twenty-two named units, and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram.

auxiliary information: Hindu can refer to either a religious or cultural identity associated with the philosophical, religious and cultural systems that are indigenous to the Indian subcontinent. In common use today, it refers to an adherent of Hinduism. However, in the Constitution of India, the word ""Hindu"" has been used in places to denote persons professing any religion originated in India. Further, the terms Hindu or Hindi are also used as a cultural identity to denote people living on the other side of the Indus river, thus poets like Iqbal, ministers like M.C.Chagla and organisations like the RSS used the terms Hindu and Hindi to represent any person living south and east of the Indus river, irrespective of religion. The word Hindu is derived from the Sanskrit word Sindhu, the historic local name for the Indus River in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. According to Gavin Flood, ""The actual term Hindu first occurs as a Persian geographical term for the people who lived beyond the river Indus"". The term Hindu then was a geographical term and did not refer to a religion.

"input: original question: Which unit of capacitance is in the measurement system of [International System of Units]?
answer: farad
answer type: Unit of Capacitance.
auxiliary information: The International System of Units is the modern form of the metric system and is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both commerce and science. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. It defines twenty-two named units, and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram.

"input: original question: Which measurement system use [Kilogram] as mass unit?
answer: international system of units
answer type: Measurement System.
auxiliary information: The kilogram or kilogramme, is the base unit of mass in the International System of Units and is defined as being equal to the mass of the International Prototype of the Kilogram. The gram, 1/1000th of a kilogram, was originally defined in 1795 as the mass of one cubic centimeter of water at the melting point of water. The original prototype kilogram, manufactured in 1799 and from which the IPK is derived, had a mass equal to the mass of 1.000025 liters of water at 4 ¬∞C. The kilogram is the only SI base unit with an SI prefix as part of its name. It is also the only SI unit that is still directly defined by an artifact rather than a fundamental physical property that can be reproduced in different laboratories. Three other base units in the SI system are defined relative to the kilogram, so its stability is important. The International Prototype Kilogram was commissioned by the General Conference on Weights and Measures under the authority of the Metre Convention, and is in the custody of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures who hold it on behalf of the CGPM.
