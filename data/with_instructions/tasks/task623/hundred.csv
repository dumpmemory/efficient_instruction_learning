input: Abstract: Some patients converted from ventricular fibrillation to organized rhythms by defibrillation-trained ambulance technicians (EMT-Ds) will refibrillate before hospital arrival. The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.

input: Abstract: Our results suggest that ethylene oxide retention after sterilization is increased in cuprammonium cellulose plate dialyzers containing potting compound. In contrast, cuprammonium cellulose plate dialyzers without potting compound were characterized by a rapid disappearance of retained ethylene oxide after sterilization. Whether these findings explain the low incidence of SARD with cuprammonium cellulose plate dialyzers that do not contain potting material is a matter for continued study and experimentation.

input: Abstract: Based on our preliminary studies and the results of this study, we conclude that argon laser welding of 4-8 mm internal diameter veins, arteries, and arteriovenous fistulas may have several potential advantages compared to conventional suture techniques. The benefits of laser repairs may include improved mechanical properties, and absence of the foreign body response related to sutures. Laser welding is sterile, nontactile and possibly time conserving, and the wounds heal rapidly without aneurysms or excess tissue proliferation.

Now complete the following example-
input: Abstract: The System 7 pump/actuator/engine combination has demonstrated biologic compatibility and physiologic effectiveness and responsiveness in five TVAS in vivo studies. The recent 75-day implant supports the feasibility of extended reliability of the system components. Postoperative system maintenance was necessary only because of the nonhermetic design of System 7. However, the ability to pump 11 l/min at 120 beats/min, synchronize at beat rates of 144 beats/min, and pump against mean arterial pressures of more than 150 mmHg while maintaining hematologic and biochemical values within physiologic range sets a very optimistic stage for System 8 hardware. A System 8 concept is shown in Figure 14. The System 8 hardware will include a thermal salt package capable of providing completely untethered circulatory support for a nominal 8-h period. Recharge will be accomplished with a transcutaneous transformer in 1 h. Thermal management problems become minimal, with an average energy input of 15.8 W (peak of 24.9 W). The human preclinical testing of System 8 will start in 1988.

This device requires 12 to 15 W to pump 6 to 8 l/min with minimal hemolysis. The motor drive has functioned for periods up to 93 days in vivo with no measurable wear. The compliance chamber volume varies by 100 cc during VAD function but does so while maintaining pressure variations below 15 mmHg. Compliance chamber volume loss of 2 to 5 cc/day is explained by gas transport through SPU. The subcutaneous sampling port provides ready access to the sealed system.

This finding contrasts with the results of currently available prostheses, including autologous vein, which rapidly become minimally compliant. We conclude that this vascular construction is stable over the long-term following implantation and may improve the success of small internal diameter arterial reconstruction by eliminating failures caused by intimal hyperplasia.

The membrane was shown by in vitro and clinical tests to affect the activation of the complement system very little, and it retains the high dialysis efficiency, good tolerance to steam autoclave sterilization, and economical production cost characteristics of the original cellulose membrane. It thus appears that the new cellulose provides the optimum combination of qualities needed in a hemodialysis membrane.

There were no significant differences in volume of distribution (area) (139 v. 152 ml kg-1), clearance (5.1 v. 5.3 ml kg-1 min-1), T1/2 alpha (2.1 v. 2.0 min), or T1/2 beta (19.1 v. 20.3 min) between children with normal hepatic and renal function and those with moderately impaired hepatic function presenting for hepatic transplantation. There were significant differences in volume of distribution (area) (176 v. 139 ml kg-1) and in clearance of atracurium (9.1 v. 5.1 ml kg-1 min-1) between infants and children with normal excretory function. In infants the clearance of atracurium in ml m-2 min-1 (153 v. 133) tended to be greater and the T1/2 alpha and T1/2 beta tended to be shorter (1.0 v. 2.0 and 13.6 v. 19.1) than in children with normal excretory function; however, these trends did not reach statistical significance. Plasma laudanosine concentration was around 100 ng ml-1 greater in patients with liver disease than in normal children from 15-45 min following a bolus of atracurium 0.5 mg kg-1.

Blood samples were obtained before, and at 2 and 5 min after the administration of the neuromuscular blocker. The twitch response to 0.15 Hz was also evaluated. None of the 10 patients receiving vecuronium had a significant increase in plasma histamine concentration. In two of the 10 children receiving atracurium, the plasma histamine concentration increased markedly, but without any apparent clinical manifestations. Recovery of neuromuscular function (to 95% twitch height) after vecuronium 0.12 mg kg-1 was faster than after atracurium 0.6 mg kg-1 (P less than 0.02).

input: Abstract: The effects of atracurium and alcuronium on the evoked mechanical and electromyographic responses of the adductor pollicis were investigated in 30 adult patients. The ulnar nerve was stimulated with trains of four supramaximal pulses of 0.2 ms duration and a frequency of 2 Hz at intervals of 20 s. The mechanical response was measured using a strain gauge force transducer and the evoked compound action potential (ECAP) was recorded simultaneously using a Medelec MS91 electromyography system. Depression of the electromyographic and mechanical responses, caused by atracurium, was similar during onset and antagonism of blockade. During onset of blockade by alcuronium, the mechanical response was depressed to a significantly greater extent compared with the ECAP. This difference was not observed during antagonism with neostigmine. The rates of onset of atracurium and alcuronium were generally similar, but the rate of onset of mechanical fade was greater in the alcuronium group. There was no significant quantitative difference between the rates of antagonism of alcuronium and atracurium when assessed by the mechanical first response ratio. Electromyographic first response and electromyographic and mechanical train-of-four ratios recovered more rapidly in the atracurium group. These findings suggest that the differences between mechanical and electromyographic measurements of neuromuscular blockade are drug-specific and are more pronounced during the onset of blockade than during its antagonism by neostigmine.

input: Abstract: The effectiveness of neostigmine 0.07 mg kg-1 and edrophonium 0.8 mg kg-1 as antagonists of profound neuromuscular blockade induced by vecuronium 0.1 mg kg-1 or atracurium 0.5 mg kg-1 was studied in 59 healthy patients. The antagonists were administered 5 min after total ablation of the twitch response and the end-point of recovery was a train-of-four ratio of 70%. In 30 patients given vecuronium the mean time to reach this point (duration TOF70) was 66.7 min in the control group (no antagonist), 43.5 min in the group given neostigmine and 59.8 min in the group given edrophonium. The duration TOF70 was shorter in the neostigmine group than in the control (P less than 0.01) and edrophonium (P less than 0.01) groups. The duration TOF70 did not differ from control in the edrophonium group. In 29 patients given atracurium, the durations TOF70 were 66.4, 44.1 and 54.9 min in the control, neostigmine and edrophonium groups, respectively. The durations TOF70 in the neostigmine (P less than 0.01) and edrophonium (P less than 0.01), groups were shorter than control. The duration TOF70 of the neostigmine group was shorter than in the edrophonium group (P less than 0.01). These results show that profound neuromuscular blockade cannot be rapidly antagonized by either of these two agents, but if reversal is required under these circumstances, neostigmine would be the more effective drug.

input: Abstract: Antagonism of atracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade by neostigmine or edrophonium has been studied using the tetanic (50 Hz) and train-of-four (2 Hz) or single twitch responses of the adductor pollicis muscle in 22 anaesthetized patients. A further nine patients not given an anticholinesterase acted as a control group. In two groups (six patients for each anticholinesterase) in whom antagonism was attempted at 95-98% blockade of the tetanic response, recovery of the tetanic response after two or three doses of edrophonium 0.75 mg kg-1 i.v. was not statistically different from that in the control group; recovery after two doses of neostigmine 2.5 mg i.v. was significantly faster (P less than 0.001). Recovery of the single twitch response after antagonism with edrophonium, although longer than that with neostigmine (P less than 0.01), was significantly shorter than in the control group (P less than 0.05). When edrophonium is given at the commencement of recovery, the initial rapid antagonism of tetanic block is not sustained, whereas antagonism by neostigmine is more persistent and the recovery phase is significantly shortened. In a further two groups of patients (n = 5) given atracurium 0.3 mg kg-1 i.v., antagonism was not attempted until the peak height of the tetanic contraction had reached approximately 50% of the control value.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

input: Abstract: The pharmacokinetics of the long-acting anticholinesterase drug, galanthamine, were investigated in eight patients. After i.v. injection of 0.3 mg kg-1, the decrease in the serum concentration of galanthamine followed a biexponential curve. The serum concentration decreased rapidly from 543 +/- 47 ng ml-1 to 128 +/- 14 ng ml-1 between 2 and 30 min with a T1/2 alpha of 6.42 +/- 2.15 min, and then declined more slowly with a T1/2 beta of 264 +/- 28 min. Total serum clearance of galanthamine amounted to 5.37 +/- 0.87 ml min-1 kg-1, and the renal clearance was 1.36 +/- 0.10 ml min-1 kg-1. The cumulative urinary excretion of galanthamine between 0 and 48 h after injection amounted to 28.0 +/- 5.4% of the administered dose. The biliary excretion of galanthamine during 24 h amounted to 0.2 +/- 0.1% of the dose. There was no evidence of glucuronide or sulphate conjugation of galanthamine.

input: Abstract: Blood flow through and chlormethiazole extraction ratios across lungs, liver, kidneys and gut were measured in awake unrestrained sheep (controls) and with the same animals anaesthetized with 1.5% halothane or whilst undergoing high thoracic subarachnoid blockade with amethocaine. In the control-drug studies, chlormethiazole infused to sub-sedative blood concentrations produced no significant changes in haemodynamics or in the kinetics of iodohippurate (renal and hepatic blood flows). Chlormethiazole was eliminated predominantly by the liver (mean extraction ratio and clearance, respectively, 0.90 and 1.3 litre min-1) and lungs (0.15; 0.6 litre min-1). Renal clearance was absent or negligible (greater than 0.1 litre min-1). Because of pulmonary clearance, mean total body clearance was derived from analysis of pulmonary arterial concentrations. Under general anaesthesia, there were significant reductions in mean cardiac output, hepatic and renal blood flow (to 54%, 63% and 43% of control); chlormethiazole mean hepatic extraction ratios and clearance were reduced, respectively, to 82% and 56% of control, and its pulmonary and renal clearances were abolished. With subarachnoid anaesthesia there were no significant changes in haemodynamics or in chlormethiazole extraction ratios or clearances.

input: Abstract: Twelve (34%) of thirty-five patients with an active infection on the palms or soles caused by Hendersonula toruloidea or Scytalidium hyalinum were found to have circulating antibodies to these organisms by counter immunoelectrophoresis or immunodiffusion, compared with 9% of uninfected controls. In every instance there was cross-reactivity between the positive patients' sera and the heterologous non-dermatophyte antigen. Using crossed and intermediate gel immunoelectrophoresis it was found that cytoplasmic extracts of H. toruloidea and S. hyalinum showed 34 and 41 precipitin peaks respectively, most of which were shared by both organisms. No cross-reactions were observed between the non-dermatophyte cytoplasmic extracts and hyperimmune animal antisera raised to Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton interdigitale, Aspergillus fumigatus or Candida albicans. Exoantigens prepared from the two non-dermatophytes showed similar cross-reactivity between the two species. It appears that H. toruloidea and S. hyalinum are very similar in antigenic structure, a finding which lends support to the view that they may be closely related. They are also antigenically distinct from other pathogenic fungi which commonly infect skin, a fact which may be useful in their cultural identification as well as their recognition in tissue specimens.

input: Abstract: The effect of indomethacin gel on UVB and UVC erythema was assessed objectively using a reflectance instrument. When indomethacin was applied immediately after irradiation, UVR (ultraviolet radiation) dose-dependent suppression of erythema was demonstrated for both wavelengths until 36 h after irradiation when both indomethacin and control gel base-treated sites were equally erythematous. Suppression of erythema also occurred when application of indomethacin was delayed until 24 h after irradiation, showing that for both wavelengths prostaglandin synthesis remains increased throughout this period. The degree of suppression at any time, however, was no greater than that achieved by a single application immediately after irradiation, indicating that the eventual equal erythema of indomethacin and gel base-treated sites was not due to tachyphylaxis or inadequate dosage. Construction of dose-response curves for the indomethacin-responsive and indomethacin-unresponsive components of erythema shows that in human skin the difference in erythemal response to UVB and UVC radiation is not due to the formation of different mediators at these wavelengths.

input: Abstract: Some patients converted from ventricular fibrillation to organized rhythms by defibrillation-trained ambulance technicians (EMT-Ds) will refibrillate before hospital arrival. The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.

input: Abstract: We succeeded in reproducing an eczematous lesion on the apparently normal skin of a patient with atopic dermatitis by scratching and continuous application of an ointment containing ferritin-labelled mite antigen. Percutaneous entry of mite antigen was demonstrated in skin biopsies by Fe-staining. Scratched skin first showed an urticarial reaction typical of type I allergy which later changed into an eczematous reaction typical of type IV allergy. This change was also shown histologically.

The study included 30 healthy non-pregnant women and 90 healthy pregnant women equally distributed across the three trimesters. Two variables were investigated: the number of mononuclear cells in phagocytosis and the average number of bacteria per monocyte in phagocytosis. As pregnancy progressed a gradual and significant increase was found in the number of monocytes in phagocytosis and a significantly higher proportion of macrophages with six or more bacteria per phagocyte.

input: Abstract: Random-dot stereograms were found to be capable of producing fusional vergence amplitudes in the absence of monocular contours. These vergence amplitudes are not an artefact of monocular contours provided by the target borders or test instrument and are comparable in range to vergence amplitudes measured clinically with second degree fusion targets in an amblyoscope. We conclude that diplopia of monocularly recognisable contours is not necessary for producing fusional vergence amplitudes.

input: Abstract: Labrador keratopathy (LK) is an acquired corneal degeneration thought to be caused by chronic exposure to solar irradiation. Reports so far suggest that it is a progressive or at least a stationary condition. There are no detailed reports on recommended therapy. A prospective clinical study was conducted to show regression of LK following extracapsular cataract extraction. Seventeen black patients (26 eyes) with LK and mature cataracts underwent extracapsular cataract extraction. The severity of the LK was recorded photographically pre- and postoperatively. The follow-up ranged from 6 to fifteen months. Twenty-four eyes (92%) showed regression of the LK. The reduction in exposure to ultraviolet light as a result of aphakic photophobia could be one of the factors which have led to the regression of the LK.

These observations suggest that cotton-wool spots may be an early finding in diabetic retinopathy. Significant biological abnormalities in these patients were high levels of glycosylated haemoglobin and mild increases in thrombin generation, indicating slight activation of the coagulation system. The possible significance of these clinical and biological findings is discussed.

input: Abstract: The murine IgG2a monoclonal antibody 6-19 binds to a wide variety of nonhematopoietic cells including human marrow-derived stromal cells but does not bind to marrow or peripheral blood cells. We studied the effects of this antibody and rabbit complement on marrow cells. Fibroblast colonies were eliminated from light density marrow cells by a single incubation with monoclonal antibody 6-19 and complement. The growth and composition of granulocytic and erythroid colonies were unaffected. Specific complement mediated cytotoxicity of the antibody was confirmed on passaged human fibroblasts derived from marrow (more than 99.6% of fibroblasts are killed by a single treatment). Similar results were obtained with human umbilical cord endothelial cells. In addition, such treatment abolished the initiation of Dexter culture stroma. Incubation of bone marrow cell suspensions with this antibody and complement will allow the study of stroma-free marrow cells in long-term liquid cultures.

Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.

input: Abstract: Sl/Sld mice have a defective hemopoietic microenvironment. It has been assumed, based upon previous studies, that the primary abnormality in these mice is simply lack of a necessary supportive or inductive material within the hemopoietic stroma. We used in vitro long-term bone marrow cultures to characterize further the nature of the hemopoietic microenvironmental defect in Sl/Sld mice. Sl/Sld mouse bone marrow cells consistently produced less than 10% of the total hemopoietic cells and multipotent and unipotent hemopoietic progenitor cells produced in cultures of marrow from normal, congenic +/+ mice. If fresh Sl/Sld and +/+ marrow cells were mixed prior to establishing long-term marrow cultures, there was a direct correlation between number of Sl/Sld cells added and degree of inhibition of +/+ hemopoiesis. A pre-established, confluent Sl/Sld adherent stromal layer inhibited hemopoiesis by fresh +/+ marrow cells by nearly 70%, as compared with dishes with irradiated +/+ or no stroma. This inhibitory effect was abrogated by irradiation of the Sl/Sld stroma prior to addition of the fresh +/+ marrow cells. Similarly, unirradiated, but not 9 to 200 Gy irradiated Sl/Sld stroma inhibited proliferation of the factor-dependent FDC-P1 hemopoietic progenitor cell line. Thus, the Sl/Sld hemopoietic microenvironment actively inhibits hemopoiesis in vitro, and this inhibition can be at least partially eliminated by irradiation of the Sl/Sld stroma.

Now complete the following example-
input: Abstract: Epinephrine causes platelet aggregation and secretion by interacting with alpha 2-adrenergic receptors on the platelet surface. Platelet aggregation requires the binding of fibrinogen to a specific receptor on the membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex. Although the IIb-IIIa complex is identifiable on the surface of resting platelets, the fibrinogen receptor is expressed only after platelet activation. The current studies were designed to examine the effect of occupancy of platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors by epinephrine on the expression of fibrinogen receptors and on the aggregation of platelets. The ability of epinephrine to induce the expression of fibrinogen receptors was studied under two different conditions: acute stimulation (less than 1 min) and prolonged stimulation (50 to 90 min), the latter of which is associated with a reduction or ""desensitization"" of the platelet aggregation response. Expression of the fibrinogen receptor was monitored with 125I-fibrinogen as well as with 125I-PAC-1 (PAC-1), a monoclonal antibody that binds to the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex only after platelets are activated. Epinephrine caused an immediate increase in PAC-1 and fibrinogen binding that was dependent on occupancy of the alpha 2-receptor by epinephrine and on the presence of extracellular free Ca (KCa = 30 mumol/L). By itself, 1 mmol/L Mg was unable to support induction of the fibrinogen receptor by epinephrine. However, it did decrease the Ca requirement by about two orders of magnitude. Prolonged stimulation of unstirred platelets by epinephrine led to a 70% decrease in the aggregation response when the platelets were subsequently stirred. Despite their decreased aggregation response, desensitized platelets bound PAC-1 and fibrinogen normally, indicating that the loss of aggregation was not due simply to a decrease in fibrinogen receptor expression. Although desensitization was not affected by pretreatment of the platelets with aspirin, it was partially prevented when extracellular Ca was chelated by EDTA during the long incubation with epinephrine. These studies demonstrate that once platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are occupied by epinephrine, extracellular Ca is involved in initiating the aggregation response by supporting the induction of the fibrinogen receptor and the binding of fibrinogen. Furthermore. Ca-dependent reactions subsequent to fibrinogen binding may be necessary for maximal platelet aggregation and are impaired when platelets become desensitized to epinephrine.

input: Abstract: Lymphocytes from 18 patients with the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Most peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal individuals are covered with slender microvillus projections, but a large proportion of lymphocytes from WAS patients were found to be relatively devoid of microvilli. A lymphocyte morphology scoring system was developed to quantify the density of microvilli: Grade 4 classified those lymphocytes with greater than 75% of the surface covered with microvilli with progressive decrements to grade 1, which were those without microvilli. The mean lymphocyte morphology score of eight normal individuals was 3.62 +/- .22. The mean lymphocyte score of WAS patients was substantially lower (2.89 +/- .27, P less than .001). In addition, WAS lymphocytes often were qualitatively abnormal, with short, blunted microvilli. These morphological criteria were used to diagnose WAS from the cord blood lymphocytes of one ""at-risk"" patient. Thus, WAS is the first primary immunodeficiency in which morphological abnormalities have been identified that can aid in diagnosis.

input: Abstract: The ultimate cause of destruction of red blood cells (RBCs) after oxidative damage with Heinz body formation is not well understood. We correlated the changes in RBC morphology and membrane protein composition after oxidant treatment with the alterations in deformability of whole cells and cell membranes. The incubation of RBCs with phenylhydrazine concentrations of 0.3 to 100 mg/dL at 37 degrees C for one hour led to a dose-dependent formation of Heinz bodies, ranging from isolated Heinz bodies at 1 mg/dL to a confluent coating of the inner membrane surface at 100 mg/dL phenylhydrazine. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of a large quantity of hemoglobin bound to the ghost membrane of treated RBCs. Electrophoresis with and without dithiothreitol indicated that disulfide bridges are abundant between hemoglobin molecules and are also present among membrane proteins but are not the major bond between hemoglobin and membrane. Changes of spectrin, ankyrin, band 3, and band 6 and the appearance of a 260,000-dalton complex were also observed. With phenylhydrazine concentrations below 30 mg/dL, even in the presence of multiple Heinz bodies, the RBC deformability measured by filtration through 2.6-, 4.5-, and 6.8-microns pores and the membrane deformability determined by a filter aspiration technique were not altered. With 100 mg/dL phenylhydrazine, when the entire membrane was coated with Heinz bodies, RBC filterability and membrane deformability were drastically reduced. These results indicate that oxidative damage of RBCs with discrete Heinz body formation causes focal membrane rigidification but does not affect the global cellular deformability until the Heinz bodies nearly cover the entire cell endoface.

input: Abstract: We have studied the hematology, hemoglobin composition, and globin gene arrangements in one young Turkish boy with a beta zero-thalassemia homozygosity and in 11 of his relatives. Evidence is presented that the chromosome with the beta zero-thalassemia determinant carries a gamma-globin gene quadruplication, perhaps in a -G gamma-G gamma-G gamma-A gamma-gene arrangement. The eight gamma-globin genes in this patient produced G gamma and A gamma chains in a 95 to 5 ratio, and nearly 99% of the patient's hemoglobin was of the fetal type. The clinical condition resembled that of a thalassemia intermedia. HbF levels in eight beta-thalassemia heterozygotes varied between 0.5 and 4.2% and the percentages of G gamma in this HbF averaged at 87% or 95%; this level is to some extent related to the haplotype of the normal chromosome. All subjects carried four alpha-globin genes; a new BglII polymorphism was observed within the psi alpha-globin gene.

Neuraminidase-inaccessible, ie residual cell-associated sialic acid after neuraminidase treatment, was four- to twelvefold lower in the three differentiation-inducer-resistant sublines than in the parent line. Neuraminidase treatment of 125I-labeled surface membrane glycoproteins (SMGs) from wt HL-60 cells converted the two-dimensional gel electrophoretic pattern to one having features in common with RA- and 6TG-resistant cells. However, neuraminidase treatment did not alter the sensitivity of wt HL-60 cells to differentiation induction by RA, hypoxanthine (purine base), or DMSO. These results indicate that differences in peripheral, neuraminidase-accessible sialic acids are important determinants of the gel electrophoretic mobility of the SMGs of the HL-60 line and sublines but are not likely related to the differentiation-resistance mechanism. Further studies are required to determine if hyposialylation of cryptic, neuraminidase-inaccessible sites has functional significance.

input: Abstract: We examined the activity of defensins, cysteine-rich cationic peptides that are abundant in the cytoplasmic granules of human and rabbit granulocytes, against various tumor targets. The three human defensins, HNP-1, HNP-2, and HNP-3, lysed human and murine targets in chromium release and dye exclusion assays. Defensin-mediated tumor cell lysis was concentration-dependent, inhibited by serum, and dependent on temperature-sensitive events. Lysis was first detected by three hours of incubation and it reached a plateau between eight and 14 hours. In vitro exposure of murine teratocarcinoma cells to HNP 1-3 abrogated their oncogenicity in vivo. Nonmalignant target cells were also susceptible to defensin-mediated lysis. Four rabbit granulocyte defensins exerted marked (NP-1, NP-2) or moderate (NP-3a, NP-3b) cytotoxic activity, whereas defensin NP-5 was not cytotoxic. When tumor cells were incubated with human defensins in combination with hydrogen peroxide, synergistic cytotoxicity was detected. As defensins are released from granulocytes by various stimuli, their release could contribute to extracellular cytotoxicity which is independent of reactive oxygen intermediates.

The direct effect on stimulated SA production of pre-incubating cells with prednisolone in vitro was also studied. Significant inhibition of monocyte SA output stimulated with IgG-treated zymosan (ITZ) and fluoride ion (F), but not serum-treated zymosan (STZ) was demonstrated following steroid therapy in RA. No inhibitory effect of prednisolone could be demonstrated in vitro, using ITZ, STZ and F as stimuli. Our data on blood monocyte yields, size and cytochemistry suggest that the in vivo effect is due to a shift in blood monocyte traffic.

input: Abstract: Methotrexate (MTX) appears to be useful in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) refractory to other drugs but its long-term toxicity and efficacy are uncertain. A retrospective study of MTX in such patients in comparison with the purine analogues, azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine was made using life-table analysis. Eighty-four patients took MTX in a median dose of 7.5 mg/week whilst 55 received purine analogues, 100 mg/day (median). By 12 months, 19.3% of patients had ceased MTX due to toxicity, compared with 29.3% for purine analogues. Toxicity severe enough to warrant stopping therapy was uncommon after 8 months with either drug. At 12 months 61.5% of the MTX patients had achieved defined criteria of improvement compared with 25.6% for the purine analogues (p less than 0.05). The number of patients improving on purine analogues did not increase substantially after 6 months, whereas the number improving with MTX continued to 12 months. MTX in a low-dose regimen is useful in refractory RA and superior to low-dose purine analogues.

input: Abstract: Some patients converted from ventricular fibrillation to organized rhythms by defibrillation-trained ambulance technicians (EMT-Ds) will refibrillate before hospital arrival. The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.

input: Abstract: Cells with mutations at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) locus may be detected in vitro by their resistance to the toxic effects of thioguanine. We have assessed HPRT mutants in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with connective tissue diseases who have been treated for long periods with cytotoxic drugs. The results from patients treated with cyclophosphamide were abnormal suggesting the presence of drug-induced mutations. The results from patients treated with chlorambucil or azathioprine did not differ from controls--either these drugs have not induced mutations or, more likely, the technique is not sufficiently sensitive to detect them. These possibilities are discussed. Specific mutations induced by cytotoxic drugs in patients with connective tissue diseases have not been previously recorded.

We were unable to show any abnormality in the excretion of Zn, Mg or GAG. In 11 patients, a low level of urinary citrate was a significant feature that was associated in most cases with a urinary pH value above 6. Citrate concentration (per litre) and output (per 24 h) were found to be lower than in the controls in 19 and 33% respectively of the determinations. The overall ratio of average urinary citrate concentration in patients and controls was 0.56, a figure in agreement with previous data.

input: Abstract: Five cases of clinically manifest solitary and bilateral renal lesions metastatic from the lung are presented. These cases are unusual in that renal metastases are usually silent lesions discovered at autopsy. Review of the autopsy data from this hospital identified renal metastases in 19% of patients who died from carcinoma of the lung. This incidence parallels that of other series. A solid renal lesion which is identified in a patient with a history of pulmonary carcinoma should raise the suspicion of renal metastases, especially if computed tomography of the mass demonstrates relative homogeneity and minimal enhancement. More frequent use of the abdominal CT scan in staging patients with lung cancer will render metastatic carcinoma from lung to kidney a more frequent ante mortem diagnosis.

Now complete the following example-
input: Abstract: The influence of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) on human detrusor and on pig detrusor, trigone, bladder neck and urethral smooth muscle was explored in a series of in vitro experiments. Serotonin evoked a dose-dependent and reversible contraction of the detrusor. The reverse response was triggered in trigone, bladder neck and urethral smooth muscle--a dose-dependent and reversible relaxation. The maximum amplitude of this relaxation was 85 +/- 15% of the relaxation produced by electrical nerve stimulation. The effect of serotonin was unaltered by blockade of ganglia, alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, cholinergic receptors and prostaglandin synthesis. The serotonin antagonists ketanserin, methysergide and cyproheptadine partly inhibited the effect of serotonin. The antagonism differed in potency on strips of different origin. The antagonists were ineffective or minimally effective in blocking responses to nerve stimulation. The effect of serotonin was probably mediated by specific serotonin receptors different from the serotonin-S2-receptors predominating in vascular smooth muscle. Serotonin is a potential neurotransmitter in lower urinary tract smooth muscle, but its importance in micturition physiology and pathophysiology is unknown.

The pattern of contraction during voiding allowed prediction of the outcome of treatment. Patients with urethral sphincter incompetence and a sustained detrusor contraction had a good result from colposuspension even if detrusor instability was found during filling. Where the urethral sphincter was competent, patients with urge incontinence with or without detrusor instability during filling cystometry had a good response to drugs, providing a sustained detrusor contraction was present during voiding. Urethral sphincter incompetence was characterised by a low detrusor voiding pressure.

input: Abstract: Twenty-five patients with fracture of the penis were treated surgically between 1968 and 1984. Long-term follow-up was obtained in 17. In no case were there any early post-operative complications. All patients stated that they were achieving normal, painless erections; two patients developed a slight penile curvature but this did not affect their sexual activities. We strongly recommend early surgical intervention because of these encouraging results. Urethral injury associated with the fracture did not occur in this series.

input: Abstract: Some patients converted from ventricular fibrillation to organized rhythms by defibrillation-trained ambulance technicians (EMT-Ds) will refibrillate before hospital arrival. The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.

Now complete the following example-
input: Abstract: Skilled forelimb use was studied in rats with unilateral lesions of the sensorimotor cortex, the caudate-putamen, or the dopaminergic nigrostriatal bundle, in a task involving reaching for food. Limb preference and efficiency were evaluated, as well as the relationship between limb use, spontaneous, and methamphetamine-induced rotation bias, both preoperatively and postoperatively. To induce use of the nonpreferred limb, a bracelet, which prevented reaching but not other movements, was attached to the forearm of the preferred forelimb. Whereas small cortical lesions of the forepaw area of the sensorimotor cortex mildly influenced limb preference and use, larger lesions changed preference. Furthermore, medium-sized sensorimotor cortex lesions impaired contralateral limb use, although surprising recovery occurred on the forced tests with the bracelet. Large cortical lesions abolished effective reaching even on the forced tests. Impairments similar to those following sensorimotor cortex lesions were also obtained following small and large caudate-putamen lesions. By contrast, unilateral dopamine depletions not only blocked use of the limb contralateral to the depletion but also impaired use of the ipsilateral limb. There was recovery in use of the ipsilateral forelimb but not the contralateral forelimb. Correlational analysis showed a weak relation between methamphetamine-induced rotation and limb preference preoperatively but no significant relation between these two variables postoperatively. The similarity in the deficits following sensorimotor cortex lesions and basal ganglia lesions suggests that skilled forelimb use depends upon a shared neural organization within the two systems.

input: Abstract: The study was designed to investigate the changes in axonal transport that result from disturbances in protein synthesis. Doxorubicin, an antineoplastic drug which interferes with the function of DNA, has a selective effect on peripheral sensory nerves because of the high vascular permeability in the dorsal root ganglia. After the intravenous administration of a moderate dose (4 mg/kg) to male Wistar rats, the transport of slow component a (SCa) was found to be retarded, transport velocity being decreased by 17% (0.85 +/- 0.06 mm/day vs 1.03 +/- 0.06 mm/day in controls). The transport kinetics of the fast anterograde and retrograde components (aFC and rFC) were unchanged after the administration of a dose of 6 mg/kg, although the relative amount of aFC was decreased by 27% (3.2 +/- 0.9% vs 4.4 +/- 1.1% in controls). It is suggested that the neuronopathy induced by doxorubicin is mediated by changes in axonal transport.

input: Abstract: The clinical features of 66 patients with histologically defined mitochondrial myopathy are described. The age of onset of symptoms ranged from birth to 68 years, but was before 20 years in 61%. Nineteen patients had similarly affected relatives. Three groups of cases could be identified clinically: a combination of progressive external ophthalmoplegia and weakness of the limbs induced or increased by exertion (55%); such limb weakness alone (18%); and those with clinical features, such as ataxia, dementia, deafness, involuntary movements and seizures, predominantly or exclusively arising from the CNS (27%). There was considerable overlap between these groups, and pigmentary retinopathy, present in 36% of patients, occurred in all three. At a mean disease duration of twenty years, 9 patients (all from Group 3) were severely disabled but 42 were still able to work. In vitro studies of mitochondrial metabolism, performed in 33 cases, most commonly showed deficiencies of the mitochondrial respiratory chain localized to complex I (18 patients) or complex III (9). No typical clinical picture emerged for any of the identifiable biochemical defects.

This observation does not invalidate the concept of functional groupings within these anterior horn cell pools. In studies of the same segment in cords obtained at autopsy from patients with motor neuron disease, zones of focal loss of motor neurons were identified, without consistent severity or distribution at different sectional levels. These findings imply varying resistance to the disease in different pools of motor neurons.

input: Abstract: Previous serial measurements of lymphocyte subpopulations in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) have demonstrated periodic reductions in the number of OKT8 positive (T8+) cells. In this longitudinal study, involving twice monthly samples from each participant and carried out in two phases lasting at least six and three months respectively, we have confirmed that fluctuations in T8+ cells occur in patients with MS and also found a significant reduction in this lymphocyte subpopulation in patients' spouses but not their siblings, compared with unrelated controls. The changes observed in spouses were related in time to those occurring in patients on 10/13 occasions from 5/9 families; no temporal relationship occurred in the remainder. Taking two or more low T8+ values as significant, 12/13 patients, 7/9 spouses, 6/13 siblings and 4/13 controls (chi 2 = 12.5; P less than 0.01) were abnormal at some stage. Our results provide indirect evidence for the role of environmental factors in determining certain immunological abnormalities present in patients with MS and illustrate the role of family studies in determining the specificity of these changes to the disease.

The present experiment was designed to test two fundamental aspects of spatial ability, namely right-left discrimination and the manipulation of those concepts in different spatial perspectives. Measures of accuracy and reaction time were taken. The performance of patients with Parkinson's disease did not differ from that of normal subjects in the spatial components of the task. Neither a review of the literature, nor the results of the present study, give support to the idea of a generalized visuospatial deficit in Parkinson's disease.

Now complete the following example-
input: Abstract: A rabbit inhalation injury model using a dual tracer radioactive isotope technique (Rowland et al., 1986), has been utilized with small- and medium-sized molecular weight tracers. There is oedema formation at 2 h after smoke inhalation or fluid resuscitation and especially with the combination of inhalation injury and fluid resuscitation [corrected]. This oedema appears to have decreased by 24 h post-injury. There does not appear to be any difference between the small- and medium-sized tracers in the transit times of tracer in the lung vascular compartment. The increases in extravascular water volume have been confirmed by gravimetric analyses of the lungs. Thus the pulmonary oedema in the rabbit animal model is detectable within 2 h post-injury, with a return towards normal values some time within 24 h if fluid challenged for short periods. Fluid resuscitation exacerbates the amount of oedema that developed. The onset of pulmonary oedema may therefore be earlier than previously seen clinically, and fluid resuscitation modifications may be of benefit in smoke inhalation injury.

A sham group acted as control. In comparison with the sham group, the specific activity of succinic dehydrogenase was slightly decreased and the activities of cytochromes b and c + c were decreased significantly 30 min after burning. All the results suggest a lack of increased metabolic activity during the early phase of burn injury.

input: Abstract: Some patients converted from ventricular fibrillation to organized rhythms by defibrillation-trained ambulance technicians (EMT-Ds) will refibrillate before hospital arrival. The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.

input: Abstract: A retrospective epidemiological study of industrial burns admitted to the Royal Brisbane Hospital was conducted over a period of 7 years. A total of 182 patients were included in this survey--173 males (95 per cent) and 9 females (5 per cent). The proportion of industrial burns has decreased from 31.5 per cent to 18.5 per cent of total admissions to the burns unit over the past 10 years. Fifty per cent of the burns occurred in males less than 30 years old. The average age was 31 years. Two-thirds of the burns covered less than 10 per cent of the body and 84 per cent covered less than 20 per cent. While scalds were the commonest cause of industrial burns in our study (19.4 per cent), flame burns with clothing ignited caused the most extensive burns. Face and hands were the most common sites involved. Burns to these regions were mainly caused by flame and electrical burns. Eye burns comprised 5.5 per cent of the sample and were due to chemicals, gas explosions and electric flash. Twenty-six patients (14 per cent) suffered respiratory injury. Only one patient out of our series of 182 died. Progress has been made in industrial safety in the past few years but carelessness and human error still take their toll.

input: Abstract: During the 17 years preceding March 1985, 140 patients sustained lightning injuries caused by 44 thunderbolts. Fifty patients showed evidence of current flow through their bodies. These 50 victims were classified into two groups, the first consisting of 9 victims who showed rupture of their clothes or linear superficial dermal burns along their whole bodies from head to feet, indicating the occurrence of surface flashovers. The remaining 41 patients showed no evidence of this flash effect. It is noteworthy that in the first group 5 of the 9 survived, whereas in the second group only 6 among 41 survived. The result indicates that when a flashover occurs along the whole body, the probability of survival is higher than 50 per cent. The conditions which determine death or survival were investigated experimentally, imposing artificial lightning voltage impulses on rats and developing flashovers on them. The rats survived when the voltage drop caused by flashover occurred immediately after the peak point, and the current waveform exhibited a sharp peak. In contrast, the rats were killed when the voltage drop caused by flashover was delayed by more than 20 microseconds, and the current waveform showed a blunt cone shape. It has been concluded that a fast flashover appreciably diminishes the energy dissipation within the body and consequently results in survival.

All the games are for individual players, on different intellectual levels, and provide different active ranges of motion: for fingers, wrist, elbow and shoulder. Most of the games were made by a former patient, now retired, copied from games in the collection of the occupational therapist, and some of the games are of Israeli idea and manufacture. All the games can be gas autoclaved and therefore be used from patient to patient. The games also provide a much needed outlet for intellectual stimuli and distraction from the burns unit and all it signifies.

input: Abstract: The electromagnetic spectrum consists of radiant energy that is classified according to specific wavelengths. Man is constantly exposed to a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, particularly to radiation in the ultraviolet, visible and infrared regions. The tissues of the eye and skin are particularly sensitive to the non-ionizing wavelengths of radiant energy. Although both tissues possess endogenous protective mechanisms to minimize the effects of such exposure, problems still occur due to the absorption of radiation. The cornea, lens and retina have been shown to be susceptible to damage from light in the ultraviolet, visible and infrared range. Part I of this two-part article examines the structures of the eye that are most susceptible to light damage; part II, which will be published in the next issue of the Journal, focuses on eye protection.

These symptoms, which had been intermittent at first, continued practically uninterrupted during the last 2 years. She was diagnosed as having superior oblique myokymia of the right eye. Adequate trials of oral carbamazepine, baclofen and phenytoin were unsuccessful in suppressing her symptoms. One year after her initial presentation, she underwent a right superior oblique tenectomy and a right inferior oblique recession. She eventually required a second operation on her other eye to cure her of an annoying diplopia on down-gaze.

Although 25 patients claimed that they wished to die at the time of admission, all of the 14 surviving patients wished to live at the time of discharge from hospital. Of the 12 patients who died, 6 stated that they no longer wished to die in the last interview before their death. During the following year 3 of the 14 surviving patients killed themselves. The findings emphasize the importance of thoroughly assessing all aspects of the suicidal patient's situation in determining risks. The patient's stated intentions should be but one factor considered.

input: Abstract: Some patients converted from ventricular fibrillation to organized rhythms by defibrillation-trained ambulance technicians (EMT-Ds) will refibrillate before hospital arrival. The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.

input: Abstract: Off-road vehicles have attained growing popularity, expanding markets and increasing rates of associated injury, especially among young people. In 1984-85, 148 patients were treated at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, for injuries suffered in off-road vehicle accidents. The average age of the patients was 14 years. Soft-tissue injuries occurred in 33 patients, 21 of whom had severe injuries. There were 179 fractures in 133 patients. One patient died as a result of his injuries. The most common mechanism of injury was losing control of and tumbling from the machine. Seventeen patients were struck by their own vehicles, and 39 collided with objects such as cars, trees or people. The health care costs of these accidents are no less serious than the concerns for the appropriate legislation to protect consumers, particularly the young.

input: Abstract: The prognostic value of marrow chromosome findings was examined in 242 patients with preleukemic myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), with emphasis on the significance of single versus multiple karyotypic changes. In both groups, the results showed that patients with multiple chromosome abnormalities in a marrow clone had a very high probability of early death, from progression to leukemia or from other complications of hematopoietic dysfunction. Conversely, in patients with a hemic clone having only one karyotypic alteration (involving a single chromosome or single translocation), survival over 2 years was only slightly reduced as compared to those without chromosome abnormality. The only single karyotypic alteration perhaps associated with a markedly shortened survival was monosomy 7. These findings suggest that the conclusions of previous studies concerning the grave consequences of chromosome alterations in preleukemia largely reflect the clinical significance of clones with multiple cytogenetic changes. Prior knowledge of the karyotypic status of preleukemic patients should be helpful in evaluating current attempts to find effective treatment for these difficult disorders.

input: Abstract: Ninety-six patients with disseminated malignant melanoma received thrice weekly intramuscular injections of leukocyte A recombinant interferon (rIFN-alpha A, Roferon-A, Hoffmann La Roche) at doses of 12 X 10(6) U/m2 or 50 X 10(6) U/m2 with or without cimetidine as an immunorestorative agent. Four patients, two with prior chemotherapy, demonstrated either a complete response (3 months, soft tissue metastasis) or exceptionally durable response durations (months) of 29+ (soft tissue; lung lesion), 31+ (soft tissue), and 35+ (soft tissue; liver lesions). None of these patients had particularly characteristic clinical parameters. As noted previously, using chemotherapy, a small proportion of patients with advanced malignant melanoma, despite prior therapy, may achieve prolonged objective regression with rIFN-alpha A.

input: Abstract: Methylglyoxal bis (guanylhydrazone) (MGBG) is an inhibitor of polyamine synthesis. In vitro studies demonstrate the accumulation of some tumor cells in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Nineteen patients with advanced head and neck cancer were entered in a Phase II trial of MGBG. MGBG, 500 mg/M2, was administered as a brief intravenous infusion weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks. Dose modifications were based on cumulative toxicity after 2 weekly treatments. All but three patients had prior exposure to chemotherapy for disease recurrence. Of 17 patients evaluable for response and toxicity, one brief partial response was observed. The most common toxicities were mild to moderate nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomatitis. Myelosuppression occurred in three patients. Dose modifications were required in four patients; a maximum dose of 700 mg/M2 was tolerated. The results of four other Phase II single and combination chemotherapy trials of MGBG in head and neck cancer are reviewed. The single agent response rate in 59 patients was 22% (range, 6%-41%). The poor response rate observed in this trial was similar to that in other trials in which a heavily pretreated group of patients was evaluated. It is concluded that single agent MGBG is not a useful drug in heavily pretreated recurrent disease patients. However, because of its biochemical effects, further testing in combination with cycle specific agents and in larger numbers of patients with minimal prior treatment may be warranted.

input: Abstract: Two patients with metastatic dysgerminoma of the ovary were treated with a combination of etoposide, bleomycin, and cisplatin at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute at Houston. Both patients achieved a complete remission. Patient 1 developed a massive recurrence in the para-aortic lymph nodes 21 months after diagnosis and treatment with right salpingo-oophorectomy alone. She received four cycles of chemotherapy and is free of disease 21 months from the start of chemotherapy. Patient 2 had Stage III dysgerminoma and a lymphangiogram positive for tumor in the para-aortic lymph nodes. After surgery she received three cycles of chemotherapy and is free of disease 20 months from the start of chemotherapy. Both complete remissions were documented with second-look laparotomy. Chemotherapy may be an alternative to radiotherapy for the treatment of metastatic dysgerminoma and should also be considered for selected patients with Stage I disease. A literature review further supports the conclusion that additional clinical trials might expand the indications for chemotherapy in patients with this disease.

input: Abstract: Ten patients with advanced stage (TNM IIB-IVB) mycosis fungoides were treated with a combination chemotherapy program consisting of bleomycin and methotrexate weekly, doxorubicin every 3 weeks, and topical nitrogen mustard daily (BAM-M). Seven patients obtained histologically documented complete remissions ranging from 4 to 105+ months in duration. Median survival is 16.5+ months. Three patients in whom splenomegaly was detected during their staging evaluation underwent splenectomy. These three patients have had unmaintained disease-free survivals of 36+, 100+, and 105+ months. This study indicates that BAM-M is effective therapy for advanced stage mycosis fungoides and suggests that the therapeutic role of splenectomy should be evaluated further.

input: Abstract: Cell-mediated and humoral immune responses were assessed in 50 patients with oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) and the results were compared with those of 50 patients with oral-leukoplakia, 50 oral cancer patients, and 50 normal healthy adult controls. The number of high-affinity rosette-forming cells (HARFC) was found to be significantly decreased in OSMF and oral cancer, whereas the number of total rosette-forming cells (TRFC) remained unaltered. Levels of serum IgA, IgD, and IgE were found to be elevated both in OSMF and oral cancer. Immunologic derangements were found to be more pronounced in oral cancer than in OSMF. The enumeration of HARFC along with the estimation of serum levels of IgA, IgD, and IgE indicates that OSMF can be an intermediary stage in the malignant transformation of a normal cell, and that these parameters may serve as markers for the early detection of oral cancer.

input: Abstract: Head and neck cancer has rarely been reported to be a cause of meningeal carcinomatosis. These tumors are known more for their local invasiveness rather than distant metastasis. This would appear to preclude meningeal involvement, but close proximity to multiple cranial nerves may provide an access to the meninges. Six cases of head and neck cancer with meningeal invasion are presented. All six cases had malignant cells in their cerebrospinal fluid. Three cases had malignant cells recovered from a ventricular specimen after lumbar punctures were negative. The most common clinical finding on presentation was cranial nerve involvement. The optic nerve was involved most often with nerves VI and V the next most frequent. Headache was present in four patients and seizures occurred in two. No patient had meningismus. Our current treatment plan involves insertion of an Ommaya Reservoir and intraventricular methotrexate. Only patients whose primary head and neck tumor shows a response to systemic therapy undergo Ommaya placement. Meningeal carcinomatosis in head and neck cancer may be more prevalent than previously thought and the likely mechanism is via direct extension rather than hematogenous spread.

Data analysis indicated significant (p less than 0.01) increases in the mean (+/- SD) TSA and TSA/TP values in the cancer patients (78.1 +/- 19.2 mg/dl and 12.4 +/- 3.8 mg/g, respectively) and in the pathologic controls (76.0 +/- 7.5 mg/dl and 11.6 +/- 2.5 mg/g) when compared to the normal controls (67.3 +/- 7.1 mg/dl and 9.0 +/- 1.1 mg/g), and a significant decrease in the mean TP values in the cancer patients (6.4 +/- 1.1 g/dl) and pathologic controls (6.6 +/- 1.1 g/dl) when compared to normal controls (7.5 +/- 0.5 g/dl). No significant difference was observed between groups in LASA values. Further analysis of the data in patient subgroups based on the tissue involved, specific disease, or severity of the malignancy indicated that the lack of specificity of the markers was due primarily to restricted subgroups and that the sensitivity of TSA and TSA/TP increased as the malignancy became more severe. The results show that TSA/TP was the most useful of the markers tested for detecting malignancies. This marker should prove useful for monitoring malignant disease recurrence and/or progression and for evaluating the effectiveness of various therapeutic approaches.

The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.

input: Abstract: Chondrosarcoma of the temporal bone is a rare lesion. Clinically it has been confused with multiple sclerosis, glomus jugulare tumors, meningioma, and chordomas. The cranial nerve palsies frequently observed with the tumors are related to the anatomic locations of the tumors. Thirteen patients with this entity are presented and the eleven other cases in the literature are reviewed. Histologically the tumors are low grade and exhibit myxoid features. The myxoid features must be differentiated from chordoma and chondroid chordoma. The tumor locations preclude surgical excision and conventional radiation therapy can cause unacceptable neurologic sequelae. Proton beam therapy has been effective in short-term results and appears capable of avoiding serious neurologic side effects.

input: Abstract: Three clinicopathologic cases with a remarkable pattern of extensive diffuse subependymal periventricular spread of cerebral metastases from solid systemic cancer are reported. Two patients had a small cell carcinoma of the lung. In the third case, the histologic features of the brain metastases were consistent with a neuron-specific enolase-positive, small cell anaplastic carcinoma. Involvement of the choroid plexus and leptomeninges was moderate or absent. Intraparenchymatous nodular metastases were not found except in one case in which rare nodular superficial cortical metastases were present. The clinical data were nonspecific except for orthostatic hypotension, in one patient, which was probably due to the infiltration of the floor of the third and fourth ventricles. Results of the cerebrospinal fluid examination, available in two cases, were normal. The only diagnostic investigation was contrast-enhanced computed tomography scanning.

A review of previously reported cases of male breast cancer occurring in families and the association with other cancers in other family members is included. In previous reports on breast cancer in males, familial or hereditary factors have not generally been recognized as a major contributing factor. Of ten families reported (including our own) where there is sufficient information given, six families (60%) had females with breast cancer. It appears there are some families in which males as well as females have an increased risk of developing breast cancer.

input: Abstract: Many patients with diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma have dyspnea or chest pain. Cardiac symptomatology is frequently difficult to differentiate from symptoms of pleuropulmonary disease. To better define the clinical characteristics of cardiac involvement in patients with mesothelioma, the electrocardiographic (EKG) and echocardiographic findings in 64 patients with biopsy-proven malignant pleural mesothelioma were reviewed. A total of 19/64 (30%) patients had autopsy studies available for review. The EKG was abnormal in 55 patients (89%). Over half (60%) had an arrhythmia, including sinus tachycardia (42%), premature atrial and ventricular contractions (13%), atrial fibrillation (3%), and atrial flutter (1%). Over one third (37%) had a conduction abnormality, including bundle branch block (13%), hemiblock (8.5%), and incomplete right bundle branch block (13%). Echocardiography revealed a total of 13 patients with pericardial effusions, two with pericardial thickening, and one with an anterior sonolucent space. Of 19 autopsies, cardiac invasion was found in 14 (74%), with more than half to the pericardium and more than one quarter to the myocardium. It is concluded that: clinical cardiac abnormalities occur in the great majority of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, pathologic cardiac invasion occurs in the great majority of patients with pleural mesothelioma, and the EKG and echocardiogram are helpful in differentiating cardiac involvement from progressive pulmonary disease in patients with pleural mesothelioma.

input: Abstract: Simultaneous urinary flow cytometry, cytologic, and cystoscopic examinations were performed at 3-month intervals for a minimum of 1 year on 29 patients receiving intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) treatment of superficial bladder carcinoma. Flow cytometry (FCM) and cytology were concordant in 57 of 103 examinations; both FCM and cytology were positive in 38 instances, and carcinoma was confirmed by biopsy in 35 (92.1%). In 16 instances FCM and cytology were negative, but carcinoma was present on biopsy in 5 (31.3%). Three examinations were suspicious by both techniques. The 46 determinations with discordant FCM and cytology were subdivided into pathologically confirmed recurrences (25 instances) and no evidence of pathologic and/or cystoscopic disease (21 instances). In the 25 instances of recurrences, FCM was positive in 18 (72.0%), suspicious in 3 (12.0%), and negative in 4 (16.0%), while cytology was positive in 3 (12.0%), suspicious in 9 (36.0%), and negative in 13 (52.0%). Most patients had a severe BCG-induced inflammatory response that caused an elevation of the hyperdiploid population, believed secondary to epithelial regeneration and proliferation. In the 21 instances without detectable recurrence, hyperploidy led to a relatively high proportion of positive (15) and suspicious (4) results by FCM, but only eight had distinct aneuploid populations. It is possible that this latter group, at least, is harboring occult carcinoma. Conventional cytology in the nonrecurrent group was positive in 1 (4.8%), suspicious in 7 (33.3%), and negative in 13 (61.9%). In those instances when tumor was confirmed by biopsy, the false-negative rate for FCM was 19.7%; the false-negative rate for cytology was 40.9%. Thus, FCM appears to be more sensitive but less specific than conventional cytology, having a lower false-negative but a higher false-positive rate. Although serial FCM provides an objective quantitative measure of aneuploid stemlines and hyperdiploid populations in bladder irrigation specimens and can be helpful in following intravesical BCG therapy for superficial bladder carcinoma, it should still be used with conventional cytology. The greatest difficulty with FCM at present, as with conventional cytology, is in cases of marked inflammation. The results reported here were obtained under the most stringent conditions and represent the minimum level of accuracy. Potential improvements in the technique, with the addition of immunologic or other markers, hold hope of further increasing the accuracy of FCM.

input: Abstract: The effects of preoperative irradiation on the morphology of transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) were evaluated by studying the pretreatment biopsy and radical cystectomy specimens from 35 patients. Twenty-six of these patients had received 2000 rad within the week preceding surgery, and nine patients had received no preoperative treatment. The frequency of bladders without residual TCC was 23% for irradiated and 22% for nonirradiated cases. Of the TCCs classified as papillary in the biopsy specimens and irradiated, 79% lacked a papillary component at cystectomy, but in no case was the invasive component eliminated or regression from muscle invasion to superficial TCC noticed. Flat carcinoma in situ (CIS) did not respond to irradiation. At cystectomy nuclear pleomorphism was greater than at biopsy in 60% of the irradiated TCCs, whereas all nonirradiated cases retained the same grade as at biopsy. In addition, irradiation induced squamous differentiation in neoplastic cells only, without affecting the nonneoplastic urothelium.

input: Abstract: The importance of the once-obscure right ventricle is becoming evident. Even in disorders that primarily affect the left ventricle, the once-considered-passive conduit has proved essential for maintenance of normal cardiac output. In coronary artery disease, the function of the right ventricle is affected by both its circulation and the after-load placed on it by dysfunction of the left ventricle. In congestive heart failure, right ventricular function relates to functional capacity, whereas left ventricular function does not, and right ventricular ejection fraction is a useful prognostic guide in these patients. In mitral and aortic valvular disease, the role of the right ventricle is only now becoming evident, and the precise interplay of all factors has yet to be explained. In systemic hypertension, it is likely that the pulmonary circulation is affected by the same humoral factors that elevate systemic pressures.

Now complete the following example-
input: Abstract: A considerable amount of literature has been devoted to compromise of the right ventricle in spontaneous myocardial infarction. Little information is available regarding disproportionate dysfunction of the right ventricle associated with cardiac operation and the recovery period therefrom. Recognition of the problem is of paramount importance, if support measures are to be implemented. A great deal has yet to be learned regarding the appropriate support for the acutely failing right ventricle. Much remains to be accomplished regarding the assessment of right ventricle reserve, defining the role of risk factors, and quantitating the value of measures to optimally protect the right ventricle from injury during the perioperative period. Recognizing that the integrity of the right ventricle can be altered by numerous preoperative, perioperative and postoperative factors will provide an enlightened disposition on the part of the surgical team. Awareness of these considerations in the planning and conduct of surgical procedures should reduce morbidity and mortality from perioperative right ventricular failure. The imposition of new or unexpected morbidity during operation on a relatively unrelated problem represents surgical imperfection. Appropriate effort toward minimizing insult of the right ventricle could result in significantly decreasing the incidence and severity of perioperative right ventricular failure before the impetus of the continuing clinical problem dictates improvement in techniques to more appropriately treat this frequently preventable problem.

Now complete the following example-
input: Abstract: When right ventricular failure prohibits separation from cardiopulmonary bypass, standard methods of increasing pulmonary blood flow should be employed, including correction of hypoxia and acidosis, volume loading, and inotropic support of the right ventricle. Infusion of pulmonary vasodilators--particularly low-dose nitroprusside--should be used if the pulmonary vascular resistance is elevated. If pulmonary blood flow remains unsatisfactory, systemic intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation should be employed. In refractory cases, right-atrial-to-pulmonary-artery bypass using the Bio-Medicus centrifugal pump is the recommended therapy for those centers that do not have the Pierce-Donachy pneumatic ventricular assist-pump available. For refractory right ventricular failure following the surgical repair of congenital cardiac defects in which the placement of right atrial and pulmonary artery cannulae is not technically feasible, use of high-frequency high-volume ventilation appears to be quite promising. Utilization of pulmonary artery counterpulsation or the creation of an atrial septal defect may also be lifesaving, but is not recommended as the therapy of choice.

input: Abstract: Some patients converted from ventricular fibrillation to organized rhythms by defibrillation-trained ambulance technicians (EMT-Ds) will refibrillate before hospital arrival. The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.

input: Abstract: We used Doppler echocardiography to quantitate the changes in intracardiac blood flow velocities and right and left ventricular stroke volumes in 80 normal human fetuses from 19 to 40 weeks gestation. Blood flow velocity spectra across the aortic, pulmonary, tricuspid, and mitral valves were digitized to obtain peak velocities (m/sec) and flow velocity integrals. Aortic and pulmonary diameters were measured at valve level from two-dimensional echocardiographic images and cross-sectional area was calculated assuming a circular orifice. Ventricular stroke volume was calculated as the product of the cross-sectional area of a great vessel and the flow velocity integral through that vessel. The pulmonary arterial and aortic diameters increased linearly with gestational age (r = .82, r = .84), and pulmonary arterial diameter consistently exceeded aortic diameter. There was a positive relationship between stroke volume and gestational age: stroke volume increased exponentially from 0.7 ml at 20 weeks to 7.6 ml at 40 weeks for the right ventricle (r = .87) and from 0.7 ml at 20 weeks to 5.2 ml at 40 weeks for the left ventricle (r = .91). Similar results were obtained for right and left ventricular and combined cardiac outputs. In 44% of the fetuses it was possible to quantitate both right and left ventricular stroke volumes. There was a close correlation between right and left ventricular stroke volumes in these fetuses (r = .96) and right ventricular stroke volume exceeded left ventricular stroke volume by 28%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Now complete the following example-
input: Abstract: Atrial pacing was performed in 16 patients with angina at rest and significant coronary artery stenosis (greater than 70%) over 2 consecutive days in the morning (10 A.M. to 1 P.M.), in the afternoon (4 to 7 P.M.), and at night (12 midnight to 3 A.M.) to assess possible circadian variations of their ischemic threshold. Overall, the incidence of resting angina was highest at night. All pacing results were positive (greater than or equal to 1.0 mm ST segment shift) and tended to be reproducible in nine patients, whereas some or all were negative in seven. Among all positive results, ischemic thresholds at night were significantly lower than those in the morning and in the afternoon (125 +/- 3 vs 138 +/- 3 and 139 +/- 2 beats/min, mean +/- SEM; p less than .005). In nine patients, 19 pacing tests produced ST segment elevation, of which 13 were performed at night (68%). We conclude that patients with resting angina and severe coronary stenosis often exhibit a nocturnal decline in their ischemic threshold, which seems to facilitate development of transmural ischemia during atrial pacing.

Now complete the following example-
input: Abstract: It has been shown in different groups of patients with variant angina that coronary spasm can be reproduced by physiologic maneuvers and pharmacologic agents. It is not known, however, to what extent different stimuli can induce spasm in the same patient. To investigate whether coronary arterial spasm results from specific abnormal agonist-receptor interactions or from a local nonspecific coronary supersensitivity to different stimuli, 28 patients with vasospastic angina were submitted to a series of diverse vasoconstrictive stimuli known to provoke coronary spasm. Ergonovine, hyperventilation, handgrip, cold pressor, and exercise-tests, were carried out in all 28 patients. In the last 15 patients histamine was also administered. Spasm was provoked by ergonovine in 96% of patients, by hyperventilation in 54%, by histamine in 47%, by exercise in 46%, and by the cold pressor and handgrip tests in 11% and 7%, respectively. No significant differences were found in the responses to provocative tests of patients with normal coronary arteries or nonsignificant stenoses and those with significant lesions. In the same individual, spasm was induced by at least two vasoconstrictive stimuli, although with a different mechanism of action, in 82% of patients and spasm was induced by three or more stimuli in 39%. Tests were repeated in at least 23 patients and short-term reproducibility paralleled sensitivity. These results suggest that in patients with variant angina, a local nonspecific supersensitivity rather than an abnormal specific agonist-receptor interaction plays a major role in the genesis of coronary arterial spasm.

Now complete the following example-
input: Abstract: We developed methods for identifying beta-adrenergic receptors in human right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy tissue with the radioligand (-)[125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP). Specific ICYP binding in a crude, high-yield membrane preparation derived from endomyocardial biopsy tissue was high (specificity greater than 90%), of high affinity (KD around 20 pM), saturable and stereospecific for the (-) vs the (+) isomer of isoproterenol. Subjects with mild-moderate and severe biventricular dysfunction had respective decreases in beta-adrenergic receptor density of 38.2% and 57.7% when normalization methods were averaged, with no significant differences in ICYP dissociation constant. A subgroup of subjects was subdivided by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) into those with mild cardiac dysfunction (LVEF less than 0.50 greater than 0.40) and severe heart failure (LVEF less than 0.20) and given graded sequential infusions of dobutamine and calcium gluconate. Those with severe cardiac dysfunction had marked impairment of the dobutamine dP/dt and stroke work index response, whereas these responses to calcium did not differ in the two groups. These data indicate that in the intact human heart endomyocardial biopsy may be used for direct analysis of beta-adrenergic receptors, heart failure-associated myocardial beta-adrenergic down-regulation begins with mild-moderate ventricular dysfunction, reduction in myocardial beta-receptor density is related to degree of heart failure, and beta-receptor down-regulation is associated with pharmacologically specific impairment of the beta-agonist-mediated contractile response.

Now complete the following example-
input: Abstract: The afterload-corrected end-systolic volume index (ratio of end-systolic stress to end-systolic volume index [ESS/ESVI]) was previously useful in predicting outcome in patients with mitral regurgitation undergoing valve replacement. Therefore we tested ESS/ESVI together with standard hemodynamic variables as possible predictors of outcome in 39 patients with various valvular lesions who underwent valve replacement. Thirteen patients had preoperative mitral regurgitation, 16 had aortic stenosis, nine had aortic regurgitation, and one had mitral stenosis. Twenty-seven patients (group S) had a satisfactory outcome as defined by a return to NYHA class I or II together with a normal postoperative ejection fraction. Twelve patients who died, remained in class III or IV, or had a subnormal postoperative ejection fraction were deemed to have an unsatisfactory result (group U). Mean right atrial pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, end-diastolic volume index, end-systolic volume index (ESVI), and end-systolic wall stress were all greater in group U, whereas ESS/ESVI and ejection fraction were lower in group U. When these and other factors were submitted to stepwise discriminant multivariate analysis, ESS/ESVI and ESVI were the only independent predictors of outcome. However, when patients with mitral regurgitation (who might have biased the study) were excluded, discriminant analysis showed ESVI as the only independent predictive variable. We conclude that end-systolic indicators of ventricular function are superior to other standard hemodynamic variables in predicting outcome of valve replacement.
