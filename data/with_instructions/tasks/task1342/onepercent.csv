input: LOVE this case!  Have one for my phone and wanted to replace what I was using on my iPad.  So glad I did.  Love that my screen is protected and all the ports are covered.  Comes with a stand, but I put it in a drawer and never use it because of the extra bulk and weight. Do not miss it al all.  I put this in my Amazon cart and waited for the price to come down before purchasing. Got it for $48. Can't imagine anyone not liking this case!

The only negative I find is while creating Playlist on it (You can only create playlists on this device as it will not copy your playlists from iTunes). To create a playlist it opens up a list of all your songs in alphabetical order without any quick way to jump to a particular song. You have to scroll down each time you add a song to the list. No option to choose Album or Artist or anything else, only an alphabetical list of songs.

input: This compact laptop packs one hell of a punch. Though I am still getting used to Windows 8, I use this computer for everything. It is replacing my 15.6 inch Gateway laptop. The touchscreen is a plus. For me 2GB of RAM is sufficient so far, and there is plenty of room for storage on the 320GB hard drive. I must say I am impressed with this laptop so far and would definitely recommend to a friend. I am glad my husband convinced me to jump on the Gateway wagon!!!<br /><br />UPDATE 3 Weeks Later<br />I was really was really enjoying this laptop until it conked out on me. I went to log on and after I entered my password, the screen would turn blue and stay that way. I tried rebooting it, recharging it, and I even took the battery out, all to no avail. Hence, I returned it today and reduce my rating from five stars to one star. I should have known not to purchase the first release of an item since the manufacturer probably has more kinks to work out. Hope this helps.

input: Obviously, with a 5 star rating, I like this Kindle.    Here are my personal favorite features:    1) Prime TV Show/Movie Downloads - With a Prime Subscription, I can not only stream shows, but also DOWNLOAD shows to watch offline.  This is really great, especially when you're in spots with no wifi (like a bus stop, or plane, etc.)  The interface to manage shows is much better than the Prime website itself.    2) Sound - Wow!!! Sound is amazing when watching TV Shows or Movies.  Much better than an iPad.    3) Automatic App Updates - This was recently something added to iPads as well, but it's a great feature.  One less management task I have to do!    And here are a couple of my least favorite things:    1) Above anything else, the charging adapter....what where they thinking?  The USB port sticks out at an odd angle, making it difficult to plug in.  It's just very odd and makes charging annoying.    2) The battery life is ok, but not as good as my larger iPad by far.  What is sucking up so much battery?      Update - After a recent update to the Kindle OS, the battery life is MUCH better.

Now complete the following example-
input: Built products are put together well and use quality materials, which you'd expect because they're expensive.  But this bag has problems that make it less than ideal.<br /><br />I bought this to be a minimal bag, small, slim, and sleek.  But it's wider than it needs to be.  The straps attach in a way that flairs out of the top of the bag, making it wider than needed.  It also makes the bag an odd trapezoid shape.<br /><br />The second problem is, it's too tight. If your MacBook Air has a slim plastic case (like a Speck case).  A Speck case is very thin, yet its little extra size makes it very difficult to get the computer into and out of the Built bag.<br /><br />Another problem is the bag flap. It's too long.  It adds weight. It makes the bag harder to open and close.  If you put a computer power cord in the bag's front pockets, then the long flap won't stick and the flap sticks out unattractively.<br /><br />For me, this bag wasn't worth the high price.

It's flimsy only because it's foldable, like the picture. At first I couldn't get it to stand, but then I realized I folded it incorrectly and it stood up well. Magnet also keeps the folds together. The rilakkuma is cute and I really love this case! I've dropped my iPad a few times but the case hasn't broke. It's a very good case, because it's thin and light as well.

Now complete the following example-
input: The display image itself is very nice with very sharp images and vibrant colors. No complaints on the actual display (5 stars for the image). I use this monitor for work, and it is outstanding for viewing documents and web pages. I have not used it for gaming or watching movies, so I can't comment on the image quality for those uses. I really like the fact that this monitor uses a scant 27 W.    The display's physical housing however, is a major disappointment (1 star for the housing):   - The display is wobbly on the base.   - The tilt adjustment is super stiff. It takes 2 hands and more force than I'd like to apply to the wobbly base to adjust the tilt (one hand to hold the base and one hand to hold the bezel).   - The bezel and base are gloss black, so they show every single fingerprint and smudge. Samsung seems to be aware of this issue because they included a cleaning cloth with the monitor that is NOT for the display area, but for the bezel and base! Hey Samsung, skip the cleaning cloth and use a finish that does not highlight every fingerprint and smudge! Another downside of a gloss black bezel is that it reflects light from adjacent light fixtures and windows, which I find to be a distraction. I have half a mind to get out some 400 grit sand paper and take care of the gloss finish once and for all.  - The base is some stylish post modern curved design that cannot be used to put anything on (e.g. won't hold a pen, a note pad, a paperclip, or my reading glasses), and is therefore a useless waste of my desk space.   - The touch controls on the lower right side are exactly where I grab the monitor to adjust its position. Every time I do this, I accidently shut the monitor off or activate some on-screen adjustment. I prefer buttons in the lower middle to avoid this issue and show deference to our left-handed friends.  - There are no VESA mounts on the back (in case that matters to you).    Finally, the power cord includes a power converter brick in the middle ofthe cord, which is an inconvenience.    So, I love the display image and hate the housing on this monitor, resulting in 3 stars overall. If my complaints about the housing are not things that would bother you, go for it. If you prefer a housing with a stable and useful base, an easy tilt adjustment, a non-reflective bezel, and/or VESA mounts then you should pick a different monitor.
