Comes with a stand, but I put it in a drawer and never use it because of the extra bulk and weight. Do not miss it al all.  I put this in my Amazon cart and waited for the price to come down before purchasing. Got it for $48. Can't imagine anyone not liking this case!

The only negative I find is while creating Playlist on it (You can only create playlists on this device as it will not copy your playlists from iTunes). To create a playlist it opens up a list of all your songs in alphabetical order without any quick way to jump to a particular song. You have to scroll down each time you add a song to the list.

input: This compact laptop packs one hell of a punch. Though I am still getting used to Windows 8, I use this computer for everything. It is replacing my 15.6 inch Gateway laptop. The touchscreen is a plus. For me 2GB of RAM is sufficient so far, and there is plenty of room for storage on the 320GB hard drive. I must say I am impressed with this laptop so far and would definitely recommend to a friend. I am glad my husband convinced me to jump on the Gateway wagon!!!<br /><br />UPDATE 3 Weeks Later<br />I was really was really enjoying this laptop until it conked out on me. I went to log on and after I entered my password, the screen would turn blue and stay that way. I tried rebooting it, recharging it, and I even took the battery out, all to no avail. Hence, I returned it today and reduce my rating from five stars to one star. I should have known not to purchase the first release of an item since the manufacturer probably has more kinks to work out. Hope this helps.

input: Obviously, with a 5 star rating, I like this Kindle.    Here are my personal favorite features:    1) Prime TV Show/Movie Downloads - With a Prime Subscription, I can not only stream shows, but also DOWNLOAD shows to watch offline.  This is really great, especially when you're in spots with no wifi (like a bus stop, or plane, etc.)  The interface to manage shows is much better than the Prime website itself.    2) Sound - Wow!!! Sound is amazing when watching TV Shows or Movies.  Much better than an iPad.    3) Automatic App Updates - This was recently something added to iPads as well, but it's a great feature.  One less management task I have to do!    And here are a couple of my least favorite things:    1) Above anything else, the charging adapter....what where they thinking?  The USB port sticks out at an odd angle, making it difficult to plug in.  It's just very odd and makes charging annoying.    2) The battery life is ok, but not as good as my larger iPad by far.  What is sucking up so much battery?      Update - After a recent update to the Kindle OS, the battery life is MUCH better.

Now complete the following example-
input: Built products are put together well and use quality materials, which you'd expect because they're expensive.  But this bag has problems that make it less than ideal.<br /><br />I bought this to be a minimal bag, small, slim, and sleek.  But it's wider than it needs to be.  The straps attach in a way that flairs out of the top of the bag, making it wider than needed.  It also makes the bag an odd trapezoid shape.<br /><br />The second problem is, it's too tight. If your MacBook Air has a slim plastic case (like a Speck case).  A Speck case is very thin, yet its little extra size makes it very difficult to get the computer into and out of the Built bag.<br /><br />Another problem is the bag flap. It's too long.  It adds weight. It makes the bag harder to open and close.  If you put a computer power cord in the bag's front pockets, then the long flap won't stick and the flap sticks out unattractively.<br /><br />For me, this bag wasn't worth the high price.

It's flimsy only because it's foldable, like the picture. At first I couldn't get it to stand, but then I realized I folded it incorrectly and it stood up well. Magnet also keeps the folds together. The rilakkuma is cute and I really love this case! I've dropped my iPad a few times but the case hasn't broke. It's a very good case, because it's thin and light as well.

Now complete the following example-
input: The display image itself is very nice with very sharp images and vibrant colors. No complaints on the actual display (5 stars for the image). I use this monitor for work, and it is outstanding for viewing documents and web pages. I have not used it for gaming or watching movies, so I can't comment on the image quality for those uses. I really like the fact that this monitor uses a scant 27 W.    The display's physical housing however, is a major disappointment (1 star for the housing):   - The display is wobbly on the base.   - The tilt adjustment is super stiff. It takes 2 hands and more force than I'd like to apply to the wobbly base to adjust the tilt (one hand to hold the base and one hand to hold the bezel).   - The bezel and base are gloss black, so they show every single fingerprint and smudge. Samsung seems to be aware of this issue because they included a cleaning cloth with the monitor that is NOT for the display area, but for the bezel and base! Hey Samsung, skip the cleaning cloth and use a finish that does not highlight every fingerprint and smudge! Another downside of a gloss black bezel is that it reflects light from adjacent light fixtures and windows, which I find to be a distraction. I have half a mind to get out some 400 grit sand paper and take care of the gloss finish once and for all.  - The base is some stylish post modern curved design that cannot be used to put anything on (e.g. won't hold a pen, a note pad, a paperclip, or my reading glasses), and is therefore a useless waste of my desk space.   - The touch controls on the lower right side are exactly where I grab the monitor to adjust its position. Every time I do this, I accidently shut the monitor off or activate some on-screen adjustment. I prefer buttons in the lower middle to avoid this issue and show deference to our left-handed friends.  - There are no VESA mounts on the back (in case that matters to you).    Finally, the power cord includes a power converter brick in the middle ofthe cord, which is an inconvenience.    So, I love the display image and hate the housing on this monitor, resulting in 3 stars overall. If my complaints about the housing are not things that would bother you, go for it. If you prefer a housing with a stable and useful base, an easy tilt adjustment, a non-reflective bezel, and/or VESA mounts then you should pick a different monitor.

Now complete the following example-
input: I love my HP 17&#34; Pavilion laptop, it is a workhorse and travels everywhere with me, but as things do the OEM battery finally stopped taking a charge and I had to find a replacement for an &#34;obsolete&#34; part.  I replaced the original 8 cell battery with this 12 cell, and it has been a perfect match!  I followed the instructions for charging and completely depleting the battery a few times and it has taken and held a 100% charge since.  With the additional cells the battery profile has added about 3/4&#34; to the bottom of my laptop.  This actually works out nicely because it raises the back of the laptop slightly and makes the angle of the keyboard more comfortable (for me) to type on and gives a little more airflow for the fan to ventilate the unit.  The price point for this battery was a significant bonus, as the the HP version (if you can find one) is upwards of $70.  All things considered, this was the right purchase for me, and if I'm still using this laptop when this battery wears out, I would purchase again.

Now complete the following example-
input: There's a lot to like about this case in terms of its aesthetics and overall design.  I should start by saying I haven't personally experienced this issues some customers have reported with the Kindle coming free of the case.  The Kindle and case secure to each other magnetically and, at least on the one I got, it's a secure fit.  I also haven't dropped my Kindle, so I can't speak to how well the case would protect the device in a fall, althogh it seems like it would probably be adequate in most cases.<br /><br />Some things I like about the case (in addition to the previously mentioned aesthetics) are the loop for a stylus, and the clever folding back that allows the Kindle to stand either horizontally for media viewing or vertically for reading.  I also like the way the Kindle keyboard fits into the case completing the set.  BUT...<br /><br />The devil's in the details, and some of the details end up being problematic.  The folding stand can't be used whiile the keyboard is in place, which isn't a huge deal, but might be a consideration for some customers.  A larger issue (which I also mentioned in my review of the keyboard itself) is the way in which the keyboard attaches to the case.  In order for the keyboard to magetically lock to the case, it is placed with the keys facing OUT, away from the case.  So, if you're using your Kindle as a reading device, or holding it on a plane, for example, and you have the keyboard attached, the case is folded open in such a way that your fingers are constantly pushing keys on the keyboard.  Naturally, this wakes the keyboard and can cause all sorts of problems.  Since the keyboard can't easily be used while it is in the case  anyway, it's too bad they didn't make it mount (or at least ABLE to mount in a position that would leave the keys inaccessible when it is mounted.<br /><br />That issue asiide, the case looks good, works well and has been a good companion to my Kindle.

The sleep function does work; simply close the case and the kindle will sleep, some sort of magic I reckon.<br /><br />There's nothing wrong with this case, it looks good, feels good, and functions well. Despite some reviews this case CAN be a stand in PORTRAIT and LANDSCAPE. For landscape you merely &#34;pinch&#34; the cover inwards. For portrait you &#34;pinch&#34; the cover outwards. I wanted to say the portrait stand was wobbly, but I smacked the kindle around while in portrait and it handled it like some sumo-gyroscope hybrid thus 5 stars.

Now complete the following example-
input: I like this tablet. It actually feels like I'm drawing on paper. The pen glides easily on the tablet; however, sometimes the tablet senses the pen too easily/soon, so I end up with unwanted nodes/lines when I'm just trying to carefully place the pen slowly to the tablet surface. I don't care much for the buttons on the pen, but I know that it can be more practical to use them. It bothers me when I grasp the pen and accidentally touch one of the buttons. Right now I use mainly the keyboard features (to delete, clear a node, etc.) until I feel comfortable enough to use the pen buttons. Overall, this is a nice tool for digital art.
output: ",Nice tool for digital art

Now complete the following example-
input: Bought two of them. One stopped being recognized after about 8 months (powers Dell laptop but not recognized so doesn't charge battery). Got my full money back since it was still under warranty.<br /><br />I believe the problem is in the third (innermost) wire inside the plug that sends the digital signal ID telling the DELL laptop that the charger is valid. Either their is a break somewhere in the wire or the chip that generates the ID inside the adapter is fried. The problem is mostly DELL's fault for requiring an ID to charge which is more about increasing the sales of DELL-branded adapters than providing any type of added (protection).<br /><br />So while I blame the adapter manufacturer in part for making a cheap adapter (but hey I only paid about 6.50), I blame Dell just as much for their anti-competitive tricks.

Now complete the following example-
input: I haven't had the drive long enough to write a proper review but I felt I could help by clearing some things up.  #1, this drive does NOT have a power button on it.  To the person who says it does, did you actually look in the manual and/or push the button?  It's not power, it's the Maxtor One Touch button.  Maybe you have a different model.<br />And to the person who claimed that the drive isn't USB 2.0, I'm sorry but that's completely wrong.  The drive is 2.0 and backwards compatible to 1.x.  To get 2.0 performance you need a USB 2.0 port in your computer!!!  They put an asterisk on the box to inform you that if you have 1.1 and want to ugprade to 2.0 they have a card (PCI USB 2.0) they will sell you.  I'm sure it was frustrating for you to discover that your PC only had a 1.x USB port and you needed to buy something additional.  But a good portion (I would say most) of folks know that to get USB 2.0 speed you need to have a USB 2.0 port.  If a company sells you a UDMA 133 IDE drive and you're on UDMA 66 or 100 you're going to get reduced speed until you upgrade your IDE.  The person said they replaced it with a Western Digital Drive, but unless that box came with a USB 2.0 PCI card included the results would have been the same.<br />I've had the drive 1 week so far it seems good and the transfer speed at USB 2.0 is good.  Hopefully it will last.

Now complete the following example-
input: The case is good for protecting the tablet in transit...the elastic band is helpful to keep it closed. However, I mainly got a case like this so I could prop it up in the kitchen & follow recipes. I liked the idea of having multiple positions/angles that it could be propped up at...unfortunately, this case doesn't work well at the steeper angle. If I prop it up it sometimes slips, and it definitely slips if I have it propped up & am using it w/ the stylus or my finger. Otherwise, I can deal with it at the lower angle most of the time...and like I said, when closed it offers good protection for everyday moving around / throwing in my purse, backpack, breifcase, etc. I like the color, and the stylus slides nicely on the outside at the fold...overall decent deal for the price.
output: ","Good, not great"

I also have the 2012 Nexus 7 and the power/usb port is getting a tad sloppy from the need to charge it every day for the last year of use. Unfortunately the original Nexus 7 can not use this wireless charger but it will help prevent my new one from suffering the same wear and tear on the usb/charger port.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

Since I often travel with my laptop, I wanted something to replace my bulky laptop bag, but also something that would protect my computer, rather than just having it bounce around inside my packpack.  This laptop sleeve was just the thing.  It fits my 15.6\\"" Dell perfectly and has a slim profile.  I find it fits into my Maxpedition Kodiak Gearslinger, and is easy to extract when going through a security check point at airports.  For under $20.00, it's a good solution for anybody trying to cut down on their baggage articles without compromising the physical security of their laptop.

input: I purchased this drive to keep a backup of my Aperture library while I am on scuba vacations. I would hate to lose my MacBook Pro AND all my photos from the trip so this is extra insurance to have a copy of everything. The drive is fairly compact however there are some portable drives out there that are smaller if you need something really compact. Included is a nice rubber cover that will protect the drive from drops but it does take away some of the portability factor. There are three included cables so you won't need anything extra to get going.<br />I plugged the drive in via the Firewire 800 and waited for it to mount. It took about 15 seconds to mount and then was ready to go. It is bus powered so it does not require any separate power supply, just plug into your computer and let the drive mount to use. I began copying some files to test the drive. It was very fast and worked just as promised, preformatted for the Mac and ready to go. I will report back on speed and longer term performance as I use the drive more but so far it is a worthy purchase.

The mouse does not have a high quality feel, in that it is not contoured to fit the hand, nor does it have tactile surfaces, but I can't complain because of the price.  Overall it has met my needs and at under $20 it has met my expectations.

It can be frustrating to put on, and be prepared to see the prismatic effect on most all light colours, or anything that isn't black - It's not just white that makes the bad effect obvious. Save yourself $20 and don't buy this. You might think you can deal with the visual interference, but I suspect that most people will not appreciate it at all.

Now complete the following example-
input: I just received the TP-Link AC 1200 Dual Band Wireless Router nicely packaged from Amazon.  I opened the box, laid out all the gear inside, and began the process of installing the router.<br /><br />Other reviewers have mentioned how easy it is to set up this router and they are correct for those people who are replacing an existing router with the new TP-Link reviewed here.  For those folks new to using a router, TP-Link makes your task easy by providing you with a Resource CD which takes you step by step through the installation process.<br /><br />Even though I have a router already in place, I decided to use the CD just to be sure that I got the maximum benefit from this new router.  I was pleased with the systematic and clear directions given on the installation Wizard.  In about ten minutes or less the Wizard told me installation was complete.<br /><br />Now to test the router, which is located in a third floor office in my home.  I went down to the first floor and turned on a HP Laptop with a Windows 7 operating system.  After initializing the computer to accept the new router, I opened Google first and then AOL.  Both browsers opened quickly, not quite as fast as the desktop computer that I am using to write this review, but fast nonetheless.  Good start.<br /><br />I decided to first bring up a video from YouTube - John Denver playing \\""The Bells of Rhymney.\\""  Perfect picture and excellent sound.  Next I went to NetFlix and clicked on \\""Grand Hotel,\\"" a new Spanish film.  Again, excellent picture quality and sound.  The TP-Link works just as advertised.<br /><br />What about customer service?  Often it is difficult or impossible to get anyone on the phone to help if difficulty with new equipment is encountered.  Not so with TP-Link.  I was quickly connected to a tech adviser who talked to me about various features of this router.  He was competent and friendly.  I decided that if I ran into any problems with the router, help would be easily available.<br /><br />Bottom line.  Fast and easy to install, the TP-Link AC 1200 Dual Band Wireless Router works as advertised.  How will it hold up over time?  I will come back and update this review in a couple of months to discuss reliability issues with Amazon readers./>Bottom line.

Now complete the following example-
input: This kit consists of an indoor camera/transmitter, a USB receiver for your PC and software. I'm a PC expert, but a security system novice. Here are my observations:<br /><br />Setup:<br /><br />Setup requires the following steps:<br />1) Find a place to mount the indoor camera. It must be within 10 feet of a power outlet, no exceptions. Mount the camera, plug it in the wall.<br />2) Load the software on your PC. The PC must be running Windows XP (any variety) or Vista. The installation is relatively painless.<br />3) Plug the receiver module into the wall and connect the receiver to your PC via USB.<br /><br />Comments:<br /><br />A) The requirement that the camera be within 10 feet of a wall outlet will create issues for some. It certainly did for me: There was no convenient outlet near the front door, which is where I would have preferred to mount the camera. (Remember that even if you have a convenient outlet, the cord is only 10 feet long, and you may not want the cord draped along the floor or whatever). As a result, I mounted the camera on the second floor to look down on the entryway porch--not my favorite choice, but good enough for now.<br />B) Because this system uses power-line ethernet (it uses the power lines in your home to do the networking), it is subject to the standard bugaboos of that approach, namely the connection can become flakey if you use certain appliances on your line (hair dryers are bad, for example), and the quality of the connection can also vary depending on where the transmitter and receiver are relative to the wiring.<br />C) The installation was relatively painless, but does require reboots and downloads to update the software.<br />D) You should plan for the PC to which you attach the receiver to be on 24/7, or at least at any time you want the camera system to work. If you expect to use this as a security monitoring system when you are gone, I would strongly recommend you put your PC on a good quality uninterruptable power supply (note that the receiver unit MUST be plugged directly into the wall, not the UPS, so if your power goes out, you will NOT get any camera feed until power is restored. But at least if your PC is on a UPS, transmission can start up again automatically when the power is restored).<br /><br />Use:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) I was surprised at the good quality image I was getting from the camera, given the inexpensive nature of this kit and the relatively low light in the area to which it was pointed. Thumbs up.<br />2) The control software is relative easy to use. Thumbs up.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) This kit promises you can view your camera's output remotely. To me, that was probably the coolest thing. You could be in another city and keep an eye on your home. HOWEVER, it turns out that the only thing you can do without spending more money is watch the camera real-time. You can adjust the camera, and you can't review the video that your camera has captured remotely without paying $80/year to unlock additional features. I hate hidden cost software unlocks that are required to obtain the full usefulness of a product. This, in my opinion, pushes this kit down a full star (at least) in usefulness.<br /><br />2) No sound. I am not sure why I expected this kit to capture sound, and I am not even sure if it matters, but it was disappointing to discover that the camera is video only. I consider this a minor nit.<br /><br />Overall, I found that this kit exceeded my expectations in terms of the quality of the video that it captures, but that the powerline networking (with the limitation of a 10 foot power cord for the camera) and the $80 unlocking fee before remote operation is useful considerably reduce my overall happiness with the device. If they were to introduce a camera that used standard 802.1g wireless networking (either battery operated or capable of using a longer power cord), that would considerably increase the usefulness of the camera. If they would also stop with the $80 fee and just include all the features with the package (even if the package was priced higher), that could address the second issue.hat could address the second issue.
output: ",Good product if you can live with the limitations; aggrevating $80/year extra charge for certain options

input: I've had this laptop for over a month and the results can't be better. Great screen, no lag, good speed, one think I'm very happy with its the keyboard excellent. I don't understand why so many bad reviews for Windows 8, it's a change but you just have to adapt. And when you get how to use it it's fine. No need of so many bad reviews. I'm thinking in buy a 4gb more of ram for the laptop, not because it need more memory just because I think that I will increase the life of the laptop.
output: ",Great laptop. I'm very happy with this item.

I want to use it for presentations and I don't like carry my 15inch laptop to school just to open a word or excel file.<br />I did a long research over similar devices, like Miix, Venue, Acer W4 and I choose this one because of GPS and micro HDMI. And I am really glad I made this choice. It feels comfortable in my hands, it is noticeably heavier than Ipad Mini, but weight didnt bother so far.<br />One of issues is hearing a cracking sound (sometimes) when touching corner of screen which I don't like.<br />Battery is really good, performance is superb! and interestingly even for all old windows applications (not metro ones) I clicked with 100% accuracy on menus, buttons and everything.<br />Because I needed to demo some of my applications written in OpenGL, I searched internet and some websites say it has Open GL ES, but it actually support OpenGL up to ver 4.0. And interestingly I could run Skyrim on it, with low setting really good!<br /><br />Update 2:<br />Good news! You can make screen mirroring (either via hdmi or miracast) with installing newest intel drivers. Unfortunatly toshiba did not as of now provide them. But oyu can grab them from dell venue 8 pro website (.exe file called Intel Platform Driver Installer , version 12/2/2013) and extract content of .exe file, then with have disk method update graphics driver from .inf file located at \GFX directory.<br />Although you have to change resoulutions from intel graphics options.<br /><br />Update 1:<br />I havent heard that cracking sound anymore. Maybe it just takes time to fix itself.<br />Also If you are having trouble with connecting your mobile phone to device with bluetooh (which I had with my Galaxy S4) try searching for<br />\\""iogear bluetooth driver 12.0.0.8030\\"" it is actually lat4est version  of broadcam bluetooth I could find.

There are 2 big advantages in buying one.  1) It is powered by your Computer via a USB cable and does not require you to upload via your camera, so you can save your camera's batteries.  2) It transfers images from the CF to the PC at a significantly faster rate than the camera. Without keeping track of time I would say it is 2/3 rds quicker with a CF reader than using a conventional usb transfer via the camera.  My only regret is that I did not buy this product sooner.

Now complete the following example-
input: I purchased this as a gift for my brother and his wife.  The purpose was for them to be able to back up their pictures of their new born child.  They were just storing all of their pictures on a desktop and the camera memory cards.<br /><br />I suggested that they follow the same routine that I do with all of my pictures.  They can save the pictures to their computer and then organize them by year then month.  Every couple of weeks they plug this drive in a back up their pictures.  While they are not using this drive they should keep it unplugged from their computer and in their safe.  (Another tip I gave them was that every year they should buy a USB thumb drive and save the previous calendar year to it as well).<br /><br />Using this drive in this fashion does not take advantage of any of the software features that it comes with nor does it touch on the life expectancy of it.  What it does though is allow for you to back up a ton of priceless pictures that would be devastating to lose.<br /><br />For us, the cost is great for what you get.  I have used many WD Passports and have never had a problem.<br /><br />-One tip that I will offer and you can take it if you wish...  I would not leave this (or any) USB drive plugged into your computer all of the time.  When you are not using the data that is on it it is best unplug it.  These drives have moving parts in them and the more they are used the more wear they take on.  Doing this will prolong their life.
output: ",great for backup (if you don't leave it plugged in all of the time)

input: Added hours and hours to my FiOS DVRs recording capability. I have so many shows recorded now it's outrageous and gives me the freedom to record shows without having to worry about space or deleting something.<br /><br />I tried using an external ESATA box I had laying around with a hard drive, and it worked for a while, but even after trying two drives, they would eventually failed after a couple months causing the UI to stutter and pause and make even going to the guide almost impossible- and playback was a slideshow. So now, after months later of 24/7 use, I can say this recommended solution of the MyBook DVR Expander has been flawless and there have been zero problems. I don't know if these DVR's require a special firmware on the drives or if I just had really bad luck with two drives go bad right after the other, but I do know using this DVR expander has given me zero trouble and works just as advertised - plug and play. Highly recommended.

Its comfortable for long nights of gaming, for CS the triple shoot button works great. The quick sensitivity changing button also works great.  I never really felt the need of weights in a mouse and these dont have them anyway.  I think its just a way for companies to charge more for a mouse.  The 500hz also helps - can actually tell a difference in game. Overall good build and great for gaming.

I had a Netgear N300 extender before and the signal was weak and the connection kept dropping even though I had no problems connecting to my fios modem/router which was giving out a weak signal.

input: Worked perfectly for 47 days. Then stopped totally. Amazon finally agreed to refund, but it took me a half hour on the phone to accomplish this. The company itself - &#34;ADATA&#34; had no phone number and no way to get ahold of them thru Amazon?  Found them (Google search) to be located in China. Even on their website there was no opportunity to get a refund. The USB drive rated 4.3 stars but when I checked the company, it had MANY more negative reviews then I would even care to mention. My thought in being a long satisfied Amazon customer is that they should give us an up front review of both product and seller.

Then again, Belkin usually makes really great things for Apple products.

input: Very happy with this small laptop.  It's just the right size to take with me whether around town or on vacation.  The large harddrive is great to put everything I want on it with room to spare, I even put Photoshop CS6 and all my iTunes on it.  Better to have too much room than not enough.  I put Windows 8 on my desktop a while back after purchasing a touchscreen for it and I do like Windows 8 now that I have had a chance to get a little used to it, I still have much to learn.  For the price this laptop is a very good deal.  I thought I might replace the harddrive with a SSD but now that I've had a chance to use it I don't think I will need to do that.  If you are on the fence about ordering this I can tell you I would not hesitate to recommend it.

I've done just about everything I can think of to make this thing functional, searched the web and D-Links site for solutions... but to no avail.

input: The Asus 1000HA Netbook is a cute little device that provides all the essential tasks I need as a college student.    - I needed something light   - Something I could bring to lectures and type up notes   - Something that wouldn't put a damper on my wallet (one of the main reasons I purchased this one)   - And something that would make transfers to my desktop as easy as possible  The Asus did all these things    Everything is pretty easy to use (still getting the hang of the extra Eee features the netbook came with).  The keyboard is nice and big compared to most netbooks and the zoom feature on the touchpad is pretty niffty.    I have had a few 'issues' with the netbook though...   I was kind of irked about the fact that the battery life is more like 6 hours than the advertised 8.. I also had to reinstall the Synaptics Mouse driver because after installing my AT&T AirCard the touch pad just crapped out and refused to work. I also had to reinstall The APCI driver (works the keyboard) because the function keys stopped working. Both were easy to fix though.. just went to the Synaptics and the ASUS website and they had repair drivers there and easy to find.  Also, The webcam didn't come with any software? What's with that?      One thing I did really like though is the battery life-- I was going to purchase the same make and model from BestBuy for $299 but it came with 4 hours less of batter life- 4 HOURS! For $30 more and the sacrifice of a megapixel in the webcam I got this one. I'm still happy with my purchase, but we'll see what challenges this little PC will conjure up down the road.

input: I wasn't really paying attention when I ordered these and so when stickers arrived I was surprised. I attached them and they are ok but not great. They are a fraction wide for my keyboard so they start attached perfectly down the middle but then as you go out in either direction the are up to a centimeter off. My concern with these is more for when I decide to remove them, I have a feeling it will leave a sticky goo behind.
output: ",Just OK.

input: Just received this product yesterday. Fit the tablet very nicely out of the box. Bluetooth on tablet hooked right up and worked well. For $25, this is a very solid product. The case feels nice and durable (not saying the tablet would be 100% protected if dropped) and is not too bulky to carry around. The reason for only giving 4 stars is that I don't know how this product will hold up over the long haul since I just received it. I would definitely recommend the product. Great price for a nice case

Thankfully, there are three screen covers in the package, so I can try again.  I would recommend this vendor again.

I ended up spending too much time trying to line up the pointer and click ... this was especially true on smaller buttons.   I suspect that a thumb just isn't the best choice for fine motor control once you've reached a certain age, and the small ball made this even more obvious.  In fairness, I am \\""north of 50\\"" and someone younger might have a different experience ... as the other reviews bear out.  So for me, the ball was jumpy and erratic ... not a good choice.  Better software ... something with greater control of acceleration could certainly help, but I wan't able to do much with Logitech's included application.   I've returned the unit and am looking for a second choice.

Now complete the following example-
input: I've owned about 3 different ACER laptops. All of them were great, but this one takes it to the next level.<br />------------------------------------<br />Windows 8:<br /><br />This laptop, when I first received it was very good. It worked, keyboard is very accurate, touchpad takes some getting used to. Windows 8 is OKAY. But the changes from windows 7 are a bit disappointing. It just doesn't have that &#34;windows feel&#34; anymore. I think Microsoft should rethink/rework the Windows 8 operating system a bit. It's too much to take in, and quite frankly, I think Microsoft is trying to 'copy' what Apple is doing; they're taking it way too far.<br /><br />Immediately, I was disappointed with Metro. I absolutely cannot manage without the start menu! As well, with this laptop, using metro is kind of difficult. The touch pad is kind of all over the place sometimes, and takes you some place you don't want to go. Basically, I'd just tap the touch pad gently and end up clicking something in metro accidentally. This caused me so much frustration!!!<br /><br />Overall, Windows 8 was just a huge disappointment to me. I don't know about anyone else, but I need more leeway when I use a computer.<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />Linux Mint:<br /><br />So after about 2 weeks, I tried Linux. I put Linux Mint on it, and surprisingly, it worked really well!! However, the brightness and touchpad were not working properly. I managed to fix the brightness, but the touchpad was a bit buggy still. The problem with the touchpad was scrolling and right click. Right Click wouldn't work unless you used 'two fingers'. Which meant I had to tap the touch pad with two fingers. It was a minor annoyance. The wireless was another major issue. For some reason in Linux, the wireless card would constantly drop. And it also would take for ever to reconnect. The only way to reconnect fast enough was to restart the whole system.<br /><br />So pretty much, Linux needs a bit of updates for this laptop. The touchpad really works against you and does what ever it wants from time to time in Linux. And the wireless issue was just a huge turn off.<br /><br />--------------------------------<br /><br />Windows 7 downgrade:<br /><br />And finally, 2 days ago, I downgraded back to windows 7. And guess what? IT WORKS FLAWLESSLY!!! It wasn't an actual downgrade, I had an OEM copy of windows 7 with a key to use. The performance difference between windows 7 and 8 on this laptop are VERY noticeable. Windows 8 kind of lags in desktop mode. But on Windows 7, I get no more lag, and everything runs smoothly.<br /><br />Acer is such a great company when it comes to drivers. Most companies will not provide Windows 7 drivers. The reason for this is because they want to force you to use windows 8. Acer however, understands a users preference, and offers Windows 7 drivers in case you feel uncomfortable with windows 8. SO ACER GETS MY THUMBS UP!<br /><br />All the drivers work, and I find the touch pad responds a lot better in Windows 7, compared to Windows 8 and Linux. Windows 7 works very well on this laptop, and I do recommend it if you want to downgrade to windows 7.<br /><br />All I did was plug in an external USB cd-rom, and installed windows 7 pretty much that way. It's very simple.<br /><br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />PROS AND CONS<br /><br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1)Sleek<br />2)Runs decent<br />3)Intel HD 4000 can actually run some games. I'm not saying on high settings. Played Guild Wars 2, Left 4 dead, Killing Floor, etc; and they all run pretty well on this on low-med settings. But this isn't a gaming laptop, so don't expect anything like eye-candy gaming experience. This laptop serves it's purpose for me quite well.<br />4)i5 processor is SO GOOD!!!<br />5)USB 3, Bluetooth and HDMI<br />6)Overall Sexy silver look<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1)A bit flimsy (try not to rest anything heavy on it)<br />2)Network NIC (not the wireless). For some reason, an RJ45 cable refuses to fit properly in it. Don't know if that is a design flaw, or maybe I need better network cables.<br />3)Keyboard will betray you a few times. But this isn't a major con, it just takes some getting used to if you have big hands.<br />4)Battery could be better<br />5)....Wait stop. There are no more cons!<br /><br />Yeah this laptop is too good for any big cons. It's a very decent semi-Ultra Book.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br /><br />One more thing I noticed with this laptop, is it cannot get dirty! I usually leave my work spaces kind of messy after use. But this laptop has such a clean feel to it, you can hardly notice if there is a mess on it. I've had dust, pieces of hair, even some potato chips fall on it. It comes off very easily. Also, the Keyboard is fitted in a way, where it is impossible for any mess to get inside the laptop. Acer designed this so well, it's almost Dirt-Resistant!<br /><br />I don't normally make reviews on Amazon, so please consider getting this laptop. It will not disappoint you, even if you like windows 8!
output: ","Acer is so GOOD, they even allow you to downgrade to windows 7. Linux works too!!"

I wish I'd known before I bought: the battery isn't lasting as long between recharges as my wife's Kindle with keypad, and the touch screen technology seems inconsistent.  For instance, sometimes a 'tap' will turn over more than one page, sometimes even a firm tap will not turn the page, and sometimes the time taken to turn the page is so long that I repeat my 'tap' and get 2 page turns.  You'll need time to 'learn to tap'.

Now complete the following example-
input: I put off setting this system up because in reading the manuals and the reviews it was apparent that there are a lot of details to consider in getting the most out of it, many of which require some knowledge of the technical workings. It's a flexible system with lots of options. For now I just want top use it for backup, but it can do much more.<br /><br />I finally went with the simplest option to start with, the basic setup with default settings and, for my Mac, a Time Machine backup. Even that had a few wrinkles, such as deciding how much space to allocate for Time Machine. (For those who use Time Machine, ReadyNAS helpfully automatically sets up a portion of the drives of the size the user specifies. By default Time Machine would use all the space available on the drives.)<br /><br />The setup and Time Machine backup went smoothly, no glitches. I needed to consult the ReadyNAS software manual (available online), and in some cases had to hunt a bit for the right button to click next.<br /><br />The fan that operates whenever the unit is on has a soft but quite noticeable sound.<br /><br />The two 1-TB drives that came with this system are [[ASIN:B008LA60NW Toshiba DT01ACA100 7200 RPM drives]] (from November and December 2013). User reviews at Amazon and NewEgg suggest these aren't the ultimate in reliability, though they generally perform well. They make the redundancy of the default X-RAID configuration desirable. (In that configuration, the total data that can be stored on the two 1-TB drives is only 1 TB because of the redundant storage. If one drive fails, all the data can be recovered from the other.)<br /><br />The Toshiba drives are supposed to be energy efficient, which is good, because the ReadyNAS keeps them spinning continually when the unit is on. You can schedule times for the unit to power up and down, and you can remotely shut it down fairly easily. Remotely powering it up is a little trickier, but can be done via Wake on LAN. NetGear says they're working on a disk spindown option for their next software update (6.2.0).<br /><br />Screws are included to mount 2.5\\"" drives.<br /><br />The power cord is helpfully long, a little over 11 feet, in two pieces with a power brick in the middle.<br /><br />The construction is solid.working on a disk spindown option for their next software update (6.2.0).<br /><br />Screws are included to mount 2.5\\"" drives.<br /><br />The power cord is helpfully long, a little over 11 feet, in two pieces with a power brick in the middle.<br /><br />The construction is solid.

input: Overall I've been pleased with the cover.  It was easy to install and fits neatly onto my Fire.  One complaint is that that back brace doesn't hold up well if you try to set it up on a flat surface.  I don't use it much that way since I pretty much have it in hand, but there are times when I'd like to use as a stand up screen.  Also, the flexible side of the cover isn't very thick, so for carrying purposes my partner made a simple padded bag into which it fits tightly, with one side marked with a 'T' so I know it's the top.

We wasted 10+ hours on the phone with them, all the while they tried pushing the problem onto us before (finally!) getting permission to return the computer so they can fix the problem.    Then, when the computer returned, we had to, of course, go through all the hassle, yet again, of loading and reloading software. Another 7 months went by and now, the computer's on the blink - again! This time, problem reading the CD/DVD drive!  My question is - did tech support actually fixed the problem or just re-installed re-cond parts?  Or is this an inherent problem in ALL Compaq computers?  Can't wait to waste yet another 10+ hours with their lovely support people again!    Last word  - \\""Should have bought a Dell!\\""

It is perfect in the landscape position. In the verticle position it is a bit wobbly and probably would need to be unplugged from the charger. I rarely use the stand in the verticle position so it wasn't that important to me.  That is the only reason I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars.

We had previously bought a Ugee M708, and were pleasantly surprised at how good it was for the price, having owned a similar, and much more expensive Wacom tablet. We decided to give this a go since the comparable Cintiq is 4x the cost. It is a great tablet. No noticeable lag, nice adjustable stand, comfortable pen, huge screen. We had a slight problem with it syncing up to Adobe Flash, but Ugee customer service helped fix it right away, and everything works perfectly. We could not have been happier with the care we received from them. The customer service is outstanding, some of the best I have ever encountered. I would definitely recommend this product to others. I will update this if we run in to any other issues.

Now complete the following example-
input: I'd like to start off by saying I've previously owned both the Logitech G930 and Corsair 2100 Wireless Headsets.<br /><br />Both of those headsets had their own flaws. The G930 would constantly disconnect and reconnect and after normal daily use the mic would physically break at its weak point since half of the mic was made out of hard plastic and the other half soft bendable plastic, boy oh boy that was a huge mistake. The 2100 on the other hand didn't suffer from these connection problems or cheap mic construction, but the sound isolation wasn't as good as the G930's due to the ear cups being made out of cloth instead of leatherette. The 2100 was also less comfortable due to an unusually strong clamping force which never really lessened.<br /><br />I'm incredibly glad to say with the utmost joy that the SteelSeries H Wireless Headset doesn't share ANY of those faults and is the best headset I've ever owned by FAR. Not only is it exempt from those flaws, it outperforms in other areas as well. The sound quality is noticeably better, even only by a little, it is better than either previous headset. In addition, my favorite thing about this headset is the interchangeable battery! I NEVER have to go wired again... I just LOVE it!<br /><br />My review is only based on PC use as I don't use it on consoles. If your wondering whether or not the price is justified and if it is worth it only for use on the PC, let me tell you right now it IS worth it.
output: ",My search for the perfect headset is over.

Now complete the following example-
input: This product works fine. It only took 2 days to ship in and even came in a day early. In my box i got two sheets. One is a dust removal one and the other is the actual protector. But in reality, you can use the dust removal sheet as an actual protector also, so you're really getting two protector sheets. The thing i liked is that the intended protector sheet as a back peel and a front peel. I like this because i install the back peel on perfectly with no air bubbles. Then instead of peeling off the front one, i just left it on, then like in a couple months when it gets super dirty or something i'll just peel it off, and it'll be the actual protector that is on and be clean all over again. Then if something else goes wrong i'll use the dirt removal one. The protector is not too thin, not too thick, just right.  The only thing bad i have to say about this is that the screen protector is about like 1cm too small, so it doesn't cover the whole screen 100%, but i didn't really care because i think if it did, it would be harder to install because you need absolute perfection, so having that 1cm gives you room to breathe. So although it doesn't 100% of the screen 99% works just fine for me. Overall,i do think this was def worth the buy, but then again, i got mine for 20.00. Works great, just don't know if i would pay 30.00 for it, but i guess technically your getting two.

Now complete the following example-
input: Overall I'm satisfied with the computer. It gets the job done. The weakest aspect of the device is the screen - it has a very narrow viewing \\""sweet spot.\\"" I constantly fidget with the screen to find the right viewing angle. For comparison: my old HP DV9000 from 2007 had a much better viewing angle. Mind you, this isn't a deal breaker. As I said, it gets the job done. Although I'm glad I got it at a substantial discount on Black Friday 2012. I wouldn't pay full retail price, primarily because of the weak screen.  For this reason alone, I've deducted one star. Perhaps for a laptop under $1,000, I was expecting too much?<br />On the plus side, the computer features 2x USB 3.0 ports and 1x USB 2. Despite this, I really wish there were 4 total USB ports. My previous laptop had 4 and I used them all.  I'm not deducting any stars for this. I'm nitpicking.<br />There is a SD card reader, inconveniently placed anterior and underneath the device. In practice you'll likely have to lift the laptop up just to see the slot. Placing it on the side seems more practical. Again I'm not deducting a star, it's nitpicking<br />The computer is sufficiently fast although it's not a gaming laptop.<br />Upon first boot, you'll notice Windows 7 prompting you to burn your own backup disc. While not entirely necessary (a backup partition has this data), it's still a prudent thing to do. I realize ASUS is probably saving money, but I'd really like an official Windows 7 installation disc. You'll need 4 blank DVD's to accomplish the backup.<br />Overall I'm satisfied with this budget-grade laptop. It does everything I need it to, despite some questionable design choices and weak screen.

Now complete the following example-
input: This is my first tablet, so I wasn't really sure what size to get.  I went with the largest one I thought was affordable.  As it turns out, this was more than enough for my 22\\"" wide screen monitor(1680x1050 res).  It could easily handle two of my monitors(unless, you're a fan of using really large brush strokes).  When you consider the ability to zoom in and out on your work, it becomes obvious that you can get away with having a much smaller tablet.  Personally, I consider my brush strokes to be about average(though a bit heavy handed, apparently) and I probably only use about roughly 1/4th of my tablet surface at a time when drawing/painting due to zooming in and dragging the image around.  Anyone who's used a laptop touch pad can easily see how little space is needed to mouse around.  In other words, if you don't plan to do any real drawing or painting, you can get away with the smallest tablet you can find.  People who simply want to ditch their mouse can go with a Bamboo but anyone planning to do any type of photo editing or graphic work should stick to the Intuos(for the accuracy).  With all that said, I can easily shrink my tablet in the settings if I wanted to just use part of it instead of the whole thing.  However, I am getting used to taking advantage of the extra space.    It did take me a while to adjust to using the tablet.  I've been using a mouse and keyboard for over a decade.  I didn't really think about the fact I hadn't written or drawn much of anything with a real pen or pencil for so long would cause such a learning curve but it did.  However, I did adjust after about a week of use(I expected it to only take one or two afternoons since I normally adapt quickly).  I have to say, for drawing or working on photos, this is a lot easier.  I still prefer my mouse for everything else though.  This is partially because I can't fit both the tablet and my keyboard on the desk at the same time(I usually hold the tablet in my lap when I use it).    I don'tuse the Express Keys that much but after a little customizing and getting used to it, I'm finding them to be faster than relying on my keyboard.  I figure that with time I'll use my keyboard less and less.  I also spend less time clicking tool buttons and more efficiently spend my time just using express keys.  Being able to switch tools by simply pressing an Express Key really saves a lot of time.  Though, I wish I could find a way to resize the eraser without selecting it first.  From what I've seen of the previous generation Express Keys, I don't see all that much of an advantage to the new ones.  The improvement is nice but seemingly unnecessary.    My actual drawing skill is not that great, yet, so I don't get much use out of the pressure sensitivity.  Instead, I manually control the opacity.  I figure that as my skills develop, I will probably learn to take advantage of the pressure sensitivity.  I'm just not there yet.  That said, even if I'm not using the pressure sensitivity, it's still a lot easier to draw with the tablet than a mouse.  Since I've never tried the Intuos 3, I can't really compare the sensitivity.    I've noticed that the nibs seem to wear down fairly fast.  Also, I hear the surface sheets don't last very long either compared to the previous generation.  I don't know if this was intentional to increase sales of replacement parts or a sacrifice to gain something else.  It does make the Intuos 3 seem more desirable in that sense.    Probably my biggest complaint with the whole thing is the pen itself.  It's just too fat for me.  It makes me feel like I'm using one of those fat pencils from Kindergarten.  I've more or less adjusted to it but I'll probably end up buying that slimmer version that doesn't have the rubber grip.    Ultimately, if I had it to do all over again, I'm not sure whether I'd get a smaller tablet.  I could very easily be happier with a smaller tablet, if for no other reason than being able to fit it on my desk.  However, the extra tablet space makes a dual monitor setup more comfortable.  I normally find the extra screen space unnecessary but when drawing/painting, there's a certain amount of advantage to being able to focus one monitor on just the painting and put everything else aside to the other monitor.  I could have saved money by getting an Intuos 3 but Wacom doesn't really seem to be supporting them anymore.  The advantages of the Intuos 4 over the Intuos 3 just don't seem necessary, this is especially true in the case of someone, like me, who doesn't take full advantage of the pressure sensitivity.

input: I love my Kindles and when I got the new Voyage as a Christmas gift, I was so excited.  I love the features, the back light, the responsiveness of the machine.  However, I have 1 issue with the battery life.  It doesn't last weeks like I saw it advertised, which is why I only gave 4 stars.  I have the lighting automatic, wifi off (plane mode), I shut it down every night, and I read, on average, 1-2 hours each night.  So I may not get weeks, but more than 5 days would have been nice.

I have tried several speakers and these seem to have the best balance between base and treeble.  I also like the fact that you can turn up or down the volume not on from your tablet but also from the speakers themselves.  Very nice size as they are small and mobile with a good length to the cords.  Having their own power source is wonderful so it doesn't drain your battery.  I have been using them with my HP Slate and hubby tried them with his MP3 player and they worked fantastic with both.  Have yet to try them with my phone as I'm not wanting to disconnect from my tablet.  Perfect as I would expect from Logitech.

input: Though I'm old school, and like a physical book for studying my teaching subject or for reading the Bible, this gizmo is pretty handy for a great many reasons.  The most outstanding is that I can download a new book title (assuming that it is offered by Amazon in Kindle format) in just a few seconds...wirelessly!!  The book will be in my Kindle literally (using the word correctly) before I can log out of Amazon and back into my e-mail.  A second quality is that it is easy to transport just about anywhere and the battery lasts quite a while...you know how many times you have to sit and wait for the doctor,  in the airport, or while your wife is shopping...in 3 or 4 seconds after hitting the on button you're reading from the page where you left off.  I'm sold on the thing.

Another thing I have noticed, when I shut it down while I was reading a book, it does not bring you back to where you were. Again no instructions. so I have to scroll back over half the book. is it suppose to do that? How do you just delete a book after you are thru reading it?

input: I was looking for a replacement for my old Belkin Nostromo n52te and stumbled upon this seemingly awesome device. I'd always been a huge fan of logitech products and the G13 looked like the perfect keypad for me.<br /><br />I'm a professional designer and use a keypad for all my hotkeys in Photoshop. Depending on the freelance job, I have to move around and jump onto different computers. That's why I really loved having the onboard memory on the n52te. Program your macros and you can plug it into any computer and away you go! I was *specifically* looking for a keypad with onboard profile storage which is why I picked the G13.<br /><br />Unfortunately I was totally mislead...This is the information on the amazon page:<br /><br />&#34;Onboard Memory<br />A handy solution for the laptop gamer, the G13 gameboard includes onboard memory, letting you program up to five ready-to-play profiles and take them with you to your next LAN party. The G13 gameboard also offers pre-configured settings for many popular games, including World of Warcraft: Burning Crusade, Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, and many others.&#34;<br /><br />Nowhere does it say that you need the LGS software to run any of the profiles. It only mentions it when describing how to program your keys.<br /><br />I do have to admit though, everything else on the keypad works flawlessly. The software is very useful and the hardware is up to logitech standards. I just can't believe they advertised this as a portable keypad when you need to install the Logitech Gaming Software to even run it. The worst part is that there are other logitech products such as the G series gaming mice that DO have the ability to use the set profiles without a driver. Makes me really wonder: why was the G13 omitted this awesome feature?
output: ",Disappointing. Not portable as advertised...Profiles do not work without LGS software.

input: I bought this router along with the companion Medialink Wireless N USB Adapter in the hopes of moving from wireless 802.11 g speed up to at least a slow Wireless N speed. The router and adapter did work, but I could never get a better speed than the standard wireless G speed of 54 Mbps--which I was already getting with my old wireless G router.<br /><br />I called support and was taken back through my setup, which was ok, but the support person had no further suggestions at that point.<br /><br />I'm returning the router and adapter and buying the Cisco E3200 instead.
output: ",Speed wouldn't exceed 54 Mbps

The same thing happened to a second box with a different tech support person.  Do yourself a favor.  Don't buy this box.<br />BTW, I am a system administrator for a large university.

Now complete the following example-
input: On first release these cards were $400.  But now since their price drop I was more easily able to justify the cost, that being said since owning the card I would have happily paid 400 for it.  I had a dual tuner card prior to this for just OTA/ClearQAM cable, and I was always re configuring, tweaking, and adjusting the thing.  Very frustrating, and the wife was not too happy with the situation either.  I was absolutely shocked at how easy it was to set up the Ceton InfiniTV4.  A few things:<br /><br />First - I have Comcast, dont let them charge you to swap out your current equipment, or have a tech come out to do a \\""professional\\"" install.  Go to the store PHYSICALLY and get your cable card.  This saves you 50 bucks.<br />Second - MAKE SURE, you upgrade the devices drivers AND FIRMWARE before trying to configure it.  I didn't update the firmware and couldn't get the card to work until I did so.<br />Third - There may be some signal quality issues that weren't previously noticeable with your old receiver box.  In my case the comcast tech had to run a whole new length of cable from my house to the node.<br /><br />After all that - this card is everything I hoped and dreamed my HTPC would be initially.  I also have an xbox that is set up as a media center extender, and I can stream live or recorded TV to that as well (ie. can watch two different channels at the same time on both my HTPC and Xbox).<br /><br />The only issue I've had is that occasionally I get the message \\""No tuners available\\"" or \\""All tuners in use\\"" in WMC when trying to stream TV.  A reboot of my machine fixes this every time, but it hasn't been enough of a nuisance to warrant much troubleshooting yet.

input: I purchased this computer because my thinkpad T61's screen had become dim after 18 months of use. I did all kinds of searches for about 1 week then finally bought the Toshiba P505D.    The computer has a large screen with pretty good brightness, Toshiba describes it as \\""True Bright\\"", I think it's bright, but not \\""very\\"" bright, it probably is around 200nit-250nit, but it won't give you \\""stunning\\"" visual experience. Anyway, it's a lot more comfortable to staring the screen for 2hours than the old Thinkpad T61's.     The sound card of this computer is terrible,if you listen to FLAC through the audio jack using a headphone like the Sennheiser HD 280 pro, you would find a lot of mids in the music are lost, and of crouse, many details are lost as well, if I have to use headphones on this computer I would use a USB soundcard instead.    The speaker is very loud, and contains a lot of distorted bass, I think there is a 6dB boost in the 60HZ to 100 HZ range, I don't quite mind the distortion though, because it's not very possible to find a speaker as loud as this in a 15.4\\"" or 14.1\\"" model from any manufacture in the market.    And the performance, the P505D is noticeable slower than my Thinkpad T61(2.0GHZ T7300, 3GB RAM, 100GB

I plugged this router in, installed the software and the router figured out the DLS configuration up to and including my login and password.<br /><br />Now I've been using routers for many years, I work from home using VPN, this is the easiest router to configure I've ever seen.  I live in a 3 story house, the router is in the lowest floor.  We get good signal on the upper floors and have no problems watching Netflix.  plus everything about the router is in your tray simply right click the icon and you're in and able to config, browse or look at the logs.<br /><br />the router has been plugs in for over 2 weeks now and hasn't lost connection once.  I have an extra 250G personal drive I should plug into the USB port for family photo sharing.  I haven't used that feature yet.<br /><br />as far as I can tell this router gets a 5 star.

input: I was nervous putting it on my iPad myself but I decided to try it this morning. I read all of the instructions & was relieved when I saw the lifetime warranty - they'll send you a new one if you mess up putting it on or if you scratch it later and need a new one!! So I relaxed and put mine on using the hinge method described on their instruction sheet (they give you two installation options) and it worked perfectly!! No bubbles, no dust - looks great. I did use a can of air after wiping mine down with the cloth they provided, and it was very helpful.
output: ",This is awesome!!

input: I used this caddy to put an extra hard drive in my Dell Latitude 6520. It works great -- I mounted the drive, inserted the caddy, and instantly had SATA access to my drive. It has embedded set screws that mount into the hard drive to keep it securely in place.<br /><br />A couple minor cons:<br />(1) There is NO BEZEL on the outside of the unit to make it form up with the curved outside of the laptop. This doesn't really bother me, but it might annoy most people.<br /><br />(2) There is no handle or mechanism to hold the caddy in the laptop chassis similar to the push-to-eject handle on the DVD unit. This means (a) you will not be able to pull the drive caddy out, and (b) there's nothing stopping it from falling out if you give the laptop a good jolt while it was vertical. I solved this problem by dismounting the push-to-eject handle from the DVD unit and attaching it to the new caddy. This has a locking mechanism in it to keep the hard drive locked in and allows me to pull it out. It also leaves the DVD with a small gap that I can grab with my finger to pull the drive out. Problem solved.
output: ","Good, inexpensive way to add second hard drive to Dell Latitude E6520"

Now complete the following example-
input: I purchased this case for my iPad 4th generation after going through the myriad options on Amazon. I received it today, and have to say it is quite nice. The materials are good, and the build quality appears to be a notch about many of the cheap products I've seen.<br /><br />The problem is, it just doesn't fit right. The case appears to be just ever so slightly too narrow. With the iPad fully inserted, the far left edge hangs a bit off the edge into the spine. This causes the top cover not to line up properly. This in turn causes problems with the clips on the cop and bottom of the case that are meant to clip onto the iPad and hold the cover in place. The bottom clip will snap in eastily, but the top clip absolutely will not snap into place unless you forcibly bend and contort it into place.<br /><br />I've contacted Marware support about the issue, and hope to hear back soon. I'll update when I do, but, for now, I would avoid this case if you have a 4th generation iPad.<br /><br />Update 12/12/12: I did get a response from Marware. They claimed that my issue wasn't a known problem, but agreed to send out a new cover.<br /><br />In the interim, I noticed that my existing cover was beginning to loosen up a bit. After a few days, the pressure needed to close the case had diminished greatly. I did finally receive the replacement, and it does seem to fit marginally better than my original did out of the box. Unfortunately, the replacement has other build issues that the first did not. The replacement has a great deal of extra material sticking out around the stitching. It makes the cover feel very poorly built. In the end I decided to keep my original cover. The stitching on it is much cleaner, and it has loosened up enough that I don't have issues opening and closing it now as I did initially.<br /><br />I will say that I do like the case. It is light, looks good,  and provides very good protection. It's unfortunate that build quality does seem to be a bit of an issue. I'm raising my initial 2 star review to a 3 star, which is probably more like 3.5 stars. The truth is, even with the Marware case's flaws, I've not found an iPad case that I like any better.

This Adonit case with keyboard has made it all easier. I am very happy with my purchase. Learning to type has taken a little practice but I was warned from other reviews. It is somewhat small for large hands. A design improvement would be to make the keyboard normal size and then design the case around that. Just a little longer would not be uncomfortable to carry around. And it would make typing a breeze.   In spite of that, I recommend this for those looking to avoid the hunt and peck one finger typing on the integrated iPad keyboard.

Now complete the following example-
input: The Lenovo IdeaCentre Q190 meets my requirement. It's slow, compared to what I'm used to, but not any slower than most mainstream mid-level laptops. I'm using it exclusively as an HTPC, hooked up to a Pioneer A/V receiver and an old 60\\"" LG plasma TV. It plays all audio and video files I tried (of course, this depends on the software used). 4K videos works well on my monitor but the TV can't handle it reliably (TV is not 4K). Noise is a non-issue. The VESA mount works well for hiding it behind the monitor/TV. From my router in the living room at the rear of the house to my home office at the front is 55 feet and I'm getting 5-bar WIFI signal strength. If your expectation is realistic, it should work well for you. It's a good HTPC or secondary desktop PC.<br /><br />One serious Issue:<br /><br />At first I could not update to Windows 8.1. It got stuck on downloading loops with each loop lasted about one hour, then it started over without actually downloading anything. I tried several times on different days with the same result, so I decided to forget about it. Then a week later it updated to Windows 8.1 automatically.  However, after the update LAN ports and WLAN were dead. Lenovo tech support did not help at all. Since Windows troubleshooting indicated it was having problems with the drivers, I went to Lenovo web site and downloaded the Windows 8.1 LAN and WLAN driver files and installed. Still didn't work. I decided to start clean and uninstalled the drivers, downloaded the Windows 8.0 files and installed. To my delight, LAN and WIFI worked with 8.0 driver files. Out of curiosity, I installed 8.1 files again. And yes LAN and WIFI were dead again!  Finally, I uninstalled and reinstalled 8.0 files and left it at that. Bottom line: DO NOT use the Windows 8.1 driver files; you need the 8.0 files.<br /><br />Comments:<br /><br />I don't like or care for included funky remote. I'm using the Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 800 and mouse combo, which works very well from a distance of 12 feet. It still works at 14 feet but becomes a little jumpy.<br /><br />It becomes warm to the touch after running for a while. Exhaust feels hot but it's nothing to be alarmed. Again, it's not any worst than some laptops. It needs air circulation, so it's definitely not a good idea to wedge it between books on your bookshelf.

input: I've had my KlearKase for Kindle 3 for a few days now and I'm pretty close to completely satisfied.  For protection I think it's great (haven't tested it, but it feels pretty solid and safe).  For weight, it's good.  Yes, it nearly doubles the weight of the kindle package, but that's still pretty light. For ease of using the Kindle while in the case it's excellent.  All the controls are quite reachable and audio books are still quite audible, though perhaps the sound is a little blurred.  I haven't tested the splashproofness, but I think I'd be confident to read in the bath with the KlearKase on.<br /><br />My gripes with it are all small things.  The biggest would be that it's far more reflective than the kindle screen.  Considering the non-reflectivity is a major advantage of the kindle, this is the big thing that makes me less inclined to keep the kindle in the KlearKase all the time.  That said, it's see-through enough that it doesn't detract from visibility any more than reading a book through a glass window does.  The other three small disadvantages are a) I think the surface might scratch quite easily, eventually resulting in a less clear viewing, b) you need a quarter (or a 10c piece if you're Australian) to be able to open the case and take the kindle out, which can be a bit tedious, and c) the silicone sections pick up dust and hairs really easily, which means I had to put in-take out-put in-take out-put in just to get the inner side of the silicone parts hair-free (I have a fluffy cat at home).<br /><br />Overall, it's like Mary Poppins - \\""practically perfect in every way\\"" :-)

input: I was having wrist problems at work so I decided to get some ergonomic gear. I didn't notice too much of a difference at first, but after using a regular mouse at school, I could really notice the strain on my forearm.<br /><br />My only complaint about this mouse is that the middle mouse click is kind of difficult to press. Since you can't program the buttons, I just downloaded a program that could, and switched the middle mouse click to one of the buttons on the side. Much better!<br /><br />For the price, this product is just what I needed.

input: If your plan is to buy this card, attach it to a laptop, and then attach it to a GoFlex USB 3 Hard Drive, prepared to be disappointed.  This card does not provide enough power on its own to run USB hard drives.  Although it comes with a cord that allows for additional power to be provided to the card from a spare USB port on your laptop, something about the power output causes the drive to simply stop working after a while.  I initially thought it was my supplemental USB port turning off power, so I tried an external power source that I knew would not turn off and had the same result.  Tested the same drive using USB 2.0 directly, and no issues.<br /><br />This appears to be an OEM card that has multiple brands, and is based on the Renesas USB chip, so I suspect any of the cards that look exactly like this one and use the same driver will have the same result.  Works for probably 5-10 minutes, then stops.  Very disappointing.

input: I purchased this item to clear space on my desk and get the monitor to the correct height and there is great value in this adjustable stand.  You are given 16 blocks (4 blocks per corner) that are each 1&#34; in height. I currently only use two blocks in each corner to prop up the monitor 2&#34; off of my desk, but have the ability to go higher if I would like. It allows me to perfectly fit notepads, staplers, etc. underneath the stand. My only criticism is that the stand is about 16.5&#34; wide between the legs, and my keyboard is 17.5&#34; wide, so I have to angle the keyboard in order to store it underneath the stand as it does not slide directly underneath. However, I have a keyboard with the 10 key numberpad, so if you just have a small keyboard it would be perfect. Overall, really good value here in my opinion.

Now complete the following example-
input: Rather than put off purchasing a tablet until she had saved enough for a more reputable brand, my ten-year-old decided to take a chance on this budget device. She is sorry she did.<br /><br />The display was inferior, but it was good enough for the price, and she was happily using it for games and pictures. (The camera is front facing ONLY.) But during the first day of normal use (I was there--she was not rough on it), the power and volume buttons on the side of the device no longer sprang back when depressed, making them unusable. She was disappointed but decided to live with it since the device could still be turned on by plugging it in, and since there was a volume control on the screen as well. But by day three, the tablet would no longer power on at all.<br /><br />The seller offered to exchange the device, but we had no confidence that a new one would last. In the end, my daughter was able to get a full refund, so she was only out the cost of shipping. But the whole experience has put her off the idea of owning a tablet at all.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this device. You have been warned.
output: ",Don't say I didn't warn you.

input: Normally, when you buy a screen protector, they include a little plastic squeegee thing to help you push out all the bubbles.  You don't need it with this screen protector. They DO provide you with two cleaning cloths (a wet and a dry one) to prepare your screen before you put on the film.<br /><br />After I cleaned the screen, it was amazing that the film just went on smoothly with absolutely NO bubbles.  It took a few seconds to apply the film and I was done!  What a difference from the time I've spent pushing bubbles with other films; and no cursing!<br /><br />I am so pleased with the product.  It is virtually finger print proof, unless your fingers are a dirty. But they provide a lint free cleaning cloth for that! The film also cuts down the glare quite a bit.  It is hard to see any loss of clarity of the display between when the film is applied and with no film.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product!
output: ",Wow - When they say no bubbles...

Now complete the following example-
input: My neighborhood is full of WiFi networks. Some of my neighbors' routers jump from channel to channel, causing intermittent interference.<br /><br />I have a lot of devices in my house. Any device that is relatively stationary (printer, Z-wave controller, PC, IP camera) is plugged into one of these little gems, as they are immune to WiFi interference. Set up is easy. Just follow the directions. I have found that they will not work if plugged into surge suppressors (the instructions said so, but I had to try) or z-wave controlled outlets (these create interference).<br /><br />The only reason I don't give these adapters five stars is that they have to be unplugged and replugged periodically (monthly, quarterly?) to keep the network up and running. That's my first shot at troubleshooting if a Powerline AV connected device loses network connectivity. Start by unplugging the one connected to your router, then go around and unplug/replug the 'client' adapters.
output: ",In a world gone mad with WiFi signals...

Now complete the following example-
input: This is a nice little controller.  I mainly use it to play NBA 2K15 on my PC and it works good.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it has a very weird shape.  I have relatively large hands, so it's not too much of a problem, but I can see people with short or stubby hands having trouble pressing the triggers.<br /><br />Pros:<br />X-Input/Direct-Input switch in back.<br />Good Buttons.<br />Solid Analog sticks.  Feels like they will last a while.<br />Great Value.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not ergonomically designed.  The shape of this thing is weird.  I'm sure it will get easier to hold over time, but it just feels weird.  They should definitely consider changing the shape and this will be perfect.

Just go from cable to modem to PC then call the tech and give him the MAC address that you have already copied off the bottom of the modem. Took 5 minutes. Barry-O could do it.

Now complete the following example-
input: I initially purchased this monitor for an attorney who needed a second portrait-oriented monitor for drafting documents that would put most of us to sleep. Because it was intended to match the right hand (second) monitor it needed to be 20\\"" and due to the Ergotron mount, it needed to be light.<br /><br />Before purchasing this monitor, please note that there are no VESA mounts on the back. You must use the stand that comes with it and that stand elevates the screen just under three inches. This is going to be a very important consideration for a lot of people.<br /><br />As a monitor, the unit performs as expected. Color reproduction runs a little heavy into the blue spectrum and will need to be calibrated if you are a graphic designer... wait hang on. Why are you looking at a 20\\"" screen, designer? Moving on. The back light isn't especially bright and the menu has four default settings (movie, photo, gaming, text) in addition to \\""custom\\"". After a couple of hours, I'm finding the monitor a bit hard to look at due to the fact the anti-aliasing on fonts looks terrible. At this point, I've further reduced the brightness to level 25/100 to deal with it.<br /><br />Finally, the power cable is non-standard. If your power conversion box goes, you'll have to buy a new one. While it's not likely to happen, it does represent an extra part to lose or break. On the other hand, if you haven't lost or broken the charger attachment for your phone, printer, tablet, or... well you get the idea. People who take good care of their things will probably be fine. People who don't may not want the extra part attached.<br /><br />In short, the monitor that came with this Gateway vastly out-performs the HP monitor that arrived at the office this morning.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Price is right<br />+ Slim, light,<br />+ Shiny finish, modern looking case<br />+ Energy efficient<br /><br />Cons:<br />+ Limited brightness & color adjustment<br />+ No mounting bracket<br />+ Very short non-adjustable stand<br />+ Non-standard power input<br />+ Shiny surface will scratch easily<br />+ Not as bright as expected from an LED screen<br />+ Gamma is heavily blue, even in warm light mode (cheap LED backlight)<br />+ Poor anti-aliasing, especially on fonts. Edges look chunky.
output: ","Half-way decent budget monitor, lots of limitations"

input: I have been on the search for the perfect stylus. As many have stated, until Apple makes it a part of the IOS, most of the software is a work around. I have always enjoyed the Waccom stylus; because of the rubber tip . My issue with the Waccom has been the thicker tip. I have the Jot Script, however I found the tip can skip at times.<br /><br />The Joy Factory is the best of both worlds, a rubber tip stylus that is thin. It does come with it's issues as well.<br /><br />The actual pen is thicker than most stylus , which can be a tad cumbersome. The tio is a captive tip controlled by a battery. The battery is a AAAA, which is available at any Walgreens or CVS. The problem is that the pen sucks the battery power. I have had the own for 3 weeks and I have gone through 4 batteries. I found that I have to unscrew the top , to preserve battery power.<br /><br />With all that said, for the price it is a decent stylus .
output: ",Decent stylus for the price .

input: Still a good travel charger. Don't know why it's only $32. But that's fine! We bought two extra because my boss loses stuff like this. One drawback is that there is no tip for our newest Lenovo laptop E440. I hope they make one soon!<br />The other drawback is that the charger takes up room when plugging into a power strip.

Now complete the following example-
input: For about twenty years, all I used were gel pads for my keyboard and mouse. I upgraded to different types throughout the years and never thought I’d change until my last one popped and gel started oozing out. Who knows how long it oozed for before I noticed. All I know is that one day, the keyboard pad felt flatter and I saw this sticky, clear gel all over my desk.<br /><br />Not only did it take me several hours to remove the gel from the desk, my keyboard was also ruined and had to be thrown out.<br /><br />Time to try something new. I bought this keyboard pillow pad and it’s been great. It turns out that I like the way the pillow feels better than the gel anyway! It’s comfortable, supportive, and feels very durable. My only wish is that the pad would spread all the way across instead of having two different pads since there’s a gap that I notice all the time. Never going back to gels again!
output: ",So much better than gel pads

input: This works with Time Warner Cable and easy to set up.  Simply call your cable provider so they can authorize the signal to the modem.  For some reason I thought this was a combo modem/router when I initially purchased this. (Maybe bezuase it was late, I was sleepy and I did not fully read the descrition, but it is not),  After receiveing the modem I quikly reliazed my error and purchased the &#34;TP-LINK TL-WR841N Wireless Router&#34; I have had these for about 2 months now and they are working perfectly...  I was able to return the unit I was leasing and can save 15 dollars a month. Or increase my internet speed... We'll see...

input: Not much needs to be said about computer RAM specifically for laptops, but I can say that the upgrade was quick, easy, and painless.<br />Simply release the retaining latches on each side of the old RAM module, gently remove the (being sure to avoid any static discharges, of course) old module, then insert this new RAM module, gently seating it until the latches click fully into place.<br />Turn the computer on, and just like that, my laptop goes from 4GB to 8GB of RAM.<br />Everything works perfectly, and the computer's performance is improved dramatically.<br />One note to anyone using a 32-bit OS, such as all Windows XP editions except for &#34;Professional X64&#34; or &#34;Itanium,&#34; will not benefit from this upgrade, since the maximum amount of RAM those can address is 3.2GB or 4GB of installed RAM.<br />This is not just a Microsoft limitation, but inherent to all 32-bit operating systems, including older version from Apple and even 32-bit Linux and other Unix-like systems.<br />Once you upgrade to a proper 64-bit OS (Windows 7, Windows 8.x, 64-bit Linux, etc.), you will be able to use well beyond 8GB of RAM.<br />Does your motherboard have room for nearly 17 billion gigabytes of RAM?<br />No, I'm not joking with that last sentence.

Now complete the following example-
input: The Kindle 2, like the K1 before it, is a great product for the heavy recreational reader.  Unfortunately, many of the changes made in design aren't necessarily better, just different.    The increase in screen resolution is a very welcome change.  Simple diagrams that were illegible on the K1 are just fine on the K2.  As I'm finding though, progress on the Kindles does not come without some negative, in this case the screen contrast on the K2 seems a little lower then on the K1.  Also, I think they got that page turning speed up by hobbling the screen refresh: when taking the K2 out of sleep, ghosting from whatever picture was on the splash is clearly visible and doesn't go away until doing an <alt-g>.    The buttons.  We've all heard more then we care to about the buttons.  Again, I have to go back to the two steps forward one step back kindle design.  Yes, the big, easy press buttons on the K1 could be a pain and the inward pressing buttons were a great solution to the perceived problem.  Unfortunately, they went too far by making the edge buttons so much smaller.  Long reading sessions can now become uncomfortable for those with large hands as you tend to place your thumb either right on or next to the next page button (basically, holding the Kindle by its very edge).  This certainly cramps my thumb up.    The memory and battery changes are a mixed bag I guess; I'm not a fan of the changes but certainly don't consider them deal breakers, either.  The first charge on my K2 was no better than the K1 though that seems to have improved with use.    One last point that's more a publisher gripe then Amazon gripe is the tendency to offer ebooks based on trade paperbacks, pricing them at $9.99 and still claiming a discount.  If a book's been out for a few years, there's no reason for the ebook to cost $9.99.  Reevaluating that policy would be good for everyone involved.    Overall I'd call the K2 a good purchase but as an upgrade to the K1, not so much.  If you think aK2's right for you, it probably is.  Whispernet alone puts the Kindle beyond all other readers (if you're in a coverage area).
output: ","Good for a new adopter but for the Kindle 1 owner, not so much"

I had purchased a USB adapter that was supposed to have a \\""power boost\\"" that increased the signal strength, but if it helped at all it wasn't enough to notice.<br />I received this new adapter just a few days after ordering.  It included a mini-CD and instructions on how to set up and access the driver for the adapter. The print on the instructions was very small and it didn't explain that you need to look at the numbers on the CD sleeve to know which driver to choose when the menu came up. These are the only complaints that I have!  The driver loaded swiftly, I attached the antenna to the adapter(it simply screws on), plugged it into my USB port, and was online in no time.  The connection is now full strength!<br />I am very pleased with this inexpensive and easy solution to a serious problem (after all, I didn't want her hogging MY computer).

Now complete the following example-
input: Amazon got everything right with the Kindle 3. The ability for my library to sync across all my reading devices makes it easy to start reading at home, and pick it up on my phone later at the office or on a computer or elsewhere. I feel like my entire collection is just a moment away no matter where I am! With this edition the load times have become trivial and the price more-than reasonable. I picked up the white 3g+wireless because I do a lot of traveling, and I can attest that the 3g works great over-seas for getting my Amazon.com fix. I downloaded over 100 free out-of-copy-write titles the day I got my Kindle - amazing works of literature for free! My only complaint is that more titles aren't available as Kindle editions, but I feel this is more a sign of the times and not any reflection on Amazon - I suspect Nook and other comparable e-readers have similar availability limitations. The Amazon site allows you to request publishers make certain titles available on Kindle, so they obviously recognize this limitation on the e-reader market. Hopefully most publishers will soon embrace the future. I know I for one have repurchased several titles I already owned just to have them on Kindle where I can have quick and easy access to them, so I'm confident the future will be rich with e-books!

[storage sharing]<br /><br />it also supports CloudShare but for android you need to pay like $2 , which is dumb couldnt they just include that $2 int he price and dont bother make you buy an app for each tablet or phone?<br /><br />I would say for this price the rouer is not bad at all but I went for something with less featuer and more quality ( I chose Asus N300 (which supports two USB sotrage at higher speed)

input: Headset didn't work after 5 or so minutes of use. this is not a software problem as i was able to test it in multiple machines. it seems like the cable is either very sensitive or I was very unlucky on my purchase. The item just completely refused to work, even with the correct software installed. Only positive thing I have to say is that the item is at least comfortable and looks very nice.

I have never flattened or squeezed the cable, or distorted it in any way that may have damaged the inner wiring so I am not sure why it stopped working. There was nothing wrong with the HDMI cord inserted into the adapter because it still works fine with my ps3. When the Belkin adapter worked, it did exactly what it was supposed to do, but I will have to give it a 1 star rating for the materials used to make it. If it only lasts half a year like some of the generic brands, then I would recommend buying one of those for much less.

The shipping and handling cost more than the adapter, so I wasn't expecting top-notch equipment. However, I have purchased cheap adapters from amazon.com before and they at least lasted 6 months. I had to set this one aside once it started burning up, making strange noises, and even affecting the proper functioning of my laptop (it started to freeze whenever I plugged it up and refused to charge. weird!)  The shipping was quick. Again, you get what you pay for, but there are longer-lasting options elsewhere on this site.

input: I purchased two of these Hubs to use with my late 2013 MacPro. This MacPro has only 4 USB 3.0 ports. The Hubs are well-built and attractive. With peripherals plugged in, it manages to sit flat on its base. (Many other Hubs are unable to do this and lift the base from the surface on which it sits. I can make no comment about the power it supplies to each of its 10-Ports, or the speed of each Port because with this Hub plugged into my MacPro, it would not boot to the Desktop. No matter what combination of peripherals I plugged into the Hub, and even with NO peripherals plugged into this Hub and this Hub plugged into my MacPro, I could not boot to the Desktop. I am currently working with AuKey's Service Manager to see if AuKey can resolve my problem. If my problem is resolved, I will add to this review and tell you what worked.

Having a spare allows me to run the netbook at peak settings to speed things up, or extend the time I can use it when I'm away from a power source.<br /> I love having the extra battery available when I start to run low on power at an inconvenient time. I snap in the fresh battery when I need it and then put the dead one back in at night to charge it. In the morning I change back to the partially used one so I always have a fresh battery.<br /> This was worth every penny, and I feel like I got a great deal!

input: I hated this product at first and there are things that I am still not happy with. With my Ipad in it, it is heavier than i thought it should be. One of my keys got hung up once and I had to try to wiggle it back into place. the description makes it seem like you can just swirl it around with no issues, but that is wrong. It is kinda difficult to move it around and it slides out of place before settling in place (hard to describe). You cannot sit this on your lap & type. It has to be sitting on a table or something; otherwise, you cannot see the screen because it sits up straight. Lastly, you cannot use the up and down arrrows on the keyboard to scroll on pages... atleast I have not been able to. I love how  I can use caps lock, how I can unlock it on the keyboard, and how easy it is to catch on. Overall, I like the product I just wish it wasn't so heavy and not so difficult to move around.

input: So I ordered one for myself (white A13 Dragon Touch) and fell in love with it when it got to my house, I brought it to class after it was fully charged and during class, found out it can bug out sometimes, would take forever to load a certain page, if you are on a busy page on the web it would freeze and work again about 2 minutes later. Regardless of how it works, I still enjoy using it, playing games on it, and am planning on replacing this for my phone since there are apps you can download to use it exactly as a phone.<br /><br />On the same day I received it, I decided to order two more for my sisters' birthday (black A13 and Blue A13 Dragon touch). It got to my house two days later, but when I was trying to charge them, the slots were too loose or too small and the charger would not even go in. I thought it was the charger's fault but then I tried it on my white tablet and the chargers worked fine. I am in the process of returning them and getting a refund because 200 dollars for two broken tablets did not make me happy.<br /><br />After this incident, I PROBABLY won't order any more of these tablets because I will probably have the same problem again. But I do think it's worth the price if your tablet gets to your house and works and do recommend it to people who does not want to pay for an iPad or other expensive tablets. What I don't understand though, is why was the first one I ordered working but not the two that came after? Like everyone says, you get what you pay for.<br /><br />__________________________________________________________<br />UPDATE-<br /><br />I sucked up and decided to order another one. This time, the tablet came messed up again, but I kept it because even though the charger slot was too small, all I needed to do was plug in the keyboard cord and the holes were evened out. The tablets still works the same, kind of slow, freezes often, and used up all the 6gb that were available since the tablet came with installed apps. The battery life is horrible, lasts me 30 mins - 1 hour since I use the tablet often. -You get what you pay for.<br /><br />After two months, the laptop screens cracked, and when they cracked, they broke like taped plastic. Operates everything slow and your money will just go to waste. DO NOT BUY IT.

Now complete the following example-
input: I use this router at home and connect via the VPN to a SnapGear at the office.  The VPN took about 10 minutes to get setup and has not failed once since.  The main issue with setting up the VPN was finding a protocol that both the router and the SnapGear had in common.  The EnGenius router has several different protocols to choose from and not being a true network guru it took a few minutes to go through them.    On the local network I have a consistent 1 Gbps connection.  There is no lag when streaming from my computer to my PS3 or XBOX.  I also stream straight from the internet and have never had a problem.  I also learned that you need all 8 wires to get 1 Gbps.  I had split my cat 5 into 2 connections using 4 wires each and could not get 1 Gbps connections.  Once I \\""unsplit\\"" the connection it worked like a charm.  I was using a Linksys VPN router before and if I had the log file option turned on it would crash when hitting web sites like Amazon (google Amazon crash Linksys) and Fandango.  This router has no issue when any websites that I have found.    The wireless does work well.  I have the router in the basement and had an 80% signal when upstairs and 50-60 feet away.    I really only have had one issue with the router and that is the DNS relay.  After a reboot of the router I was not able to access the internet.  DHCP was assigning the router's IP as my DNS server but it was not working.  I set the router to assign a DNS server from my ISP and everything worked again.  The interface is different from other routers as well and takes a minute to find what you are looking for.  Also, when assigning a static IP via DHCP there is not a comment section only a MAC and IP field.  This isn't a big deal but it would be nice to have a comment field saying 00:00:00:00:00 192.168.1.50 Office, or something to that affect.  These are minor issues and nothing that I care greatly about.    Overall I do love this router it is exponentially better than routers that cost 2 or 3times as much.  Being an unknown brand, at least to me, I was a little concerned.  It has proven to be a great router and I'm very happy with it.  I would recommend this router for anyone needing a VPN router.

Now complete the following example-
input: Google has not fixed this tablet since its release ~about 6 months. Tablet is extremely buggy, tablets crashes, freezes up requiring hard reset, and the biggest issue MEMORY LEAK. The device pretty functions as if it has no RAM at all. Everytime you want to go home you have to wait at least 2 seconds, sometimes as long as 5-8 seconds and you can clearly see the homescreen has to reload the background and icons slowly because it doesn't exist in the RAM for quick reload. Also multitasking is impossible due to this as well. No matter how small the app, if you move to another app and try to go back, it will pretty much be very slow and/or reload the entire app as if it was force closed. Sometimes i come home to find the tablet completely frozen even though it hasnt been used. Expect to have to reset this tablet at minimum every other day to maintain a somewhat functional experience (if it didnt crash and needs a reset anyway)<br />Also the quality control on these units is very poor. Many units may or may not have light bleed on the screen (white light around the edges)<br />Every other nexus device has already received the latest updates, but all nexus 9 users have been shafted. Google sincerely owes all nexus 9 buyers some form of reimbursement.

I purchased this because of all the rave reviews, the simple set-up, and for the amazing image and sound quality. But, the image quality is shoddy, grainy, and often freezes. I cannot comment on the sound quality – because there were no audio cord attached to the device or in the package. I wasted my money on a product I cannot return because it was delayed in customs.

input: This case is and does everything that it claims it can.  The leather is what you'd expect for the price and the construction is excellant.  I use the stand feature on the dash of my truck to watch shows that I downloaded at home and have found it to be very sturdy. It doesn't flop around or fall. It does what its supposed to do.  The strap that holds it shut might be a problem down the line but after a month of use is still in great shape as is the rest of the cover.  In fact it protects my Fire so well I wasn't even worried on the two occasions that I dropped it.  Buy this for a little extra money and you won't regret it.  Also Amazon customer service is the best!  The USPS claims to have delivered my cover on Tuesday of Christmas week but I didn't get it.  I think they delivered it to my old address, but they denied it and were absoulutely no help, as you would expect.  Benjamin Franklin would be mortified if he knew what passes for customer service in his creation.  Amazon on the other hand apologized as if it were their fault and sent me another cover by UPS(maybe they should give USPS some pointers) and I had it on Thursday.  That's why I keep coming back to Amazon.

I don't have a max temp yet but will update once I stress the card. I did fool with the GPU tweak software Asus provided and changed the fan settings as they were a bit low for my liking (20% up to 60c before ramping up). A reminder to first time builders/upgraders, download the latest drivers from Nvidia's website and don't use the included disk as they are more than likely old. Great product, will update as I go.

input: This is the second of these hard drives I've purchased and I love them.  I've never had problems with Western Digital, and the one time I did have a hard drive crash, WD has an awesome RMA program and they replaced my 320gb with one of these 500gb.  I liked it so much, that I got a second one when I got a different macbook off of Craigslist.  They are a little noisy, but that's understandable with them being 7200rpm.  Great performance, and decent battery life.  Not as quick as an SSD of course, but for those of us who value storage capacity over speed, they're great.  Much faster than the 5400rpm drive that this macbook came with.  I'm waiting for ssds to come down in price before I upgrade to one of them again because they are just too spendy per gb.  I highly recommend this drive to anyone who wants a very reliable drive that is quick and has a 5 year warranty.

Now complete the following example-
input: I received my kindle as a birthday gift eight months ago and I love it, but I didn't always think that I would. Before I got the kindle I swore I would never get one because I saw it as an assault on my much loved paper books. The portability of this thing, the e-ink and the instant access to free books (more on that in a minute) really won me over though. Reading text on a regular screen makes my eyes tired and I usually just don't prefer to do it, but reading the kindle feels just like reading words on paper. And being able to carry the contents of huge books with me without the bulk of an actual book which may be 100's of pages long means I can find time to do a lot more reading.   That all being said, my kindle contains mostly free downloads and just a few books that were on the cheaper side. I'm not super fond of the idea that I could purchase an e-book (which sometimes is more expensive than an actual paper book) and then I'm limited with what I can do with it.  When I'm done with the book, why can't I give my digital copy away to someone else? If I can sell or give away my regular books why shouldn't I be able to do the same with my e-books? Just like if I can lend regular books to my friends and let them keep them for more than two weeks, why can we only lend out kindle books for two weeks? Some people are busy and two weeks isn't enough time.  Reading free books though has let me find some really good new authors who self-published. And being able to download books whenever I want is convenient for those instances where I find myself with some free time but the library isn't open, or just enough time that I'd like to read something but not enough time to get to the library even if it is open. I took my Kindle with me when I went on vacation to Europe and was able to use WiFi at the hostel to download the next book in a series so that I'd have something to read on a train ride. And again, being that the Kindle is so small bringing it with me on a trip whereI only had one small carry on sized suitcase and a backpack (for a two week trip) was not a problem.
output: ",Swore I'd never have an e-reader

Now complete the following example-
input: Santa left me a brand new Kindle under the tree and I've barely put it down since!    Being a voracious - some may say obsessive! - reader since I was just a young tot, I got used to making room for yet another bookcase as my collection continued to grow.  I'd been eying the Kindle and other ebook readers as they've entered the market over the last few years but held off on buying one; I wasn't sure that the reading experience could be comparable.    That all changed several months ago when I saw someone reading a Kindle at a restaurant.  She gladly gave me a brief 'demo,' and once I spent a couple minutes trying it out I knew that I'd sure like to have one of my own.  Come Christmas morning - there it was.  My very own Kindle!    It was simple to get started from zero, so to speak.  Within a few minutes I'd downloaded a book I'd been wanting to read, and very quickly I added a number of 'classics' and other public domain books.  My Kindle's been within arm's reach ever since.    The long battery life has been the biggest surprise; even with heavy use I've only had to charge it once so far.  Another surprise came as I read and read and read - the eInk screen has been much easier on my eyes than a paper book.  I'm not as young as I used to be, and in recent years I've been distressed to find myself with eyestrain after a couple hours of reading a paper book.  That just isn't happening on the Kindle and I couldn't be happier about it!      I'll never give up my paper books.  Some books just won't 'translate' quite as well to the Kindle - my cookbooks, for example, with their full color photos, are definitely paper book only material.  The Kindle renders black & white photos quite well, but I wouldn't want to use it to read/view any book that's richly illustrated.    For my everyday reading habits, however, I'm absolutely thrilled with the Kindle.

I can get to the charger, card slot, volume, power button and headphone jack just fine.  Both cameras worked just fine as well.<br />I got a credit-card look holder for my SD cards, and I did have to manipulate the card slot and stretch it out a bit to get it in the card slot, but after that it's been fine.<br />I am noticing a bit of wear around the power button, which seems odd for a leather piece less than a year old, but I also tend to be hard on things and that is a fiddly stitched area, not smooth leather.<br />I do wish there were hand straps for both portrait and landscape orientation, but that's not a deal breaker to me.<br />The stylus has an ink pen as well, I am trying to find a notepad that will fit into the credit card slot.<br />Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.

Now complete the following example-
input: This was a great laptop... for month. When I got it, the screen went black the second day of owning it for a couple of minutes. I touched the laptop gently and it went back to normal screen. I just brushed off the experience. 30 days later, the screen would go black a lot. I would had to push down on the laptop at that point to make it go back. I just assumed some wire inside the laptop was unattached or something. I'm good with computers, so I was just going to take it apart and fix it real quickly sometime in the future.<br /><br />At two months later, I finally opened it up because it turned black permanently. I couldn't get the screen to work anymore. When I inspected inside, there was nothing I could do. I couldn't find a reason the screen stopped working.<br /><br />Fast-forward to today. I own a Lenovo.
output: ",This was a great laptop.

Now complete the following example-
input: Purchased to upgrade an old Compaq laptop from 512M to 1Gig of RAM.  Wanted to upgrade a few old laptops so I can play around with various Linux distros without messing up my main computer.<br /><br />Seemed to work well from the start, but noticed a few odd behaviors.  Some Linux software seemed to work OK, others didn't even install correctly, though they should on a Pentium 4 with 1Gig of memory.  Ran Memtest 86 that came with a Ubuntu Distro disk, and found repeatable consistent failures at a specific memory location.  Swapped the two memory DIMMs around and got even more frequent consistent failures now at another memory location.  Put the original 512G of RAM back in and it's passing the same tests with zero issues.<br /><br />Went back to the Amazon site and requested to return this memory, which they agreed to immediately, printed the UPS return info, aranged for UPS pickup, and to refund the price.<br /><br />Disappointed this didn't work, but glad Amazon was so cool about the return. Will try to do this again, perhaps with another vendor.
output: ","Great price, but persistent RAM test failures.  Returning for credit."

It solved all problems previously mentioned and the HD is impressive while watching my recorded content from my Directv plus receiver. The low profile of the card was necessary for me because it was a tight fit getting it in between other cards. Also with no fan it's not noisy. I don't do any gaming so can't comment on that. I should mention that I use the Directv2pc Beta version. I have not looked at temperatures but I watched a full HD movies no problems.

Now complete the following example-
input: My poor desk!  I have 3 external hard drives (4 now) not to mention speakers and head phones and other usb gadgets all about.  In any case, I must say that this new My Book Elite is my new favorite of the hard drives at least.  Much like others like it, it is a separate memory bank from your computer or laptop so that should your pc fry, you can still have your files safely tucked away.<br /><br />As some of you know, your external hard drive can also fry, so it's good to have a backup of the backup (hence I have 4 laying about) but they're still very handy.  Unlike others, however, the My Book does a few other nifty things its competition can't.  For example, it comes with software that easily backs up your computer files without your having to hunt for you and even categorizes them by type (Pictures, music, movies, etc).  It also allows password protection which makes my privacy needs happy, and has a view screen that lets you know how much memory is remaining and a title if you wish.  For example, if you had 6 of these guys you could name one \\""Home Videos - 2001\\"" or something so you don't have to put masking tape on it or something as a label.  It also comes with a 3 year warranty which is much more than my other hard drives.<br /><br />Overall - External Hard Drives are kind of tricky.  They all run the risk of breaking and they all typically do the same thing.  I was more impressed with the My Book than others because of its extra goodies and extended warranty, but it also came in a cheaper container - plastic, instead of some which are rock-hard metal.  It's a little more expensive, too, but it also runs absolutely silent whereas some of the others are about as annoying as a snoring spouse.  Personally, as long as you don't expect the guy to undergo some kind of mega damage that might crack it's plastic coat, I think it's worth the few extra bucks to have the software and extra warranty.<br /><br />PS: If you are simply wondering whether or not you need an external hard drive - YOU DO.  With laptops that burn out all the time, you need a safer spot to store your precious memories and files.  I recommend this one more than any other, but if you don't like the look or whatever, still buy an external hard drive.  They make your computer run so much faster and makes everything so much cleaner and nicer.  They're like super massive usb drives!ve - YOU DO.

Now complete the following example-
input: I bought these for my two young children, who like to draw and write but not every environment is suitable for pens, pencils, markers, etc.<br /><br />Because the children are young, I was concerned about the loss of the stylus, so I searched out the add-on of the clip to hold the stylus, which also comes with additional (different shaped) magnets. The description does not state, nor did I see in the reviews I read, that the board comes with a clip to hold the stylus. No need for the add-on.<br /><br />The children have only had them for a day, but so far they are a great hit. They have enjoyed practicing their writing and drawing and I have noticed they have relaxed their grip already on their writing implement. I hope this will translate to a more relaxed grip and less frustration in writing in general.

Now complete the following example-
input: This model is about as simple as one can get. A box with a hard drive in it that stores<br />a multitude of docs, photos, recordings, or whatever you can digitize. One draw back<br />is that there is no backup software. You will have to drag and drop all your files initially<br />and subsequently whenever you update any of those files. Nothing is automatic.<br /><br />In the box is the hard drive, a USB 2.0 cable, a AC adapter power cable and set-up<br />instructions. This drive is designed to turn on and off with your computer as well.<br />Set-up is very simple with plug-and-play technology: plug in to power strip, plug the<br />USB cable into a receptacle on your computer. Your computer will recognize your external<br />hard drive and assign it a letter. You are all set to drag and drop your precious files.<br /><br />I have had this model for three years and If I had my druthers I would have spent the<br />extra money and gotten the WD hard drive with the automatic backup software. I<br />purchased one for a friend and set it up and it works like a dream. The only time it<br />took was to initialize the first backup onto the hard drive. After that it only adds what<br />it needs to do update the backup. Simple.<br /><br />Some people would say, why not use the backup software that comes with your Windows 7<br />operating system. I did. I don't like it. It was not as simple to set up and maintain as the<br />WD HD; and not as efficient.  Why? Because every time my Windows 7 backup program<br />backs up, it back up the whole computer hard drive, again. It is much simpler to buy<br />the external hard drive with the dedicated backup software.<br /><br />After 3 years I have had absolutely no problems with this passive Western Digital hard<br />drive. So I can absolutely recommend buying it, but with one caveat; get the model with<br />the back up software. Your life will be easier and more secure with auto back up. Believe<br />me you will be glad you did. I am going to purchase another one real soon and it will<br />have the software included.ng to purchase another one real soon and it will<br />have the software included.

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm a computer technician and I've had to deal with a plethora of issues concerning computer based blu-ray set-ups. I was very familiar with many of the common problems people deal with when setting up a blu-ray for their machine, but I felt that my technical skills would help me surpass these issues. I knew that the firmware would need to be updated and that window did not support blu-ray playback and thus I would have to use a 3rd party software to actually watch blu-rays. After reading a few of the other reviews I saw that this unit came with software and I figured that although I am not a fan of cyberlink software, I could deal with it if it would work. As it turns out my specific set-up does not work with the provided Cyberlink software and like many other reviewers I would need to purchase the latest Cyberlink DVD 12 software for eighty bucks. To hell with that i said and decided to do some research on freeware that would allow one to view blu-rays without having to pay for the software. After exhaustive research I was able to configure my computer with the aid of 4 different software 1 to enable to codec, 1 to play it, 1 to remove copy protection, and 1 to configure all of the micro settings between the various programs. When all is said and done the blu-ray's play but will skip and sometimes audio/video will de-sync. Now considering the number of solutions required to get the blu-ray to play its difficult to say if the problem is software or Hardware(my machine was top of the line 4 years ago so it might not be powerful enough to decode a 1080p image properly).<br /><br />To sum it up, the drive appears to be excellent. The problem is that it is more convenient to download video's from your favorite P2P site than it is to get a real blu-ray movie to play from your device.
output: ",More hassle than its worth...

Now complete the following example-
input: I bought one of these for my Kindle Fire and when considering a Nexus7 tablet, being able to find an Executive cover was a must.<br />The fit is great.<br />The quality of the real leather, not that knock off plastic stuff, makes the cover very professional looking and appropriate in just about any setting.<br />The dual zippers are large enough to grip easily but not overly large to look like a charm is attached. Zip action is smooth and easy.<br />Removing the sleeve that holds the Nexus7 inside the case takes a few tries of practice to get Velcroed back in just the right spot but for me being used to one for my Fire it didn't take but 2 tries to find the sweet spot<br />The added weight doesn't seem as much as it did with the the Fire but the Fire is already heavy for its size by today's standards. The extra girth, though noticeable, doesn't prevent the tablet in its cover from fitting comfortably in my cargo or Kaki pants pockets<br />All in all, another excellent product by rooCASE.

input: This may work fine for charging, but do not expect to power your device while listening to music. It introduces a loud clicking / whine into the audio. So I will have to stick to the Verizon car charger for my HTC Incredible. I connect my device to my stereos Aux-in port to listen to podcasts and streaming music like Pandora and this Belkin charger makes that impossible. If it did not cost 1/2 as much as I paid to return it, I would be sending it back.. The power circuitry in this has no filtering.

Now complete the following example-
input: I bought this flash drive within the same order that also contained a Silicon Power T06 flash drive of the same capacity.  As both were intended for use in my wife's car's audio system, the read speed is immaterial.  My primary factors included exposed profile height, apparent quality of construction, brand reputation, and warranty.  SanDisk's product warranty is notably shorter than Silicon Power's warranty.  I've had to use the warranty on a flash memory product TWICE (once with SanDisk, once with Transcend), so I am a believer in a good exercisable warranty program.<br /><br />When writing the same 34 mp3 test files totaling 312.63 MB to both drives, the Silicon Power flash drive completed the task in 72% of the time that this SanDisk required.  Okay, so this drive is a little slower during my unscientific test, but it really doesn't matter all that much to me.  Once the content is loaded I won't monkey with it for quite some time.<br /><br />Diminutive physical sizes of these flash drives can present some inconvenience when trying to remove them from a USB port, and I found that the SanDisk Cruzer Fit was more difficult to grasp than was the Silicon Power T06 flash drive.  I did not attach a lanyard to either drive, but I know that is a viable option to aid removal.

Now complete the following example-
input: Package arrived on time. Happy with the monitor. Been using it now for over a month now. Just the right size for my desk.<br /><br />The colors are fine for gaming but I did have to adjust brightness and contrast because the default setting was too dark for my liking.<br /><br />However I find that changing the volume on the monitor is tedious with having to go through the menus on the monitor every time I want to change it. Also there is a dead pixel (just one), that I find bearable but annoying, right in the middle area of the screen.<br /><br />Other than that I would say the monitor is awesome and would highly recommend it for hard like myself who play on 1080p maximum.
output: ",Happy with the monitor for the most part

The sound projects forward as advertised.<br />- The material of the case feels nice.<br />- I toss my iPad instead of gently placing it on hard surfaces because I know the case will protect it no problem.

input: I have had this for 8 days.  My first chrome experience was the LG Chromebase, which I love!  Bought that a month or so ago.  Was hooked.  Gave up my Windows laptop for this Chromebook.  I love it.  It is light, typing is great, normal... no issues with keyboard.  Feels high quality to me.  I don't quite like the exterior but I don't see it when I am working on the laptop.  My daughter thought that I had bought a Mac Book Air.   The screen is beautiful.  I guess the 1080 doesn't scale so there is tiny tiny font.  Was an adjustment after the BIG BEAUTIFUL screen on my Chromebase, but I am getting used to it.  I have read there are ways to increase the font but I haven't figured all of that out; it's legible though. I am good for now especially just zooming in.  Processing speed seems fine to me. I do everything on the net... banking, remote desktop to my work computer, email, you tube, etc. I am not a power user, so I never stream 10 things with 20 tabs open.  I might have 5 tabs max and maybe music, but rarely.  Works perfectly fine for my use.   Sound is nice.  Sounds better than the big LG Chromebase (but I still love the Chromebase.)  Has all the necessary ports.  Also it is LIGHT. My goodness.  My hubby just a bought an Windows 8 laptop that is beautiful (but heavy), but boy I can log on soooo much faster.  He hates when his laptop powers all the down.  This thing is quick!   Oh, it does get warm.  Not as bad as my old Windows Thinkpad, but it is certainly noticeable on my lap when I am wearing shorts. The warmth and the tiny font are why I am giving this 4 stars. It's not perfect.  But, it is good enough... certainly for the price!  My hubby's Windows 8 laptop cost more than 2x as much.  10/14/15 UPDATE.  Had this a year now.  Was great.  Loved it. But NO LONGER!!!!  Hate it.  The screen stopped working.  It see gray lines when I open it up.  Lasts for about 5 minutes, then it slowly fades to normal. I moved the few things off the hard drive that I had there incase I totally lose the screen which I expect to happen at any moment.  Also,  occasionally, the colors start to change, bright pink, fuzzy, shadows, etc.  It's annoying and weird.  I am currently searching for a new chrome laptop.  I see other reviews here with screen problems, so be careful.  I bought mine right after they came out so I could not have known about the screen issue.  Now YOU know. DO NOT BUY IT.  Getting only one year of use out of it is unacceptable.
output: ",SCREEN WENT BAD AFTER ONE YEAR. DO NOT BUY IT!!!

input: Love this case. It's just as pictured -- crisp, clean and fun. It's great to have something that looks a bit different. It holds the iPad mini 3 very well, a perfect fit. All buttons and ports are easily accessible, with perfect cutouts for speakers. I was a bit nervous about purchasing, as the description didn't explicitly state it would work for the mini 3, but I researched the specs, saw they were exactly the same, and took a chance. So glad I did. It's a beautiful case, mostly white on the front but easily cleaned with a damp cloth, and a cool black on the back. The back cover many pick up some lint depending on where it's placed but that's easily remedied with a quick swipe of a damp cloth. Overall a great inexpensive option. I had the red and white Paris cover for my previous ipad gen 3 and loved it as well. I can't speak to how well it protects the iPad from a fall as it's never fallen, but it's a good sturdy cover that completely covers the ipad and all corners and closes securely with the magnets. I also don't use it too much as a stand, but it works well for when I need to use it as one. Very happy with this case!

input: Excellent cooler does a great job. This is an obvious performance cooler, cause I have a FX 9590 under it and I typically idle around 25 to 35 celsius. When stress testing the cpu (Loadtester) at 100% at all 8 cores, the heat rises very slowly. Very quiet fans as well, you can only hear them if you manually change them to performance mode in Corsair Link. Lastly it's a very stylish looking cooler and I currently have it set to a cool blue led light. Highly recommend especially if you are getting a 9590. I returned a Kraken 120 mm cooler before I even installed it because I re thought my actions and decided to buy something with more cooling power because the 9590 is hot as hell (But not with this cooler XD). Anyway highly recommend, if you have an I7 and you're worried, don't be it can handle much hotter CPUs.
output: ",Excellent for the FX 9590

input: I have no idea how many \\""mice\\"" I've owned since 1993 when I bought my first computer, but I'm guessing there must have been a dozen or more. That said, I've never had a mouse I \\""didn't like.\\"" ...they always did what I expected them to. Not this one. I'll list the problems from \\""least annoying\\"" to \\""most.\\""<br /><br />1. I had read the other reviews about the \\""side buttons\\"" being positioned in a way that made them easy to \\""bump\\"" by accident. Well, the reviewers were right. I thought I'd get used to them but after over a month, I still bump them regularly.<br /><br />2. This mouse does not track as well as any of the others I've owned. (Sure, the old \\""ball tracking\\"" mice would get haired up and stop working from time to time, but that was easy enough to fix.) No \\""easy fix\\"" with this thing. ...I even mounted the receiver about 8 inches away from it (level line of sight) with no luck. Sometimes it does OK, other times it takes a while for it to \\""pick up and go.\\""<br /><br />3. The \\""left click\\"" button simply doesn't work about 30 percent of the time. ...it requires two, three, four, or sometimes more attempts before it responds. (So, imagine you're trying to close a window, or open an email, or launch an application...it's frustrating beyond words to \\""click\\"" and get nothing. \\""Click again, nothing, click again, nothing CLICK, nothing, CLICK!...you get the idea.)<br /><br />4. When typing in an email, word document or online form, the cursor gets \\""stuck\\"" wherever it was last (like it is \\""holding its place\\"") and the only way to move the cursor somewhere else is to first move the pointer to the old position and \\""release it\\"" with a left click.<br /><br />5. The most annoying thing this mouse does is it \\""locks on\\"" to whatever you've tried to click (say a hyperlink or maybe a shortcut icon...or an email, or a scroll bar) and it won't \\""let go\\"" of it. You end up dragging things all over your screen or \\""scrolling\\"" away from where you intended to be. (I'm sure this is an example of some \\""great new feature\\"" that nobody asked for...I've tried turning \\""click lock\\"" both ON and OFF repeatedly, but it hasn't worked.

input: I'm not sure what the negative reviews are all about.  I have 3 netgear R6300 Wireless AC routers and I'm getting around 700 mbs to the computer with this USB adapter on it.  I installed the lasted driver from the Netgear website and it's perfect.  I will say, much like the Asus internal Wireless AC adapter I have on another computer, it's important to use the antenna extender if you want full speed.  If you move the adapter around a little, the speed can change significantly.  However, I should also say that when the adapter is plugged directly into the computer (as you might do on a laptop) it's still getting a least 300 mbs - and since my fastest Comcast speed is 55 mbs, that's more than enough for surfing the web or downloading video.<br /><br />I use apple TV (I have 5) to stream from a server, and I can use this adapter to turn my iTunes (on this computer) into an apple TV.<br /><br />Very pleased.  I think the negative reviews are coming from people with old routers.
output: ",You guys know that you need an AC router to take full advantage right?

input: I connected a Sony DSR-45 DVcam videotape deck to my Lenovo T440 PC using this adapter and the laptop image immediately displayed a vertically rolling Venetian blind image superimposed over the normal PC desktop image. Then  Windows7 displayed the following warning: \\""Power Surge On Hub Port - A USB device has exceeded the power limits of its hub port...\\"".  I had purchased two units, so I tested the 2nd copy as a precaution, with the same error.<br /><br />Knowing that a vertically rolling Venetian blind effect is common to a ground loop between two AC powered video devices, I then tested the same scenario by connecting a Panasonic AG-DVX100B camcorder powered by battery to the Lenovo T440 PC, and got the same error message without the rolling Venetian blind visual image. Sony Vegas Pro video editing software did not recognize the connection to be compliant with IEEE-1394 firewire protocol. I cannot recommend this adapter unless the manufacturer can issue a software upload bug fix.

Great product, and you can't beat the price or shipping.

Now complete the following example-
input: I started with a 2GB a few years ago, then over time bought two other 4GB units.  I just now ordered an 8GB unit because it's only $19.97 with prime shipping - cheaper than the 4GB right now which is still at $39.99 - go figure.  MAIN SELLING POINT:  If this drive were to drop out of your pocket or purse, etc. onto the sidewalk (scenarios), or be burglarized from your house, the finder/stealer cannot see your data even though he/she has physical possession of the drive.  They could reformat the drive and use it for other purposes but they would NOT get access to your data.  After 10 failed login attempts the drive is programmed to lock out any access attempts and MUST be reformatted.  (Kingston has a built-in process that forces you to choose a decently complex password so bad guy is never going to guess your password in 10 tries.)  These have worked for me on both Windows 7 and the dreaded Windows Vista (I got rid of my one Vista PC about 6 months ago).  I now have Windows 7 on all PCs.  I have turned off autorun for security reasons.  Instead, I trudge down through Windows Explorer to find the DTPrivacy launcher file on the drive in the file tree.  It works, it's just some extra effort that's all.  I only dock this drive when I need to.  If it's not plugged in, it's less likely to be hacked.  Common sense.  Some people ( a few) might run into issues with the E: drive being blocked or in use because Explorer shows the E: drive letter is taken up by the CD/DVD optical drive (which is common).  It is not hard to get around this.  Either try taking the disk out of the Optical drive unit or you could go to Computer, Manager, Disk Management (IF you know what you're doing, be careful here) and reassign the drive letter of the Optical drive to a &#34;higher&#34; letter to remove the conflict.  ADDENDUM / OBSERVATIONS: I find that while doing a file save of CHANGES to a 28Megabyte using Microsoft Word to the Kingston drive of a particular .RTF file with a lot of mixed tables, graphics, custom text formatting can be dog slow (like 45 seconds to 1 minute) .  The hourglass for that save process takes over the entire computer.  Fortunately, I don't have to save that file very often.  I'm just used to it.  Yes I have tons of space  remaining (over a Gigabyte or more) on my Kingston drive and hard drives - that's not what's causing this.  I'm not worried about it.  I figure it's encryption processing that is parsing the entire content of the file for changes.  Just a guess.  My Text file and PDF file saves go quickly.  Years ago, in the early XP days, I did own an earlier 1GB gray colored predecessor of this drive which - it was eventually discovered - had a security flaw intrinsic to the firmware of that particular earlier series.  Kingston was aware of the flaw and discontinued that series long ago.  Back then these were like (trying to remember) $80 dollars(?) for 1GB.  I have deliberately passed on Windows version 8.X up till now so can't speak to usability.  I wasn't up for the aggravation although I'm told it runs faster.  Microsoft has recently announced (April 2014) that they will finally &#34;fix&#34; Windows 8.1 usability issues in two separate passes.  When they will drop the shoe on part 2 of the fix, I don't know.  I just know it's been announced.  In the meantime, I'm happy with Windows 7.  While I would be disappointed if my current blue DataTraveler drives didn't work in the revised Windows 8.X (or even future Windows 9), it wouldn't break my heart.  To have simple, reliable, off-line, self-contained security ( I leave one of these at work in case my home had a catastrophe) is a small price to pay for the peace of mind these relatively cheap backups bring.  If worst comes to worst I'll purchase the new iteration and be out max $80 - $100 for 4 drives that work with the latest greatest.  I doubt if it will come to that but if it does, no big deal.  ____________________________  UPDATE  Jan 2016  - none of these have ever failed me.   They also work fine with Windows 10 - no hassles or needed updates.  Can still recommend highly.

input: Pros:  * large memory (4GB) is great for high-res gaming, especially if you use high-resolution texture mods (Skyrim, Mass Effect, Fallout etc.) as these require a lot of video memory.  same goes for multi-monitor setups, but I am only using one monitor (1920x1200).  * surprisingly quiet and cool - you can read reviews, but with the three large, lower-RPM fans, this card is pretty quiet and is one of the best performers in it's class for temperature.  which means lots of temp headroom for overclocking ;-)  * good build quality - thick circuit boards, solid feel, nice heatsinks, HEAVY  * one of the fastest single-GPU cards on the market today.  great if you ever play old games that don't work will with multi-card setups or multi-GPU cards.  Cons:  * it's big big big big big.  Because it takes up three expansion slots, if you are using two of these together, you need a really big motherboard that can fit them both properly and get them into the right slots.  Know your case.  Know your motherboard.  * it's long long long long long - In my Antec 1200 case (a large, 12-bay case) I can't fit a standard 3.5&#34; HDD (non-solid-state drive) in front of the card (in a straight line with the card basically) and still use the Antec HDD cage with the built-in fan.  Just make SURE you have the space in your case, and room for the expansion slots on your motherboard, before you buy this card!!!  Measure!  It is long!  Details: The Antec 1200 comes with three, 3-drive cages, and then three empty slots for DVD drives.  Because there is a fan in front of the drives, the drives are moved closer to the video card than they would be if there was no fan.  So, I moved my DVD drive down from the top bay so that it is in-line with the card (since it is not as deep as a HDD), and moved the middle HDD cage to the top.  A bit of wiring to move around, but not the end of the world.  * Kind of expensive relative to the 4GB version of the GTX 670.  The 670 4GB (the one made by Gigabyte) is the same size, and has the same awesome three-fan cooling setup, but costs a lot less.  If you are OK with slightly lower performance of the 670 spec vs 680 spec, the 670 is a LOT better value.  2015 UPDATE: Retiring this card after years of faithful service, upgrading to a Gigabyte GTX 980 TI of similar design.  The three-fan setup rules them all.  Still highly recommended if you find one used.  Great card.

input: This is the perfect cover for Kindle Paperwhite for several reasons. It seems to be good protection for the Paperwhite when carried in something like a laptop bag, which is my primary consideration.  I also believe it will provide adequate protection against dropping (although I hope not to find out).  When reading, it's a very comfortable size, and best of all, the cover folds all the way back very easily - it's not stiff, and you don't feel like you're damaging the cover by folding it all the way back to read.<br /><br />I bought the Amazon leather cover for my Kindle Keyboard, but preferred to use a Timbuk2 sleeve instead.  The cover for the KK was bigger than I liked, and difficult to fold back when reading.  I preferred to read without a cover on the KK, but the Paperwhite is enough smaller that reading with the cover is actually more comfortable than reading without it.<br /><br />I was a little concerned about the price of this cover, particularly when thinking I'd want a sleeve as well. Now that I've tried this one, it'll be the only cover I need.  Still, it seems to me that it should be $10 cheaper.

input: I ordered the keyboard made for the 2nd gen Nexus 7 (2013). The first picture shows the nexus 7 being used in portrait mode on the keyboard. However, the only way this works is if you put the nexus 7 upside down into the slot, since the charging port is a little too big to fit in the slot. And once it's in portrait mode, the keyboard + tablet combo WILL fall over unless you constantly hold the keyboard. If you let go, the tablet will tip over. Otherwise, when used in landscape mode, this keyboard is pretty nice. Easy to pair with the nexus 7, and all the keys are working. Alt+tab even works to select a recent application. I'm using CM10.2 nightlies, instead of stock rom, no problem.

input: This InvisibleShield for my 10.1 inch Samsung Tab 3 was easy to put on my tablet, and as the instructions described, when dried<br />the bubbles/wrinkles that were there in the beginning, disappeared.  My only complaint is that the protection is not as good as<br />noted since there are a few scratches and nicks here and there after a while.  I use a stylist most of the time with a soft tip.  I'm just<br />saying that the &#34;shield&#34; is not as strong/protective as the description on the package describes.

input: Color orange is terrific.  It's a stylish shade, not too bright and not too dark.  I had originally gotten color blue but it was too dark so I returned it.  The case itself is sleek and sturdy.  I love how the light is tucked within the case.  You just pull the light out and it illuminates the screen, albeit weakly.  The problem is that the light is good for the top half but it's definitely not enough for the bottom half.  I tried reading in the dark but had to strain my eyes each time I read the bottom half.  After a while I got a headache from straining my eyes half the time.  I have given up reading my Kindle in the dark.      Amazon, PLEASE improve this lighted case so that the bottom half will be equally illuminated as the top half.

input: I love my View Pic Logitech 980186-0403 Silver USB Connector Desktop Microphone. Because I don't have to worry about drivers to download, and that it has easy plug-and-play, and that's what you get from the Logitech USB Desktop Microphone. You also get true digital quality and a noise-canceling technology to filter out unwanted background noise and deliver better voice recognition, better voice command, better voice recording, and more. Sleek, compact, and attractive, the itself is black, but on the pictures it looked like a very dark grey, and the base itself sliver. Nice...but I wished it would of been a all black color! Its also not built cheaply either, it is perfect for any desktop. This has got to be the best microphone I've ever owned. I'm thinging about getting my mom and younger brother one too! Note: You have be like a half foot away from the microphone, or you'll get distorted speech. For very cheap people this microphone isn't for you, because it cost almost 20 bucks! But I'm telling you it's worth it! Their is a 3.5mm version for 9.99 with 4.99 sh, links are below.   [...]    Pros:  Advanced digital USB provides superior clarity, The simplicity of a single plug-and-play connection, Noise-canceling microphone filters out unwanted background noise, Power switch illuminates when microphone is active, Microphone pivots on weighted, stable base to hold preferred position, 8 ft shielded cord with USB connector, offers convenience and flexibility around your desktop, Mute switch on base for easy control, Weighted base for stability.    Cons:  Not really a con, but just a piece of advice, you have to be a half foot away from the microphone, or get distorted speech.
output: ",Finally The Microphone I've Been Looking For!!!!!

Now complete the following example-
input: Pros: The keyboard came fully charged and links to my tablet well. Keyboard turns itself off after not being used. Case fits tablet snuggly.<br /><br />Cons: Does not have a way to prop tablet up-there should be a notch in the keyboard or something.  The case is too flimsy to stand on its own as in the picture so I have to prop it up against the top row of keys.  The case materials seems flimsy, I expect that the magnetic flap will get bent at some point in the future.  Also if I don't close it just right the keyboard punches the button on my tablet so that my tablet screams &#34;I CAN'T FIND A NETWORK CONNECTION.&#34; Pretty embarrassing, especially when it happened during a meeting.
