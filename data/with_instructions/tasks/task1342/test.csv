input: Overall, not very impressed.  This is the 2nd ASUS monitor I have, I have the VE228  as well in a dual monitor display.  The colors on this monitor suck, plain and simple.  Every time I sit down I think it looks too red, too washed out, too green after I adjust the red, the colors are not consistent at all, and the brightness suffers because of it.  Meanwhile, the other ASUS monitor I have that's 3 years old is exactly what I wanted this one to be.<br /><br />The monitor wobbles while I'm typing, it's not secured to the base very well.  I can tap the sides of both monitors, there is much more &#34;shake&#34; on this new monitor than the older one.<br /><br />It also seems to have a problem &#34;waking up&#34; when the computer has sat for a while.  I have to turn the power off and back on to get it to recognize, while the old monitor (currently set as monitor #2) works fine.<br /><br />I'm not very impressed, I am thinking of upgrading my ASUS motherboard to a newer one, but now have to exercise caution.

Now complete the following example-
input: This is the perfect keyboard for anybody who prefers to do their computing in a dark cave. After messing around with various lighting schemes for my desk, I just couldn't find the right balance.  What I really wanted was a back lighted keyboard like I have grown accustomed to on the [[ASIN:B007473X6A Apple MacBook Pro]].  This keyboard is exactly what I was looking for.  The lighting is gentle on the eyes and I am no longer struggling to find those seldom used keys on the fringes of the keyboard.  I chose this keyboard over the back lighted gaming keyboard because I wanted a quieter keyboard with less key travel with a feel similar to what I have on the laptop.  Again, this keyboard did not disappoint. For many years I have been using the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000. I was concerned that going back to the standard shaped keyboard would aggravate my carpal tunnel syndrome, however the shortened key travel and pressure seems to help mitigate the symptoms.  I highly recommend this keyboard.

It does not broadcast an SSID at all.  I called the folks at Amped and the answer i got was &#34;Sorry, its out of warranty&#34;.  So they basically said good luck with your SR300 which is now a doorstop.  Very disappointed in their customer service.

Graphite gray and white are the only colors.  If you do decide to buy the Kindle make sure you buy a case for it. I bought the Amazon leather case with the light - the case is kind of expensive but well worth it - you won't be disappointed with it and I especially enjoy the light.

input: I tried this on my Lenovo running XP and my Android phone.  What is supposed to happen is that when you are connected to the expander no matter where you homepage is it re-directs you to the NetGear site for further configuring.  Well it didn't work on my notebook and my smartphone attempted to connect but dropped because of internet quality.  So I figured this is going back!  I sat back in my recliner with my Android tablet to arrange an Amazon return when I thought I would try it on my tablet.  Well It Worked!  I was able to configure it so ALL devices that wish to connect can connect.  I'm not sure why the notebook (XP?) and Android phone would not connect but the Android tablet would, except for maybe since the tablet is the newest device, maybe it needs a Very recent OS?  You're guess is as good as mine but don't return until you try several different devices, and maybe a device or two from your friends/neighbors. By the way I'm using an AT&T modem/wifi router AND a LinkSys wifi router.  I need the AT&T for my internet service and the LinkSys for the T-Mobile Home Phone for $10/month, so I'm used to having much more difficulty with IP Cameras or any other Newtwork Accessory...

input: Very First Product  that I have felt so strongly about, that I just Had to write a review!!! Also First product Review Ever.<br />  I came across the Merc Stealth the first time between 10-14 years ago. It's been so long that I can't even remember the year I actually got it. My father in law had one. So I decided to buy it because of the unique setup on the left side of the keyboard. I was not disappointed! This keyboard has not only served me well in World of Warcraft, but also several other games as well. all played Dailey. A few of the keys started sticking last year so I replaced it. However I do think I could fix it and get it back up to running again.<br />  I thought that the Merc Stealth keyboard was no longer in production or I would have bought another one in a heartbeat!!! The Razer I now have is nice, but it's not a Merc Stealth!! The keyboard is a great gamers keyboard wether your a beginner or a pro!! I highly recommend you consider the Merc Stealth for all your PC & online gaming needs!! Happy gaming!!!
output: ",highly Recommended. Don't think to hard on it. just hit Buy It Now!! You won't regret it!!!

Now complete the following example-
input: The monitor I received as an A0 version but manufactured in July of 2014. I ordered it in October of 2014 so clearly this is current product. I suspect the versions indicated the plant where the monitor was manufactured not the technology in the unit. My monitor has an excellent picture and no buzzing. The only area that I feel needs clarifying is that the monitor can only display WQHD (1440) graphics on Dual Link DVI graphics interfaces with the Dual Link DVI cable or the Displayport. The VGA and HMDI interfaces cannot  go past HD resolution. This resulted in my needing to get a suitable graphics card and cable. This can be harder than it seems as most DVI are single link.  I found an EVGA card with an Nvidia GeForce GT610 GPU with 1 GB of ram works fabulously with my standard HP Pavillion power supply and delivers excellent performance. However, I am not gaming full screen and full resolution most of the time but instead doing Photo editing and CAD work.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is an excellent monitor with a minor restriction.

And since it's stuck with black and red, I can't really make any color work with it.<br /><br />I didn't want to spring for an $80 mouse so I made a $30 mistake with this. Next time I'm getting another Logitech.<br /><br />The software is clunky and confusing. It has several sensitivity settings, all too sensitive for my usage. I had to set one of the settings at the absolute lowest after suffering for a while trying to click things but having the mouse zoom past them.<br /><br />I have also had the mouse randomly reset the speed to horrendously slow. I don't really know why it does this, but I have to mess with the buttons to get it to fix itself.<br /><br />I am never buying this again.

input: First, I want to thank Amazon.com for providing a web site that allowed me to review what others said about this router, and others, before I made my purchase.  This info is invaluable.<br /><br />I just installed this router today to replace a D-Link WBR-2310 on my home network.  We have two computers using Ethernet connections to the router, a wireless notebook PC, and the Xbox 360 which is connected via an Ethernet cable.  With the WBR-2310, despite hours of screwing around with the configuration, the Xbox live connection would disconnect frequently; so, most of the time we had it connected directly to the modem, thus preventing simultaneous use of the internet on our PC's.<br /><br />The DGL-4300 was a dream (comparatively) to install.  I couldn't believe that it sniffed out the Xbox and the other computers automatically.  I didn't have to do a thing on the Xbox.  And, we have been able to play the Xbox live and use the internet on our PCs all day without any problem.

Now complete the following example-
input: I bought this product back in Aug 2012. As a computer it's awesome. Fast, light, awesome display and a decent battery life (about 5 hours with mixed usage).<br /><br />However, I gave it a 1 start because of a problem that happens with the models that have the LG display. The wireless antenna (located adjacent to the display cable) interferes with the display. The screen flickers all the time. At the begging, it used to go away when I restart the machine so I though it was a software bug. However, it got worse and now every time I connect to 2.4Ghz wireless network it flickers. Look it up in youtube and google (rMBP screen flicker).<br /><br />2 other minor issues:<br /><br />- LG display ghosting problem.<br />- It gets hot.<br /><br />My advise:<br />- Before you buy it, make sure you get the model with the Samsung screen not the LG model. If you get the model with the LG display return it. It will give your hard time.<br /><br />- Get apple care. Aside from the display, the fan seems it's about to fail. So having an applecare will protect your investment. I contacted apple regarding the wirless antenna issues since it's a design issue and my warranty expired. However, they don't have any plans to recall the defective units even though it's a wide spread issue.

This EMTA is for voice only.  Overall I am satisfied.

This trackball works decent at a range, and works great on the desk- no cables to get in the way and small usb dongel. Cleaning the ball and socket is easy and intuitive. Multiple falls from desk height to the floor and it still works well (as long as you don't loose the ball!). And, in my experience, easy on the batteries (maybe 2 or 3 times a YEAR at most with using it 8+ hrs a day 5 days a week).

Now complete the following example-
input: I just received this product today and I love it so much, I had to do a review immediately! Actually, I'm writing the review from the keyboard right now. I have the iPad 2 and the case fits like a glove. All the proper &#34;cut outs&#34; line up fine. I don't really use the camera much on my iPad, but the cutout is perfect in case i do. A HUGE thanks to Sinjon Vision who uploaded the photos. Honestly, those images are what sealed the deal for me. I met someone who had this case in red, which I had considered, but I wanted something a little different. The white stiching is a great contrast to the light brown color. The best part, as other reviewers have mentioned, is the velcro on the bottom of the part that holds the iPad. It's GREAT for positioning the iPad to many different angles, and it actually stays. My previous case (with no keyboard) has grooves to position the iPad but there are only two options and it kept slipping all the time: quite annoying. The ability to move the keyboard out is awesome! it gives you much more flexibilty so that you don't feel too cramped when typing. The keyboard is a little small to me, but that's not a big deal. I have fairly small hands. If you have larger hands, typing may be a little challenging unless you're accustomed to smaller keyboards; but if you really need a larger keyboard, my guess is that you'd be on a desktop or laptop and getting this case would be a moot point.  The only thing that could make this case even better is if the part that holds the iPad would pivot. Currently, the case is designed to hold the iPad in landscape mode only. This is great for typing with the keyboard, but when I read books or magazines, I prefer the portrait mode and it would be great to have the velcro feature in portrait mode. All in all, I love this case! And the price point is excellent. I paid half of the retail price. Can't beat it!
