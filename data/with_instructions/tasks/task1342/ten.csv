input: Bought cables in 3ft, 6ft and 9ft.  NONE of them worked.  NO FUNCTIONALITY WHATSOEVER.  Tested many times, its as if the copper wires are just not connected to the terminations.  Do these even go through Quality Control before they leave the factory?  Waste of money and time.

Now complete the following example-
input: LOVE this case!  Have one for my phone and wanted to replace what I was using on my iPad.  So glad I did.  Love that my screen is protected and all the ports are covered.  Comes with a stand, but I put it in a drawer and never use it because of the extra bulk and weight. Do not miss it al all.  I put this in my Amazon cart and waited for the price to come down before purchasing. Got it for $48. Can't imagine anyone not liking this case!
output: ",Awesome
