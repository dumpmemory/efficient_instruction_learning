input: Abstract: Some patients converted from ventricular fibrillation to organized rhythms by defibrillation-trained ambulance technicians (EMT-Ds) will refibrillate before hospital arrival. The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.

input: Abstract: Between January 1979 and June 1985, 10 patients with acute allergic interstitial nephritis were seen in a clinical nephrology service at a large regional hospital. The onset of renal failure was temporally related to the use of a drug: a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) (in four patients), cimetidine (in three), antibiotics (in two) or allopurinol (in one). The onset of renal failure was acute in three patients and insidious in seven. Two patients also exhibited marked proteinuria. Clinical features such as fever, rash, hematuria, pyuria with or without eosinophiluria, and mild to marked proteinuria had led to suspicion of the disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by renal biopsy findings of inflammatory cells, predominantly lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils. Three patients required hemodialysis; two of them received steroids as well. Steroid therapy was also used in two patients with NSAID-induced proteinuria. Renal function improved in nine patients by 35 days, but one patient continued to have slow but progressive deterioration of renal function. Acute interstitial nephritis can be distinguished from other forms of acute renal failure by heavy renal uptake of gallium 67, maximal 48 hours or more after injection. The improvement in renal function after discontinuation of the implicated drug, the characteristic histopathological findings of allergic interstitial nephritis, and the presence of eosinophils and sometimes IgE in the blood suggest a hypersensitivity reaction.

input: Abstract: While the ambiguity of suicidal patients' stated motivations has been studied in some detail, less attention has been given to the changeability of their motivations. Twenty-six patients who had taken an overdose of paraquat, a highly lethal herbicide, were questioned about their motivation at the time of admission and 24 hours and 3, 7 and 10 days later. Although 25 patients claimed that they wished to die at the time of admission, all of the 14 surviving patients wished to live at the time of discharge from hospital. Of the 12 patients who died, 6 stated that they no longer wished to die in the last interview before their death. During the following year 3 of the 14 surviving patients killed themselves. The findings emphasize the importance of thoroughly assessing all aspects of the suicidal patient's situation in determining risks. The patient's stated intentions should be but one factor considered.
output: ",Changing motivation in severely suicidal patients.

input: Abstract: Off-road vehicles have attained growing popularity, expanding markets and increasing rates of associated injury, especially among young people. In 1984-85, 148 patients were treated at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, for injuries suffered in off-road vehicle accidents. The average age of the patients was 14 years. Soft-tissue injuries occurred in 33 patients, 21 of whom had severe injuries. There were 179 fractures in 133 patients. One patient died as a result of his injuries. The most common mechanism of injury was losing control of and tumbling from the machine. Seventeen patients were struck by their own vehicles, and 39 collided with objects such as cars, trees or people. The health care costs of these accidents are no less serious than the concerns for the appropriate legislation to protect consumers, particularly the young.

input: Abstract: The prognostic value of marrow chromosome findings was examined in 242 patients with preleukemic myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), with emphasis on the significance of single versus multiple karyotypic changes. In both groups, the results showed that patients with multiple chromosome abnormalities in a marrow clone had a very high probability of early death, from progression to leukemia or from other complications of hematopoietic dysfunction. Conversely, in patients with a hemic clone having only one karyotypic alteration (involving a single chromosome or single translocation), survival over 2 years was only slightly reduced as compared to those without chromosome abnormality. The only single karyotypic alteration perhaps associated with a markedly shortened survival was monosomy 7. These findings suggest that the conclusions of previous studies concerning the grave consequences of chromosome alterations in preleukemia largely reflect the clinical significance of clones with multiple cytogenetic changes. Prior knowledge of the karyotypic status of preleukemic patients should be helpful in evaluating current attempts to find effective treatment for these difficult disorders.

input: Abstract: Ninety-six patients with disseminated malignant melanoma received thrice weekly intramuscular injections of leukocyte A recombinant interferon (rIFN-alpha A, Roferon-A, Hoffmann La Roche) at doses of 12 X 10(6) U/m2 or 50 X 10(6) U/m2 with or without cimetidine as an immunorestorative agent. Four patients, two with prior chemotherapy, demonstrated either a complete response (3 months, soft tissue metastasis) or exceptionally durable response durations (months) of 29+ (soft tissue; lung lesion), 31+ (soft tissue), and 35+ (soft tissue; liver lesions). None of these patients had particularly characteristic clinical parameters. As noted previously, using chemotherapy, a small proportion of patients with advanced malignant melanoma, despite prior therapy, may achieve prolonged objective regression with rIFN-alpha A.

input: Abstract: Methylglyoxal bis (guanylhydrazone) (MGBG) is an inhibitor of polyamine synthesis. In vitro studies demonstrate the accumulation of some tumor cells in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Nineteen patients with advanced head and neck cancer were entered in a Phase II trial of MGBG. MGBG, 500 mg/M2, was administered as a brief intravenous infusion weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks. Dose modifications were based on cumulative toxicity after 2 weekly treatments. All but three patients had prior exposure to chemotherapy for disease recurrence. Of 17 patients evaluable for response and toxicity, one brief partial response was observed. The most common toxicities were mild to moderate nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomatitis. Myelosuppression occurred in three patients. Dose modifications were required in four patients; a maximum dose of 700 mg/M2 was tolerated. The results of four other Phase II single and combination chemotherapy trials of MGBG in head and neck cancer are reviewed. The single agent response rate in 59 patients was 22% (range, 6%-41%). The poor response rate observed in this trial was similar to that in other trials in which a heavily pretreated group of patients was evaluated. It is concluded that single agent MGBG is not a useful drug in heavily pretreated recurrent disease patients. However, because of its biochemical effects, further testing in combination with cycle specific agents and in larger numbers of patients with minimal prior treatment may be warranted.

input: Abstract: Between July 1973 and December 1979, 1171 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy. Of those patients, 195 had osseous metastases only. Upon initial diagnosis, 48% had osteolytic metastases; 13% had osteoblastic metastases; 38% had mixed metastases; and 1% had diffuse osteoporosis without any obvious bone destruction. The most common sites of involvement were the dorsal spine (62%), lumbosacral spine (72%), and pelvis (79%). Objective response to chemotherapy was observed in 59% of patients; complete responses were noted in 7%, and partial responses in 52%. The median survival was 28 months (range, 1-118 months). The median time lapse between the start of chemotherapy and disease progression was 14 months (range, 1-109 months). In 32 patients who responded to the treatment, chemotherapy was discontinued after 2 years, and their median duration of continued remission at 39 and 75 months after the completion of therapy. The incidence of pathological fractures was 57%; the most common sites were the spine, which sustained compression fractures, and the ribs. The incidences of hypercalcemia and spinal cord compression due to metastases were 19% and 10%, respectively.

input: Abstract: Two patients with metastatic dysgerminoma of the ovary were treated with a combination of etoposide, bleomycin, and cisplatin at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute at Houston. Both patients achieved a complete remission. Patient 1 developed a massive recurrence in the para-aortic lymph nodes 21 months after diagnosis and treatment with right salpingo-oophorectomy alone. She received four cycles of chemotherapy and is free of disease 21 months from the start of chemotherapy. Patient 2 had Stage III dysgerminoma and a lymphangiogram positive for tumor in the para-aortic lymph nodes. After surgery she received three cycles of chemotherapy and is free of disease 20 months from the start of chemotherapy. Both complete remissions were documented with second-look laparotomy. Chemotherapy may be an alternative to radiotherapy for the treatment of metastatic dysgerminoma and should also be considered for selected patients with Stage I disease. A literature review further supports the conclusion that additional clinical trials might expand the indications for chemotherapy in patients with this disease.

input: Abstract: Forty-three of 79 patients treated for clinically metastatic germ cell cancer survived for a median of 66 months (range, 52-83). In patients without previous chemotherapy the 5-year survival rate was 69%, whereas only 32% of patients with prior chemotherapy survived for 5 years. Limited disease, complete clinical response, histopathologically proven postchemotherapy tumor necrosis or complete resectability of a posttreatment mature teratoma indicated a favorable prognosis in patients without prior chemotherapy. Only 20% to 30% of the patients with less than a clinical complete response or with posttreatment residual malignant tumor can be salvaged by second line therapy. Posttreatment mature teratoma should be resected completely whenever possible, as this condition may lead to reactivation of the malignancy even after several years. Raynaud-like phenomena and/or gastrointestinal problems are the main long-term sequel (10%-15%) after modern multimodality treatment of advanced germ cell cancer (fertility-related problems are not considered here). In the majority of surviving patients, the lifestyle seems unaffected by the previous intensive treatment, evaluated about 5 years after discontinuation of all therapy.
