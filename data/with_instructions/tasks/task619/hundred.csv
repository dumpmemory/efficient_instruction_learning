input: Abstract: Some patients converted from ventricular fibrillation to organized rhythms by defibrillation-trained ambulance technicians (EMT-Ds) will refibrillate before hospital arrival. The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.

input: Abstract: Between January 1979 and June 1985, 10 patients with acute allergic interstitial nephritis were seen in a clinical nephrology service at a large regional hospital. The onset of renal failure was temporally related to the use of a drug: a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) (in four patients), cimetidine (in three), antibiotics (in two) or allopurinol (in one). The onset of renal failure was acute in three patients and insidious in seven. Two patients also exhibited marked proteinuria. Clinical features such as fever, rash, hematuria, pyuria with or without eosinophiluria, and mild to marked proteinuria had led to suspicion of the disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by renal biopsy findings of inflammatory cells, predominantly lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils. Three patients required hemodialysis; two of them received steroids as well. Steroid therapy was also used in two patients with NSAID-induced proteinuria. Renal function improved in nine patients by 35 days, but one patient continued to have slow but progressive deterioration of renal function. Acute interstitial nephritis can be distinguished from other forms of acute renal failure by heavy renal uptake of gallium 67, maximal 48 hours or more after injection. The improvement in renal function after discontinuation of the implicated drug, the characteristic histopathological findings of allergic interstitial nephritis, and the presence of eosinophils and sometimes IgE in the blood suggest a hypersensitivity reaction.

input: Abstract: While the ambiguity of suicidal patients' stated motivations has been studied in some detail, less attention has been given to the changeability of their motivations. Twenty-six patients who had taken an overdose of paraquat, a highly lethal herbicide, were questioned about their motivation at the time of admission and 24 hours and 3, 7 and 10 days later. Although 25 patients claimed that they wished to die at the time of admission, all of the 14 surviving patients wished to live at the time of discharge from hospital. Of the 12 patients who died, 6 stated that they no longer wished to die in the last interview before their death. During the following year 3 of the 14 surviving patients killed themselves. The findings emphasize the importance of thoroughly assessing all aspects of the suicidal patient's situation in determining risks. The patient's stated intentions should be but one factor considered.

input: Abstract: Off-road vehicles have attained growing popularity, expanding markets and increasing rates of associated injury, especially among young people. In 1984-85, 148 patients were treated at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, for injuries suffered in off-road vehicle accidents. The average age of the patients was 14 years. Soft-tissue injuries occurred in 33 patients, 21 of whom had severe injuries. There were 179 fractures in 133 patients. One patient died as a result of his injuries. The most common mechanism of injury was losing control of and tumbling from the machine. Seventeen patients were struck by their own vehicles, and 39 collided with objects such as cars, trees or people. The health care costs of these accidents are no less serious than the concerns for the appropriate legislation to protect consumers, particularly the young.

input: Abstract: The prognostic value of marrow chromosome findings was examined in 242 patients with preleukemic myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), with emphasis on the significance of single versus multiple karyotypic changes. In both groups, the results showed that patients with multiple chromosome abnormalities in a marrow clone had a very high probability of early death, from progression to leukemia or from other complications of hematopoietic dysfunction. Conversely, in patients with a hemic clone having only one karyotypic alteration (involving a single chromosome or single translocation), survival over 2 years was only slightly reduced as compared to those without chromosome abnormality. The only single karyotypic alteration perhaps associated with a markedly shortened survival was monosomy 7. These findings suggest that the conclusions of previous studies concerning the grave consequences of chromosome alterations in preleukemia largely reflect the clinical significance of clones with multiple cytogenetic changes. Prior knowledge of the karyotypic status of preleukemic patients should be helpful in evaluating current attempts to find effective treatment for these difficult disorders.

Four patients, two with prior chemotherapy, demonstrated either a complete response (3 months, soft tissue metastasis) or exceptionally durable response durations (months) of 29+ (soft tissue; lung lesion), 31+ (soft tissue), and 35+ (soft tissue; liver lesions). None of these patients had particularly characteristic clinical parameters. As noted previously, using chemotherapy, a small proportion of patients with advanced malignant melanoma, despite prior therapy, may achieve prolonged objective regression with rIFN-alpha A.

input: Abstract: Methylglyoxal bis (guanylhydrazone) (MGBG) is an inhibitor of polyamine synthesis. In vitro studies demonstrate the accumulation of some tumor cells in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Nineteen patients with advanced head and neck cancer were entered in a Phase II trial of MGBG. MGBG, 500 mg/M2, was administered as a brief intravenous infusion weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks. Dose modifications were based on cumulative toxicity after 2 weekly treatments. All but three patients had prior exposure to chemotherapy for disease recurrence. Of 17 patients evaluable for response and toxicity, one brief partial response was observed. The most common toxicities were mild to moderate nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomatitis. Myelosuppression occurred in three patients. Dose modifications were required in four patients; a maximum dose of 700 mg/M2 was tolerated. The results of four other Phase II single and combination chemotherapy trials of MGBG in head and neck cancer are reviewed. The single agent response rate in 59 patients was 22% (range, 6%-41%). The poor response rate observed in this trial was similar to that in other trials in which a heavily pretreated group of patients was evaluated. It is concluded that single agent MGBG is not a useful drug in heavily pretreated recurrent disease patients. However, because of its biochemical effects, further testing in combination with cycle specific agents and in larger numbers of patients with minimal prior treatment may be warranted.

input: Abstract: Between July 1973 and December 1979, 1171 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy. Of those patients, 195 had osseous metastases only. Upon initial diagnosis, 48% had osteolytic metastases; 13% had osteoblastic metastases; 38% had mixed metastases; and 1% had diffuse osteoporosis without any obvious bone destruction. The most common sites of involvement were the dorsal spine (62%), lumbosacral spine (72%), and pelvis (79%). Objective response to chemotherapy was observed in 59% of patients; complete responses were noted in 7%, and partial responses in 52%. The median survival was 28 months (range, 1-118 months). The median time lapse between the start of chemotherapy and disease progression was 14 months (range, 1-109 months). In 32 patients who responded to the treatment, chemotherapy was discontinued after 2 years, and their median duration of continued remission at 39 and 75 months after the completion of therapy. The incidence of pathological fractures was 57%; the most common sites were the spine, which sustained compression fractures, and the ribs. The incidences of hypercalcemia and spinal cord compression due to metastases were 19% and 10%, respectively.

Both patients achieved a complete remission. Patient 1 developed a massive recurrence in the para-aortic lymph nodes 21 months after diagnosis and treatment with right salpingo-oophorectomy alone. She received four cycles of chemotherapy and is free of disease 21 months from the start of chemotherapy. Patient 2 had Stage III dysgerminoma and a lymphangiogram positive for tumor in the para-aortic lymph nodes. After surgery she received three cycles of chemotherapy and is free of disease 20 months from the start of chemotherapy. Both complete remissions were documented with second-look laparotomy. Chemotherapy may be an alternative to radiotherapy for the treatment of metastatic dysgerminoma and should also be considered for selected patients with Stage I disease. A literature review further supports the conclusion that additional clinical trials might expand the indications for chemotherapy in patients with this disease.

input: Abstract: Forty-three of 79 patients treated for clinically metastatic germ cell cancer survived for a median of 66 months (range, 52-83). In patients without previous chemotherapy the 5-year survival rate was 69%, whereas only 32% of patients with prior chemotherapy survived for 5 years. Limited disease, complete clinical response, histopathologically proven postchemotherapy tumor necrosis or complete resectability of a posttreatment mature teratoma indicated a favorable prognosis in patients without prior chemotherapy. Only 20% to 30% of the patients with less than a clinical complete response or with posttreatment residual malignant tumor can be salvaged by second line therapy. Posttreatment mature teratoma should be resected completely whenever possible, as this condition may lead to reactivation of the malignancy even after several years. Raynaud-like phenomena and/or gastrointestinal problems are the main long-term sequel (10%-15%) after modern multimodality treatment of advanced germ cell cancer (fertility-related problems are not considered here). In the majority of surviving patients, the lifestyle seems unaffected by the previous intensive treatment, evaluated about 5 years after discontinuation of all therapy.

input: Abstract: Of a total of 1561 patients registered in the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS) as of May 1983, 78 patients (5%) were younger than 1 year of age. These infants did not differ from the older children (1-20 years of age) in male/female ratio, clinical grouping, or survival rates. Infants younger than 1 year of age had a significantly greater frequency of undifferentiated sarcoma, 18% versus 7% in older children (P less than 0.005). Infants also had a significantly greater proportion of cancers with botryoid pathology, 10% versus 4% in older children (P less than 0.005). When reviewed by the newly proposed IRS cytopathologic classification, there was no difference in pathologic types between the two age groups. Infants younger than 1 year of age had a higher rate of bladder-prostate-vagina primary tumor sites than older children, 24% versus 10% (P less than 0.05). In addition, infants tended to receive less of the prescribed doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy than older children, and to develop more toxicity to treatment than older children. Despite these differences, the overall survival curve for the two age groups appears to be similar. In contrast to Wilms' tumor and neuroblastoma, in which age (less than 1 year) is a favorable prognostic factor, age does not appear to be an important prognostic factor in rhabdomyosarcoma.

These three patients have had unmaintained disease-free survivals of 36+, 100+, and 105+ months. This study indicates that BAM-M is effective therapy for advanced stage mycosis fungoides and suggests that the therapeutic role of splenectomy should be evaluated further.

input: Abstract: Some patients converted from ventricular fibrillation to organized rhythms by defibrillation-trained ambulance technicians (EMT-Ds) will refibrillate before hospital arrival. The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.

input: Abstract: In 37 patients with seemingly localized non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the Waldeyer's ring (WR-NHL), lymphangiography (LAG) and/or gallium-67 scans (Ga-67 scans) were done. Before these procedures, 20 patients were diagnosed as Stage I, and 17 as Stage II. LAG was done for 30, and Ga-67 scans for 32, 25 of whom had both. Five patients (16%) were upstaged to Stage III or IV by Ga-67 scans. Only one (3%) had abnormal LAG findings, in whom Ga-67 scans also showed abnormal accumulation in the para-aortic region. Because of this low positive rate, LAG is not recommended for staging of WR-NHL.

The number of high-affinity rosette-forming cells (HARFC) was found to be significantly decreased in OSMF and oral cancer, whereas the number of total rosette-forming cells (TRFC) remained unaltered. Levels of serum IgA, IgD, and IgE were found to be elevated both in OSMF and oral cancer. Immunologic derangements were found to be more pronounced in oral cancer than in OSMF. The enumeration of HARFC along with the estimation of serum levels of IgA, IgD, and IgE indicates that OSMF can be an intermediary stage in the malignant transformation of a normal cell, and that these parameters may serve as markers for the early detection of oral cancer.

input: Abstract: A total of 422 patients with malignant lymphoma of bone who were seen at the Mayo Clinic from 1907 through 1982 were placed into four major groups based on stage of disease. There was one group with primary lymphoma of bone, one group with multifocal osseous lymphoma, and two groups with lymphoma of bone and nodal or soft tissue (or both) disease. The last-mentioned two groups were separated on the basis of time of onset of osseous lymphoma in relation to the nonosseous disease. The stage of disease was the single most important prognostic indicator of overall survival in malignant lymphoma of bone. The 5- and 10-year survival rates were, respectively, 58% and 53% for patients with primary bone lymphoma, 22% and 12.5% for patients with bone and nodal or soft tissue (or both) disease, and 42% and 35% for patients with multifocal osseous disease. Features having no significant prognostic value were sex of the patient, histologic grade of the lymphoma (according to the Working Formulation and the Kiel system), and presence of T-cell features or cleaved cells (or both). This study is not able to adequately address efficacy of treatment. In fact, treatment may be very important in outcome.

input: Abstract: Head and neck cancer has rarely been reported to be a cause of meningeal carcinomatosis. These tumors are known more for their local invasiveness rather than distant metastasis. This would appear to preclude meningeal involvement, but close proximity to multiple cranial nerves may provide an access to the meninges. Six cases of head and neck cancer with meningeal invasion are presented. All six cases had malignant cells in their cerebrospinal fluid. Three cases had malignant cells recovered from a ventricular specimen after lumbar punctures were negative. The most common clinical finding on presentation was cranial nerve involvement. The optic nerve was involved most often with nerves VI and V the next most frequent. Headache was present in four patients and seizures occurred in two. No patient had meningismus. Our current treatment plan involves insertion of an Ommaya Reservoir and intraventricular methotrexate. Only patients whose primary head and neck tumor shows a response to systemic therapy undergo Ommaya placement. Meningeal carcinomatosis in head and neck cancer may be more prevalent than previously thought and the likely mechanism is via direct extension rather than hematogenous spread.

input: Abstract: The serum testosterone level (STL) was determined in 84 male and 32 female patients with gastric carcinoma and in 58 male and 20 female patients with benign diseases as a control group. The STL of the male patients with carcinoma was lower (446 +/- 149 ng/dl) than that of the male control group (532 +/- 132 ng/dl) (P less than 0.001). Even 17 male patients of the early carcinoma showed lower STL (440 +/- 117 ng/dl) than the normal group (P less than 0.001). In the female patients, it was also lower (31.6 +/- 16.0 ng/dl) than in the control group (46.3 +/- 15.3 ng/dl) (P less than 0.005). The postoperative STL of the cases surviving the gastrectomy was higher than the preoperative data in 32 male patients (P less than 0.005) as well as in 12 female patients (0.025 greater than P greater than 0.01), whereas it obviously decreased in the patients who died of recurrence. Therefore, it appears that gastric carcinoma decreases the STL by some mechanism.

The current investigation determined the TSA, LASA, total protein (TP), and TSA/TP values for 171 cancer patients with various primary sites and differing degrees of metastatic disease, 102 patients with nonmalignant diseases (pathologic controls), and 42 normal individuals. Data analysis indicated significant (p less than 0.01) increases in the mean (+/- SD) TSA and TSA/TP values in the cancer patients (78.1 +/- 19.2 mg/dl and 12.4 +/- 3.8 mg/g, respectively) and in the pathologic controls (76.0 +/- 7.5 mg/dl and 11.6 +/- 2.5 mg/g) when compared to the normal controls (67.3 +/- 7.1 mg/dl and 9.0 +/- 1.1 mg/g), and a significant decrease in the mean TP values in the cancer patients (6.4 +/- 1.1 g/dl) and pathologic controls (6.6 +/- 1.1 g/dl) when compared to normal controls (7.5 +/- 0.5 g/dl). No significant difference was observed between groups in LASA values. Further analysis of the data in patient subgroups based on the tissue involved, specific disease, or severity of the malignancy indicated that the lack of specificity of the markers was due primarily to restricted subgroups and that the sensitivity of TSA and TSA/TP increased as the malignancy became more severe. The results show that TSA/TP was the most useful of the markers tested for detecting malignancies. This marker should prove useful for monitoring malignant disease recurrence and/or progression and for evaluating the effectiveness of various therapeutic approaches.

The cranial nerve palsies frequently observed with the tumors are related to the anatomic locations of the tumors. Thirteen patients with this entity are presented and the eleven other cases in the literature are reviewed. Histologically the tumors are low grade and exhibit myxoid features. The myxoid features must be differentiated from chordoma and chondroid chordoma. The tumor locations preclude surgical excision and conventional radiation therapy can cause unacceptable neurologic sequelae. Proton beam therapy has been effective in short-term results and appears capable of avoiding serious neurologic side effects.

Two patients had a small cell carcinoma of the lung. In the third case, the histologic features of the brain metastases were consistent with a neuron-specific enolase-positive, small cell anaplastic carcinoma. Involvement of the choroid plexus and leptomeninges was moderate or absent. Intraparenchymatous nodular metastases were not found except in one case in which rare nodular superficial cortical metastases were present. The clinical data were nonspecific except for orthostatic hypotension, in one patient, which was probably due to the infiltration of the floor of the third and fourth ventricles. Results of the cerebrospinal fluid examination, available in two cases, were normal. The only diagnostic investigation was contrast-enhanced computed tomography scanning.

input: Abstract: Multivariate analysis on an unselected patient population consisting of all 253 children treated for neuroblastoma in Denmark during 1943 to 1980 shows that stage, age, and treatment given are independent prognostic variables. Calendar year of diagnosis, sex of the patient, and site of primary tumor were not significant prognostic factors. Further analysis shows that multimodal treatment with surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, especially in patients older than 1 year of age with Stage II disease, has influenced the survival significantly. The fact that age at diagnosis and the administration of chemotherapy have independent prognostic significance can be explained by the theory that all neuroblastomas are virtually congenital; therefore, the difference in age at diagnosis largely reflects the difference in growth rates of the tumor. Thus, according to this theory, age may be a measure of the probability of micrometastases in addition to the clinical extent or stage of the disease, as it represents the duration of the disease. Additional chemotherapy may thus have eradicated these micrometastases in the older children, since the age influence on Stage II disease disappeared when multimodal treatment was given in this study. The implications for treatment policy are discussed in view of this theory.

input: Abstract: Traditional therapy for malignant pleural effusions includes thoracentesis or tube drainage with instillation of irritants to achieve pleurodesis. This can require a lengthy hospitalization, causes pain and discomfort, and has an appreciable failure rate. Because of these drawbacks, the authors used a shunting device to transfer fluid to the peritoneal cavity in 17 patients with malignant pleural effusions. Eleven patients had undergone previous therapeutic thoracenteses and three had chest tube placement with failed sclerosis. The shunt was a subcutaneous valved pump chamber with attached pleural and peritoneal catheters, which used manual compression to transfer fluid against the normal abdominal/pleural pressure gradient. Operative placement under local or general anesthesia was performed without complication. Five patients achieved minimal benefit, either because of moribund status or their inability to compress the pump effectively. In the other 12 patients, there was radiographic evidence of diminished or stabilized pleural effusion; respiratory symptoms were effectively palliated, and no further treatment for their effusion was required. Peritoneal dissemination of malignant cells has not been clinically detected. We feel that pleuroperitoneal shunting is a valid new method for treatment of malignant pleural effusions which can effectively palliate respiratory symptoms with low morbidity. Advantages include the absence of external tubing and the possibility for only a short hospitalization or even outpatient placement.

The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.

input: Abstract: Many patients with diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma have dyspnea or chest pain. Cardiac symptomatology is frequently difficult to differentiate from symptoms of pleuropulmonary disease. To better define the clinical characteristics of cardiac involvement in patients with mesothelioma, the electrocardiographic (EKG) and echocardiographic findings in 64 patients with biopsy-proven malignant pleural mesothelioma were reviewed. A total of 19/64 (30%) patients had autopsy studies available for review. The EKG was abnormal in 55 patients (89%). Over half (60%) had an arrhythmia, including sinus tachycardia (42%), premature atrial and ventricular contractions (13%), atrial fibrillation (3%), and atrial flutter (1%). Over one third (37%) had a conduction abnormality, including bundle branch block (13%), hemiblock (8.5%), and incomplete right bundle branch block (13%). Echocardiography revealed a total of 13 patients with pericardial effusions, two with pericardial thickening, and one with an anterior sonolucent space. Of 19 autopsies, cardiac invasion was found in 14 (74%), with more than half to the pericardium and more than one quarter to the myocardium. It is concluded that: clinical cardiac abnormalities occur in the great majority of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, pathologic cardiac invasion occurs in the great majority of patients with pleural mesothelioma, and the EKG and echocardiogram are helpful in differentiating cardiac involvement from progressive pulmonary disease in patients with pleural mesothelioma.

input: Abstract: Simultaneous urinary flow cytometry, cytologic, and cystoscopic examinations were performed at 3-month intervals for a minimum of 1 year on 29 patients receiving intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) treatment of superficial bladder carcinoma. Flow cytometry (FCM) and cytology were concordant in 57 of 103 examinations; both FCM and cytology were positive in 38 instances, and carcinoma was confirmed by biopsy in 35 (92.1%). In 16 instances FCM and cytology were negative, but carcinoma was present on biopsy in 5 (31.3%). Three examinations were suspicious by both techniques. The 46 determinations with discordant FCM and cytology were subdivided into pathologically confirmed recurrences (25 instances) and no evidence of pathologic and/or cystoscopic disease (21 instances). In the 25 instances of recurrences, FCM was positive in 18 (72.0%), suspicious in 3 (12.0%), and negative in 4 (16.0%), while cytology was positive in 3 (12.0%), suspicious in 9 (36.0%), and negative in 13 (52.0%). Most patients had a severe BCG-induced inflammatory response that caused an elevation of the hyperdiploid population, believed secondary to epithelial regeneration and proliferation. In the 21 instances without detectable recurrence, hyperploidy led to a relatively high proportion of positive (15) and suspicious (4) results by FCM, but only eight had distinct aneuploid populations. It is possible that this latter group, at least, is harboring occult carcinoma. Conventional cytology in the nonrecurrent group was positive in 1 (4.8%), suspicious in 7 (33.3%), and negative in 13 (61.9%). In those instances when tumor was confirmed by biopsy, the false-negative rate for FCM was 19.7%; the false-negative rate for cytology was 40.9%. Thus, FCM appears to be more sensitive but less specific than conventional cytology, having a lower false-negative but a higher false-positive rate. Although serial FCM provides an objective quantitative measure of aneuploid stemlines and hyperdiploid populations in bladder irrigation specimens and can be helpful in following intravesical BCG therapy for superficial bladder carcinoma, it should still be used with conventional cytology. The greatest difficulty with FCM at present, as with conventional cytology, is in cases of marked inflammation. The results reported here were obtained under the most stringent conditions and represent the minimum level of accuracy. Potential improvements in the technique, with the addition of immunologic or other markers, hold hope of further increasing the accuracy of FCM.

input: Abstract: The effects of preoperative irradiation on the morphology of transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) were evaluated by studying the pretreatment biopsy and radical cystectomy specimens from 35 patients. Twenty-six of these patients had received 2000 rad within the week preceding surgery, and nine patients had received no preoperative treatment. The frequency of bladders without residual TCC was 23% for irradiated and 22% for nonirradiated cases. Of the TCCs classified as papillary in the biopsy specimens and irradiated, 79% lacked a papillary component at cystectomy, but in no case was the invasive component eliminated or regression from muscle invasion to superficial TCC noticed. Flat carcinoma in situ (CIS) did not respond to irradiation. At cystectomy nuclear pleomorphism was greater than at biopsy in 60% of the irradiated TCCs, whereas all nonirradiated cases retained the same grade as at biopsy. In addition, irradiation induced squamous differentiation in neoplastic cells only, without affecting the nonneoplastic urothelium.

input: Abstract: The importance of the once-obscure right ventricle is becoming evident. Even in disorders that primarily affect the left ventricle, the once-considered-passive conduit has proved essential for maintenance of normal cardiac output. In coronary artery disease, the function of the right ventricle is affected by both its circulation and the after-load placed on it by dysfunction of the left ventricle. In congestive heart failure, right ventricular function relates to functional capacity, whereas left ventricular function does not, and right ventricular ejection fraction is a useful prognostic guide in these patients. In mitral and aortic valvular disease, the role of the right ventricle is only now becoming evident, and the precise interplay of all factors has yet to be explained. In systemic hypertension, it is likely that the pulmonary circulation is affected by the same humoral factors that elevate systemic pressures.

input: Abstract: A considerable amount of literature has been devoted to compromise of the right ventricle in spontaneous myocardial infarction. Little information is available regarding disproportionate dysfunction of the right ventricle associated with cardiac operation and the recovery period therefrom. Recognition of the problem is of paramount importance, if support measures are to be implemented. A great deal has yet to be learned regarding the appropriate support for the acutely failing right ventricle. Much remains to be accomplished regarding the assessment of right ventricle reserve, defining the role of risk factors, and quantitating the value of measures to optimally protect the right ventricle from injury during the perioperative period. Recognizing that the integrity of the right ventricle can be altered by numerous preoperative, perioperative and postoperative factors will provide an enlightened disposition on the part of the surgical team. Awareness of these considerations in the planning and conduct of surgical procedures should reduce morbidity and mortality from perioperative right ventricular failure. The imposition of new or unexpected morbidity during operation on a relatively unrelated problem represents surgical imperfection. Appropriate effort toward minimizing insult of the right ventricle could result in significantly decreasing the incidence and severity of perioperative right ventricular failure before the impetus of the continuing clinical problem dictates improvement in techniques to more appropriately treat this frequently preventable problem.

input: Abstract: When right ventricular failure prohibits separation from cardiopulmonary bypass, standard methods of increasing pulmonary blood flow should be employed, including correction of hypoxia and acidosis, volume loading, and inotropic support of the right ventricle. Infusion of pulmonary vasodilators--particularly low-dose nitroprusside--should be used if the pulmonary vascular resistance is elevated. If pulmonary blood flow remains unsatisfactory, systemic intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation should be employed. In refractory cases, right-atrial-to-pulmonary-artery bypass using the Bio-Medicus centrifugal pump is the recommended therapy for those centers that do not have the Pierce-Donachy pneumatic ventricular assist-pump available. For refractory right ventricular failure following the surgical repair of congenital cardiac defects in which the placement of right atrial and pulmonary artery cannulae is not technically feasible, use of high-frequency high-volume ventilation appears to be quite promising. Utilization of pulmonary artery counterpulsation or the creation of an atrial septal defect may also be lifesaving, but is not recommended as the therapy of choice.

input: Abstract: RV and LV failure frequently coexist. Experimental evidence suggests that RV failure results from a primary insult to the right ventricle and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. LV failure results in an elevation of the left atrial pressure and thereby a reduction in the transpulmonary hydrostatic gradient. Because RV function depends on the contraction of the left ventricle, this contribution is reduced during LV failure. Treatment should be aimed first at restoring LV function. If RV failure persists and is not due to a simple mechanical problem, treatment of RV failure should be commenced. If volume loading, inotropes, and pH adjustments do not result in adequate RV output, a mechanical assist device should be considered. RHBP is the most powerful device, and it is capable of restoring systemic perfusion even when there is no residual RV function. Clinical results with this device have been most encouraging--most patients demonstrate improved RV function and a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance after several days of treatment, allowing them to be weaned from assist. However, this technique is very invasive and requires constant close attention. PABC is a simple but less powerful assist device. Experimental studies suggest that if RV function is not extremely depressed--cardiac output is greater than 50 percent of normal--PABC may be effective in restoring systemic perfusion to normal levels. Current results suggest that RHBP remains the gold standard for severe RV failure, but further clinical experience with PABC may more clearly define its role in the management of RV failure.

input: Abstract: We used Doppler echocardiography to quantitate the changes in intracardiac blood flow velocities and right and left ventricular stroke volumes in 80 normal human fetuses from 19 to 40 weeks gestation. Blood flow velocity spectra across the aortic, pulmonary, tricuspid, and mitral valves were digitized to obtain peak velocities (m/sec) and flow velocity integrals. Aortic and pulmonary diameters were measured at valve level from two-dimensional echocardiographic images and cross-sectional area was calculated assuming a circular orifice. Ventricular stroke volume was calculated as the product of the cross-sectional area of a great vessel and the flow velocity integral through that vessel. The pulmonary arterial and aortic diameters increased linearly with gestational age (r = .82, r = .84), and pulmonary arterial diameter consistently exceeded aortic diameter. There was a positive relationship between stroke volume and gestational age: stroke volume increased exponentially from 0.7 ml at 20 weeks to 7.6 ml at 40 weeks for the right ventricle (r = .87) and from 0.7 ml at 20 weeks to 5.2 ml at 40 weeks for the left ventricle (r = .91). Similar results were obtained for right and left ventricular and combined cardiac outputs. In 44% of the fetuses it was possible to quantitate both right and left ventricular stroke volumes. There was a close correlation between right and left ventricular stroke volumes in these fetuses (r = .96) and right ventricular stroke volume exceeded left ventricular stroke volume by 28%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Black boys had significantly higher levels of estradiol, HDL cholesterol, and apo A-I, and lower levels of androstenedione and VLDL cholesterol than white boys, independent of age and adiposity. Age was correlated strongly with testosterone and androstenedione, and moderately with DHEA-S and estradiol levels in both races. However, only in white boys was age consistently related to VLDL cholesterol (positively), HDL cholesterol (negatively), and apo A-I (negatively). Overall, testosterone was associated inversely with HDL cholesterol and apo A-I in white boys, while progesterone was related positively to apo A-I in both races after adjusting for age and adiposity. However, these relationships were found to differ with age. Partial correlations between levels of sex hormones and lipoproteins adjusted for age and adiposity showed no associations in the 11 to 12 year age group in boys of either race.

input: Abstract: To assess the best method of quantitating progression of coronary disease, we studied four measurements in 114 coronary segments from 35 medically treated patients from whom angiograms were obtained 5 years apart. Only stenoses of less than 70% that were visualized in nearly identical projections on both angiograms were evaluated. Vessel edges were measured by use of catheter calibration and an automated computer algorithm yielding two ""absolute dimensions"" (mean and minimum diameters) and two measurements (percent stenosis and atheroma area) that required a ""normal reference"" diameter. The coefficient of variation for repeated segment measurements was less for mean and minimum diameter than for percent stenosis and area of atheroma. The best measure of progression of coronary disease as determined by t test comparison of different methods was the change in mean diameter over time (6.7 +/- 14.1% decrease), whether calculated on a per coronary segment or per patient basis (p less than .001). Based on this measurement and its standard deviation of progression of coronary disease in this patient subset with relatively benign disease, it is estimated that 470 patients per group would be required for an interventional study to demonstrate a 33% reduction in disease progression (207 patients for 50% reduction) at a 95% confidence level and 90% power.

Among all positive results, ischemic thresholds at night were significantly lower than those in the morning and in the afternoon (125 +/- 3 vs 138 +/- 3 and 139 +/- 2 beats/min, mean +/- SEM; p less than .005). In nine patients, 19 pacing tests produced ST segment elevation, of which 13 were performed at night (68%). We conclude that patients with resting angina and severe coronary stenosis often exhibit a nocturnal decline in their ischemic threshold, which seems to facilitate development of transmural ischemia during atrial pacing.

The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.

input: Abstract: It has been shown in different groups of patients with variant angina that coronary spasm can be reproduced by physiologic maneuvers and pharmacologic agents. It is not known, however, to what extent different stimuli can induce spasm in the same patient. To investigate whether coronary arterial spasm results from specific abnormal agonist-receptor interactions or from a local nonspecific coronary supersensitivity to different stimuli, 28 patients with vasospastic angina were submitted to a series of diverse vasoconstrictive stimuli known to provoke coronary spasm. Ergonovine, hyperventilation, handgrip, cold pressor, and exercise-tests, were carried out in all 28 patients. In the last 15 patients histamine was also administered. Spasm was provoked by ergonovine in 96% of patients, by hyperventilation in 54%, by histamine in 47%, by exercise in 46%, and by the cold pressor and handgrip tests in 11% and 7%, respectively. No significant differences were found in the responses to provocative tests of patients with normal coronary arteries or nonsignificant stenoses and those with significant lesions. In the same individual, spasm was induced by at least two vasoconstrictive stimuli, although with a different mechanism of action, in 82% of patients and spasm was induced by three or more stimuli in 39%. Tests were repeated in at least 23 patients and short-term reproducibility paralleled sensitivity. These results suggest that in patients with variant angina, a local nonspecific supersensitivity rather than an abnormal specific agonist-receptor interaction plays a major role in the genesis of coronary arterial spasm.

input: Abstract: The risk of developing spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (VT) and/or sudden death (""arrhythmic events"") was prospectively assessed in 165 patients who survived acute myocardial infarction. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms (ECGs) were performed before hospital discharge and then serially at regular intervals over the following year. In addition, 24 hr Holter monitoring was performed and left ventricular ejection fraction was determined. Sixty-five patients (group 1) had abnormal signal-averaged ECGs (voltage in the last 40 msec of the filtered QRS less than 20 microV or filtered QRS duration greater than 120 msec), 92 had normal signal-averaged ECGs (group 2), and eight had bundle branch block (excluded from analysis). In group 1, spontaneous normalization of the voltage in the last 40 msec of the QRS complex occurred in 30% of patients after 12 months, although total filtered QRS duration did not change overall. During follow-up of up to 20 months (median 11), seven patients died suddenly and six presented again with spontaneous, symptomatic VT. Eleven of 65 (17%) group 1 patients had an arrhythmic event compared with one of 92 patients (1%) in group 2 (p less than .001). The sensitivity of the signal-averaged ECG as a predictor of arrhythmic events was 92% with a specificity of 62%. Patients with subsequent arrhythmic events had considerably lower voltage in the last 40 msec of the QRS (11.0 +/- 8.3 vs 32.0 +/- 21.9 microV; p less than .001) than those without such events, and longer filtered QRS complexes (121 +/- 14 vs 105 +/- 12 msec; p less than .001). Multivariate logistic regression determined that the signal-averaged ECG provided independent prognostic information from the presence of complex ventricular ectopy and the degree of left ventricular dysfunction assessed at the time of hospital discharge. Signal-averaged ECGs provide important prognostic information in identifying patients at risk of arrhythmic events after myocardial infarction. Dynamic changes in the terminal QRS voltage are observed during the first year after myocardial infarction.

input: Abstract: We developed methods for identifying beta-adrenergic receptors in human right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy tissue with the radioligand (-)[125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP). Specific ICYP binding in a crude, high-yield membrane preparation derived from endomyocardial biopsy tissue was high (specificity greater than 90%), of high affinity (KD around 20 pM), saturable and stereospecific for the (-) vs the (+) isomer of isoproterenol. Subjects with mild-moderate and severe biventricular dysfunction had respective decreases in beta-adrenergic receptor density of 38.2% and 57.7% when normalization methods were averaged, with no significant differences in ICYP dissociation constant. A subgroup of subjects was subdivided by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) into those with mild cardiac dysfunction (LVEF less than 0.50 greater than 0.40) and severe heart failure (LVEF less than 0.20) and given graded sequential infusions of dobutamine and calcium gluconate. Those with severe cardiac dysfunction had marked impairment of the dobutamine dP/dt and stroke work index response, whereas these responses to calcium did not differ in the two groups. These data indicate that in the intact human heart endomyocardial biopsy may be used for direct analysis of beta-adrenergic receptors, heart failure-associated myocardial beta-adrenergic down-regulation begins with mild-moderate ventricular dysfunction, reduction in myocardial beta-receptor density is related to degree of heart failure, and beta-receptor down-regulation is associated with pharmacologically specific impairment of the beta-agonist-mediated contractile response.

input: Abstract: Therapy of elevated ventricular filling pressures in patients with dilated heart failure may be limited by concern that cardiac output will be further compromised. Twenty-five patients with severe symptoms and ejection fractions of 25% or less were studied to determine the lowest ventricular filling pressures that could be achieved with vasodilator and diuretic therapy while maintaining cardiac output. In 20 of 25 patients normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (PCWs) were achieved (mean 10 mm Hg compared with 30 mm Hg at baseline). Stroke volume was 60 vs 39 ml at baseline. Stroke work index was 30 vs 19 g-m/m2. For each patient, over the range of PCWs, stroke volume and stroke work index were maintained and were often maximal at the lowest PCW achieved. The upright position was well tolerated in patients with normal supine PCW. Normal filling pressures can be achieved in patients with congestive heart failure without compromise of cardiac output. While congestive symptoms should be improved, the feasibility and benefit of maintaining normal filling pressures over a long term must be established.

input: Abstract: The afterload-corrected end-systolic volume index (ratio of end-systolic stress to end-systolic volume index [ESS/ESVI]) was previously useful in predicting outcome in patients with mitral regurgitation undergoing valve replacement. Therefore we tested ESS/ESVI together with standard hemodynamic variables as possible predictors of outcome in 39 patients with various valvular lesions who underwent valve replacement. Thirteen patients had preoperative mitral regurgitation, 16 had aortic stenosis, nine had aortic regurgitation, and one had mitral stenosis. Twenty-seven patients (group S) had a satisfactory outcome as defined by a return to NYHA class I or II together with a normal postoperative ejection fraction. Twelve patients who died, remained in class III or IV, or had a subnormal postoperative ejection fraction were deemed to have an unsatisfactory result (group U). Mean right atrial pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, end-diastolic volume index, end-systolic volume index (ESVI), and end-systolic wall stress were all greater in group U, whereas ESS/ESVI and ejection fraction were lower in group U. When these and other factors were submitted to stepwise discriminant multivariate analysis, ESS/ESVI and ESVI were the only independent predictors of outcome. However, when patients with mitral regurgitation (who might have biased the study) were excluded, discriminant analysis showed ESVI as the only independent predictive variable. We conclude that end-systolic indicators of ventricular function are superior to other standard hemodynamic variables in predicting outcome of valve replacement.

input: Abstract: Combined two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography has a high sensitivity and specificity for detection of isolated perimembranous ventricular septal defects. However, muscular or multiple ventricular septal defects may be difficult to diagnose with noninvasive methods, particularly in older children, necessitating angiography for accurate diagnosis. Detection of single and multiple ventricular septal defects with two-dimensional color flow mapping was compared with detection by standard two-dimensional imaging and Doppler. Both techniques were compared with four-chamber left ventricular angiography. Fifty-one patients (age 3 months to 25 years, mean 5.6 years) were studied. Eighteen had solitary ventricular septal defects, 18 had multiple ventricular septal defects, and 15 patients with intact ventricular septum served as a control group. At least one ventricular septal defect was detected by color Doppler and two-dimensional/Doppler methods in all patients with ventricular septal defect proved by angiography with no false positives. In the detection of multiple ventricular septal defects, the sensitivity of color Doppler was 72% and that of two-dimensional/Doppler was 38% (100% specificity in both). Color Doppler failed to identify multiple ventricular septal defects in five patients (two weighing less than 4 kg and three with reduced pulmonary blood flow). However, no large additional muscular defects were missed by imaging and color Doppler. Color Doppler is useful for the detection of ventricular septal defects and has higher sensitivity than two-dimensional/Doppler for multiple ventricular septal defects. The contribution of color Doppler appears to be in the detection of additional small muscular ventricular septal defects.

input: Abstract: Low-level activity at the end of the QRS complex was analyzed from 63 thoracic leads in 15 normal subjects and in 21 patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT). The latter had old myocardial infarction and no conduction disturbances and had not been receiving antiarrhythmic drugs. In both normal subjects and patients with VT, isopotential maps of the time-averaged and filtered (25 Hz high-pass) electrocardiograms during the terminal portion of the QRS were dipolar, i.e., they showed single positive and negative regions. For patients with VT, the extrema were either distant, with one over the precordial area and the other over the back, or close together in the precordial region. In 10 patients, maps recorded after administration of antiarrhythmic drugs remained the same while QRS duration was prolonged. In six patients, maps recorded before antiarrhythmic surgery showed distant extrema for septal or posterobasal VT sites of origin and close extrema for anterior or posteroapical sites. Generally, QRS duration was reduced and maps were modified after surgery. Late potentials can be well detected with only three orthogonal leads because their distributions are dipolar, but maps provide additional information about their distribution, which may be related to conduction delay sites and possibly to VT sites of origin. Sources near the torso surface would produce close extrema, whereas deeper sources would produce distant extrema.

input: Abstract: Body surface potential maps were recorded from 140 chest leads in 25 patients affected by the idiopathic long QT syndrome (LQTS) and in 25 healthy control subjects matched for age and sex. Potential time integrals of the QRST and ST-T intervals were calculated at each lead point and displayed as isointegral (ISOI) maps. The main abnormalities noted on the QRST and ST-T ISOI maps were one area of negative values larger than normal in the right anterior and inferior thorax and a complex multipeak distribution of the integral values. At least one abnormality was present in 19 (76%) of the patients with LQTS and four (16%) of the control subjects (p less than .001). Each ISOI map was also represented as a weighted sum of nine fundamental components (eigenvectors) to detect and quantitate the nondipolar content. The percent contribution of the nondipolar eigenvectors (all eigenvectors beyond the third) was significantly higher in the LQTS group than in the control group (p less than .005). Specifically, an abnormally high nondipolar content on the QRST ISOI maps was observed much more frequently for patients with LQTS than for control subjects (nine or 36% vs one or 4%), and this was also true on the ST-T ISOI maps (14 or 56% vs one or 4%). No correlation was found between the major abnormalities on body surface maps and syncopal episodes. However, the high prevalence (76%) of these alterations among the patients with LQTS and their infrequent occurrence in the control population strongly suggests that they may be useful markers for the diagnosis of atypical cases. The prominent electronegative area on the anterior thorax can be related to delayed repolarization of a portion of the anterior wall of the heart. This finding is in agreement with the hypothesis that lower than normal right cardiac sympathetic activity is the main pathogenetic mechanism of LQTS. Multipeak distribution and high nondipolar content suggest regional electrical disparities in the ventricular recovery process. This may in part account for the high susceptibility of patients with LQTS to malignant arrhythmias.

input: Abstract: Guiding surgical therapy of ventricular tachycardia by preoperative endocardial catheter mapping necessitates improvement of the accuracy of localization of the arrhythmogenic site. We therefore used a new mathematical cineradiographic method during catheter mapping to compute the position of left ventricular arrhythmogenic sites relative to three anatomic reference points: the centers of aortic and mitral valve ostia and the left ventricular apex. To enable the surgeon to identify the position of the computed sites, a wire skeleton (one for each patient) representing a single or multiple arrhythmogenic site(s) relative to the anatomic reference points was constructed. This wire skeleton was inserted into the left ventricular cavity during surgery. Side branches of the device indicated preoperatively localized arrhythmogenic sites. Results in eight consecutive patients were compared with those of intraoperative simultaneous mapping of 64 endocardial sites. Sixteen morphologically distinct monomorphic ventricular tachycardias were mapped by catheter and 15 by intraoperative mapping. In 12 ventricular tachycardias an identical morphology was recorded during both techniques. The distance between arrhythmogenic sites localized with both methods was 1 cm or less in 11 of these 12 ventricular tachycardias and 2 cm in one ventricular tachycardia. These results indicate that endocardial catheter mapping combined with wire skeleton representation of computed positions of arrhythmogenic sites is reliable for guiding surgical therapy of ventricular tachycardia and since some of the ventricular tachycardias were inducible only during either preoperative or intraoperative mapping, both techniques have an additive value. In addition, the wire skeleton proved convenient during surgery by identifying the arrhythmogenic sites.

input: Abstract: The short-term effects of incremental doses of procainamide (7.5, 15, 22.5, and 30 mg/kg) on right ventricular effective refractory period, intraventricular conduction, and induction of ventricular tachycardia were determined in 31 patients who had a history of sustained, unimorphic ventricular tachycardia. QRS duration during incremental ventricular pacing was used as an index of rate-dependent changes in intraventricular conduction. The mean plasma procainamide concentrations corresponding to the incremental doses were 5.5 +/- 1.2 (+/- SD), 9.0 +/- 1.6, 12.6 +/- 2.2, and 16.3 +/- 3.2 mg/liter. Each incremental dose of procainamide up to a dose of 30 mg/kg resulted in a significant increment in right ventricular effective refractory period and each dose up to 22.5 mg/kg potentiated a rate-dependent prolongation of QRS duration. After the 7.5 mg/kg dose of procainamide, induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed in eight of 31 patients. After higher doses of procainamide, induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed in two additional patients. In three of 10 patients in whom the induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed by 7.5, 15, or 22.5 mg/kg of procainamide, sustained unimorphic ventricular tachycardia was again inducible after a higher dose of procainamide. In three of 31 patients, only nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was inducible after a 7.5 to 22.5 mg/kg dose of procainamide; however, in two of these three patients, sustained ventricular tachycardia was again inducible after administration of a higher dose of procainamide. In conclusion, during electropharmacologic testing with procainamide, it is worthwhile to test a dose of 7.5 mg/kg, because this dose is often effective in patients who respond to this drug. However, the results of this study indicate that procainamide may be effective in suppressing the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia at a relatively low plasma concentration, but not at a higher plasma concentration. Therefore, during long-term therapy with procainamide it may be important to avoid plasma procainamide concentrations not only lower, but also higher than the concentration that results in the suppression of induction of tachycardia.

input: Abstract: Some patients converted from ventricular fibrillation to organized rhythms by defibrillation-trained ambulance technicians (EMT-Ds) will refibrillate before hospital arrival. The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.

input: Abstract: Coronary angioplasty was performed in 53 patients in whom unstable angina had reoccurred after 48 hr and within 30 days after sustained myocardial infarction. Single-vessel disease was present in 64% of the patients and multivessel disease in 36%. The preceding myocardial infarction had been small to moderate in size in the majority of the patients. The left ventricular ejection fraction was more than 50% in 80% of the patients. Forty-five patients were refractory to pharmacologic treatment; eight were initially stabilized but once again became symptomatic with light exertion. Angioplasty was performed in 35 patients 2 to 14 days and in 18 patients 15 to 30 days after infarction (average 12 +/- 7 days after infarction). The initial success rate was 89% (47/53). The success rate of the patients treated at 2 to 14 days was lower (29/35, 83%) than that of patients treated at 14 to 30 days (18/18, 100%) but did not reach statistical significance (p less than .06). There were no deaths related to the procedure. In four of the six failures, emergency bypass surgery was performed and two patients sustained a myocardial infarction. Furthermore, a myocardial infarction complicated the angioplasty procedure in two other patients; thus the overall procedure-related myocardial infarction rate was 8% (4/53). At 6 months follow-up 26% (14/53) of all the patients who underwent angioplasty had recurrence of angina, which was successfully treated with repeat angioplasty, bypass surgery, or medical therapy. There were no late deaths. Late myocardial infarction occurred in two patients. Thus the total myocardial infarction rate after angioplasty at 6 months was 11% (6/53 patients).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

input: Abstract: Coronary dissection and total coronary occlusion leading to emergency coronary surgery are the most frequent complications of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and their occurrence usually is unpredictable. To identify angiographic characteristics of coronary stenoses that may affect the incidence of these complications, the diagnostic pre-PTCA coronary angiograms of 38 consecutive patients (group I) undergoing emergency coronary surgery for dissection or occlusion were reviewed and compared with the angiograms of a random sample of 38 patients (stratified for left anterior descending and right coronary arteries) from a group of 1151 who did not need emergency coronary surgery (group II). Stenosis morphology before angioplasty was considered ""complicated"" if at least one of the following criteria was present: irregular borders, intraluminal lucency, and localization of stenosis in curve or at bifurcation. Baseline characteristics, maximum inflation pressures, types of balloon catheters used, and routinely registered angiographic stenosis properties (severity, length, eccentricity, and calcification) were similar in both groups. Irregular borders before PTCA were present in 22 of 38 patients in group I vs 10 of 38 in group II (p less than .05), intraluminal lucency in 22 of 38 vs nine of 38 (p less than .05), localization in curve in 27 of 38 pts vs 16 of 38 (p less than .05), and localization at bifurcation in 11 of 38 vs 15 of 38 (NS). Complicated angiographic morphology of coronary stenosis may represent a risk factor for dissection or occlusion. Therefore, although the predictive value of these findings is low, detailed evaluation of angiographic morphology of coronary stenoses may improve patient selection and reduce complication rates of PTCA.

input: Abstract: The effect of thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction on enzymatic infarct size, left ventricular function, and early mortality was studied in subsets of patients in a randomized trial. Early thrombolytic therapy with intracoronary streptokinase (152 patients) or with intracoronary streptokinase preceded by intravenous streptokinase (117 patients) was compared with conventional treatment (264 patients). All 533 patients were admitted to the coronary care unit within 4 hr after onset of symptoms indicative of acute myocardial infarction. Four hundred eighty-eight patients were eligible for this detailed analysis, and 245 of these were allocated to thrombolytic therapy and 243 to conventional treatment. Early angiographic examinations were performed in 212 patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy. Patency of the infarct-related artery was achieved in 181 patients (85%). Enzymatic infarct size, as measured from cumulative alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase release, was smaller in patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy (median 760 vs 1170 U/liter in control patients, p = .0001). Left ventricular ejection fraction measured by radionuclide angiography before discharge from the hospital was higher after thrombolytic therapy (median 50% vs 43% in control patients, p = .0001). Three month mortality was lower in patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy (6% vs 14% in the control group, p = .006). With the use of multivariate regression analysis, infarct size limitation, improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction, and three month mortality were predicted by sum of the ST segment elevation, time from onset of symptoms to admission, and Killip class at admission. Thrombolysis was most effective in patients admitted within 2 hr after onset of symptoms and in patients with a sum of ST segment elevation of 1.2 mV or more. On the other hand, no beneficial effects of streptokinase on enzymatic infarct size, left ventricular function, or mortality were observed in the subset of patients with a sum of ST segment elevation of less than 1.2 mV who were admitted between 2 and 4 hr after onset of symptoms.

input: Abstract: Myocardial and cerebral blood flow can be generated during cardiac arrest by techniques that manipulate intrathoracic pressure. Augmentation of intrathoracic pressure by high-pressure ventilation simultaneous with compression of the chest in dogs has been shown to produce higher flows to the heart and brain, but has limited usefulness because of the requirement for endotracheal intubation and complex devices. A system was developed that can produce high intrathoracic pressure without simultaneous ventilation by use of a pneumatically cycled vest placed around the thorax (vest cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR]). The system was first tested in a short-term study of the maximum achievable flows during arrest. Peak vest pressures up to 380 mm Hg were used on eight 21 to 30 kg dogs after induction of ventricular fibrillation and administration of epinephrine. Microsphere-determined myocardial blood flow was 108 +/- 17 ml/min/100 g (100 +/- 16% of prearrest flow) and cerebral flow was 51 +/- 12 ml/min/100 g (165 +/- 39% of prearrest). Severe lung or liver trauma was noted in three of eight dogs. If peak vest pressure was limited to 280 mm Hg, however, severe trauma was no longer observed. A study of the hemodynamics during and survival from prolonged resuscitation was then performed on three groups of seven dogs. Vest CPR was compared with manual CPR with either conventional (300 newtons) or high (430 newtons) sternal force. After induction of ventricular fibrillation, each technique was performed for 26 min. Defibrillation was then performed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

input: Abstract: Radiographic techniques used to quantify coronary blood flow all require bolus injection of contrast material, which markedly alters the flow being measured. Newer nonionic contrast agents have been shown to have fewer adverse hemodynamic, inotropic, and rheologic effects compared with ionic media and it has been suggested that they might not substantially affect coronary blood flow. Six dogs were instrumented with electromagnetic flow probes and subendocardial ultrasonic crystals. Intracoronary injections of iohexol (300 mg/ml iodine) were administered to establish a relationship between the dose and rate of contrast injection and the effect on flow and regional myocardial function. Two and 4 ml volumes of iohexol were injected at 3 ml/sec; 4 ml volumes were administered at 1 and 4 ml/sec. The 2 and 4 ml volumes decreased coronary flow by a mean of 31% (p less than .01) and 77% (p less than .001). The 4 ml injection at 1 and 4 ml/sec 77% (p less than .001) and 69% (p less than .001). The magnitude of the fall in flow was directly related to the dose, and the rate at which the flow nadir was attained was directly related to the rate of injection. Decrements in fractional shortening were temporally delayed by several beats compared with the flow changes and showed mean decrements of 19% to 29%. The effects on regional myocardial function were independent of contrast volume. However, the degree of dysfunction was more profound with slower infusion rates, suggesting that prolongation of contrast-induced ischemia was a major modulating factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

input: Abstract: To determine the importance of reperfusion injury and the ability of the free-radical scavenger recombinant human superoxide dismutase (h-SOD) to prevent it, open-chest dogs underwent 90 min of proximal circumflex coronary artery occlusion, and only at the moment of reperfusion received either h-SOD (400,000 IU bolus into the left atrium followed by a 300,000 IU iv infusion over 1 hr) or saline. After 48 hr the surviving animals were killed and measurements were made of the risk region (by postmortem angiography) and infarct size (by gross pathology). All measurements were made by investigators blinded to treatment given, and the code was broken only at the end of the study. Hemodynamic variables and collateral flow during ischemia were similar in the two groups. Infarct size in control animals (n = 8) averaged 22.4 +/- 3.1% of the left ventricle and 52.2 +/- 7.1% of the risk region, compared with 13.3 +/- 0.8% of the left ventricle and 33.6 +/- 2.1% of the risk region in h-SOD-treated dogs (n = 8) (p less than .05). Infarcts in treated animals were not only smaller, but also exhibited a distinctive ""patchiness,"" suggesting protection along vascular distributions. Furthermore, analysis of the relationship between infarct size and collateral flow measured during ischemia in the two groups indicated that protection by h-SOD was greatest in animals with the lowest collateral flows. This study supports the concept that reperfusion of ischemic myocardium results in a separate component of cell damage, presumably linked to the generation of oxygen free radicals on reflow. Since the h-SOD preventable reperfusion component of injury was most pronounced in hearts with the most severe ischemia, scavenging of oxygen radicals at the time of reflow may offer a novel and particularly promising therapeutic approach for the protection of ischemic myocardium.

Twenty-two dogs underwent occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). In 10 dogs (group I) the LAD remained occluded for 3 hr and in the other 12 (group II) for 2 hr followed by 1 hr of reperfusion. Gd-DTPA (0.34 mM/kg) was administered to five dogs in group I at 2 hr and 5 min after occlusion and to seven dogs in group II 5 min after reperfusion. At 3 hr after ligation, the hearts were excised and imaged with spin echo and inversion recovery pulse sequences on a 0.35 Tesla magnetic resonance imager. Reperfused hearts given Gd-DTPA demonstrated a significant increase in contrast between normal and reperfused myocardium as compared with nonreperfused hearts and reperfused hearts not given Gd-DTPA. This enhancement was particularly prominent in the inversion recovery images. Studies performed in vivo in two additional dogs demonstrated similar enhancement with reperfusion with Gd-DTPA in gated spin echo images. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging allows the detection of reperfusion early in the course of acute infarction.

input: Abstract: The outcome from cardiopulmonary arrest in children in the prehospital and hospital setting is generally poor. The event that compromises the cardiac status is often respiratory embarrassment, and the presenting rhythms are often bradyarrhythmias and asystole. Emergency medical services (EMS) systems have primarily an adult focus and may not be organized to manage optimally the critically ill and injured child. Data from a survey of training programs demonstrate that paramedic and EMT education in pediatric emergencies may be inadequate. Forty-one percent of the programs surveyed had less than 10 hr of pediatric training. Data suggest that EMS providers may not be equipped to manage children effectively. The Los Angeles EMS System for children is described. There are two levels of receiving facilities: Emergency Departments Approved for Pediatrics and Pediatric Critical Care Centers. The system is voluntary and has 85% of the hospitals in compliance with the guidelines. Early recognition of the prearrest state, improved training, and equipping of prehospital care personnel, development of EMS services for children, dissemination of an advanced pediatric life support course, as well as research in pediatric CPR may improve the outcome of resuscitation in the pediatric population.

input: Abstract: Defibrillation by minimally trained ambulance technicians can significantly improve survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in communities of all sizes. However, special consideration must be given to the development of such services in small communities, chiefly because of problems associated with the low volume of true emergency calls. Communities considering implementing programs by which defibrillation is performed by the emergency medical technician (EMT-D) must first evaluate their ambulance response times and, if inadequate, alter their system of ambulance response. After implementation of such a program, a permanent, formal skill maintenance program must be established. Defibrillation protocols must allow for the fact that many patients will refibrillate after successful conversion, yet no advanced care beyond the defibrillator will generally be available. Finally, every community instituting an EMT-D program must maintain a system of monitoring EMT performance and patient outcome that documents acceptable survival-to-discharge rates as well as the safety of the program. For smaller communities a regional or statewide evaluation system may be preferable to individual community programs.

Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.

input: Abstract: To increase the survival rate for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, improvements in training must be made so that lay rescuers are motivated and have the ability to get involved. To overcome some of the fear and lack of involvement, better education strategies are needed. Adults learn didactic information through understanding and skills through repetition and reinforcement. Due to the fact that there is limited time that adults will commit to learning CPR, methods of simplification of the techniques need to be used so that there can be sufficient repetition and reinforcement. Teaching two-rescuer CPR to lay rescuers should not routinely be done. Most adults, particularly those around high-risk individuals, should learn one-rescuer CPR. Infant resuscitation should be taught predominantly to those around small children. Methods of reinforcement through the mass media should be attempted on a routine basis. Whenever possible the courses should be spread over a period of time to allow for repetition and reinforcement, thereby maximizing learning. Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) should be widely taught to health professionals. ACLS instruction needs to be spread over time, whenever logistically possible, to enhance learning and retention. Good, validated examinations are needed and should be routinely rotated. Better methods of evaluation are needed to look at the benefit of these types of programs and to improve the cost-benefit ratio.

Regardless of the cause, mechanical ventilation should begin as soon as possible and closed-chest cardiac massage should be administered when there is any question about the adequacy of cardiac output. After aspiration of either fresh or seawater, a large intrapulmonary physiologic shunt can occur, which requires aggressive mechanical ventilatory support to ensure adequate oxygenation and to return pulmonary function to normal. Near drowning is a multisystem disease and, while abnormalities of the lung and brain have been emphasized, definitive therapy must be tailored to each patient and must address all of the patient's needs.

input: Abstract: The ability of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to provide adequate vital organ blood flow during prolonged resuscitation has long been questioned, as has the mechanism of blood flow during CPR. Because coughing during cardiac arrest has been shown to produce adequate anterograde flow to maintain consciousness in man without compressing the heart, cough CPR has been used as a model of a pure ""thoracic pump"" mechanism on which to base modifications of CPR. In the thoracic pump mechanism, the left heart is a passive conduit for blood expressed from the pulmonary vasculature to the aorta, and there is selective flow to the brachiocephalic vascular bed because of its low pressure veins, which are protected by closure of thoracic inlet venous valves. Right heart flow from systemic veins to the lungs occurs between applications of pressure. Four alternative modalities exploiting the thoracic pump concept were studied in dogs during ventricular fibrillation with angiographic and pressure recordings: cough CPR, simultaneous chest compression and lung inflation, abdominal compression with lung inflation, and inflation of a vest and binder. The latter technique was associated with successful defibrillation and recovery after more than 30 min of circulatory support during ventricular fibrillation. Preliminary studies in a primate preparation indicate that this technique might be useful for prolonged circulatory support in man when defibrillation is not initially available or successful.

input: Abstract: Considerable effort has been expended in recent years by a number of laboratories to improve methods of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This article briefly summarizes 5 years of investigation by our group on hemodynamic support during external cardiac massage. In most studies, long-term canine preparations were used, and implanted transducers allowed precise hemodynamic measurements. Although cardiac output was depressed with all CPR methods, manual chest compressions of high velocity, moderate force, and brief duration at a rate of 120/min seemed to optimize systemic and coronary blood flow. This method was termed high-impulse CPR. High-impulse techniques now have been applied extensively in the clinical setting, and preliminary observations also support their efficacy in man. Based on this experience, it is suggested that the American Heart Association guidelines be changed to recommend a manual chest compression rate of 120/min during closed-chest cardiac massage.

input: Abstract: Management of foreign body airway obstruction continues to be a major controversy in emergency medical care. Much of the disagreement is without doubt based on lack of a uniformly accepted model of acute airway obstruction representative of the clinical event. A variety of models have been used to assess different aspects of airway obstruction by foreign bodies. These models have analyzed, among other variables, kinetic energy and inertial and aerodynamic forces in attempts to focus on specific aspects of this controversy. Human volunteers, anesthetized and paralyzed patients, and cadavers have also been used. In several recent studies it was concluded that subdiaphragmatic pressure is the treatment of choice, while in at least one additional study firm back blows applied with the patient's head hanging downward were recommended as the treatment most likely to relieve airway obstruction. It seems likely that these apparently conflicting views can be reconciled and that a consensus recommendation for treatment of this emergency can be effected.

Recent data corroborate clinical studies performed in the 1950s and 1960s, suggesting a need to change the present American Heart Association standards for artificial ventilation. These studies show that gastric insufflation followed by regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration are a major hazard of artificial ventilation with an unprotected airway. Present BLS-CPR standards require that ventilation be performed rapidly between external chest compressions or with incremental breaths. These methods of ventilation predispose the victim to gastric insufflation. Alternative methods of ventilation with longer inspiratory time and thus lower flow rate and peak inspiratory pressure are suggested. Additionally, rescue personnel, particularly EMTs and paramedics, should be taught how to apply cricoid pressure to prevent gastric insufflation in victims with an unprotected airway.

input: Abstract: To determine the value of sodium bicarbonate in resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation and the prevention of spontaneous refibrillation, sodium bicarbonate (1 meq/kg) or placebo was administered on a random basis to 16 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs 18 min after the induction of ventricular fibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Defibrillation was attempted 2 min after the administration of bicarbonate or placebo. All animals were successfully defibrillated, but three of eight bicarbonate-treated and two of eight control animals died in electromechanical dissociation (p = NS). Spontaneous refibrillation occurred in three animals in each group (p = NS). Successful resuscitation was not dependent on treatment, arterial or mixed venous Pco2, or arterial or mixed venous pH but correlated strongly with coronary perfusion pressure (p less than .003). Spontaneous refibrillation occurred without relation to any identifiable variable. The gradient between diastolic aortic and right atrial pressures was 24 +/- 2 mm Hg in controls and 23 +/- 2 mm Hg in treated animals over the entire 20 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (p = NS). However, among animals successfully resuscitated, mean diastolic coronary perfusion pressure averaged 27 +/- 2 mm Hg compared with 20 +/- 1 mm Hg among those dying in electromechanical dissociation (p less than .02). For the final 2 min of resuscitation, after drug administration, these gradients were 31 +/- 2 and 23 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively (p less than .01). Microsphere determined myocardial perfusion correlated with the diastolic aortic-right atrial perfusion pressure gradient (r = .86) and was 0.43 +/- 0.03 ml/min/g in survivors and 0.22 +/- 0.01 ml/min/g in nonsurvivors (p less than .01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

input: Abstract: As a means of providing defibrillation as soon as possible for those suffering out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation, numerous communities have trained and authorized emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to provide defibrillatory shocks (EMT-D). The findings of four controlled studies and the experience of various communities have answered important questions. EMT-D programs have been shown effective in urban, suburban, and rural communities with and without paramedic backup. EMT-D programs appear safe, with errors of commission being extremely rare and errors of omission being of acceptably low incidence. Issues still to be resolved include the degree and amount of training that should be given and whether manual or automatic defibrillators should be used. Medical supervision and quality control is the most important aspect of EMT-D programs. At its core, the success of EMT-D programs is confirmation of the principle of early defibrillation. Wider dissemination of early defibrillation will improve survival from sudden cardiac death.

Different events were photographed by taking 'stills' from the television monitor during play-back. Outgrowths from both tumour and normal explants formed only as monolayers. Mitoses were mainly found to be localized approximately mid-way between explant and the edge of the outgrowth. Some cells were seen to become suddenly active producing oscillating blebs and sometimes they detached themselves from the monolayer culture and changed appearance. This was more prevalent in the tumour cultures. In both tumour and normal cell cultures lymphocytes were observed and their normal chemokinetic movement was changed into a rapid chemotactic attraction by the presence of a mitotic epithelial cell. These lymphocytes appear to represent T-suppressor cells. The present study has shown that primary tissue culture can be a valuable tool in the study of laryngeal carcinoma. The interaction between mitotic tumour cells and lymphocytes may represent a transformation of T-lymphocytes into LAK cells.

input: Abstract: Some patients converted from ventricular fibrillation to organized rhythms by defibrillation-trained ambulance technicians (EMT-Ds) will refibrillate before hospital arrival. The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.

input: Abstract: DNA measurements yield information about the nature of cells and may provide diagnostic and prognostic information. Static cytofluorometry was performed on smears removed at microlaryngoscopy from 107 vocal cord lesions (96 patients). All stem cell lines were diploid except 3; 2 carcinomas and 1 severe dysplasia were polyploid. The mean proliferative activity (percentage of nuclei greater than diploid peak) was 2.1% for the group of epithelia with hyperplasia and mild dysplasia, 3.1% for those with moderate dysplasia, 4.0% for severe dysplasia, and 6.8% for carcinomas. Hypertetraploid cell nuclei (HT cells) were not found in epithelia with hyperplasia and mild dysplasia. Seven out of 15 patients with epithelia showing moderate dysplasia had HT cells; 5 of these patients developed a carcinoma. One of 8 without HT cells developed a severe dysplasia. Nine patients with severe dysplasia had HT cells; 4 had recurrences and 4 developed carcinoma within 4 years. In 14 patients without HT cells, 3 had recurrences and 1 developed a carcinoma 6 years later. HT cells were found in 15 patients with T1 & T2 carcinomas; residual carcinoma was present in 2 after radiotherapy and 4 had recurrences within 11 months. Fourteen patients with T1 & T2 carcinoma did not have any HT cells; one had residual carcinoma after radiotherapy and 3 had recurrences between 18 months and 4 years. DNA measurements and, especially, the demonstration of epithelia with HT cells prove to be of prognostic importance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

One month after the operation, it was not possible to identify the original vessels. In other locations new varicose vessels began to appear after 1 month, and at the end of the follow-up period were observed on 9 out of 10 operated sides. The transection resulted in an immediate decrease in the frequency of nose bleeds and at the end of the control period 12 (55%) of the patients had had less than 4 bleeds during the previous year in spite of the observed rapid formation of new vessels. Mucosal atrophy with symptoms of increased nasal crusting occurred in 3 patients. Transection of varicose vessels in patients with nose bleeds leads to a decrease in the number of bleeds.

input: Abstract: The classical concept of the autonomic innervation of the nasal mucosa states that the postganglionic sympathetic neurones lie in the superior cervical ganglion and those of the postganglionic parasympathetic neurones are in the pterygopalatine ganglion. We have carried out a study of the fine structure of the respiratory nasal mucosa in man and in the cat using the techniques described by Jabonero, Champy Maillet and Koelle-Friedenwald. The most striking finding was the presence of microganglia deep within the mucosa of the inferior turbinate close to the glands. These microganglia were cholinergic in nature since they demonstrated a positive reaction to anticholinesterase. From this we deduce that the nasal parasympathetic pathway has its postganglionic neurones not only in the pterygopalatine ganglion but also in these microganglia of the inferior turbinate. Each of four groups of cats were submitted to different techniques, including administration of neostigmine, inferior turbinectomy and Vidian neurectomy. Resection of the microganglia by means of turbinectomy reduced the hypersecretion caused by neostigmine and this was most noticeable when a Vidian neurectomy was carried out in addition.

Twenty out of twenty healthy subjects had abundant triamterene crystals and casts in acid urine after receiving a single 100 mg dose. Casts were present in the urine from 2-11 hours after administration of the diuretic. Cast formation occurred in acidic urine and was prevented by alkalinization of the urine with potassium citrate. Animal studies showed that crystallization and cast formation occurred in the medullary and papillary collecting ducts of the rat kidney. These findings provide a possible explanation for the reported nephrotoxicity of triamterene, particularly when given to patients who are receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents.

The intraperitoneal heparin concentration decreased linearily from 1.78 U/ml to 1.13 U/ml during a 4-hour dwell time. The antithrombin III-concentration increased to 0.56 +/- 0.1 mg/dl, reaching 1.87% of normal plasma values. The antithrombin III-portion of total protein was 0.62% in plasma and 0.79% in dialysate. The fibrinopeptide A-concentration, a specific product of thrombin action on fibrinogen was 37.1 +/- 11.8 ng/ml in plasma (normal range: less than 2.5 ng/ml) and 153.4 +/- 16.8 ng/ml in dialysate during regular CAPD. After the addition of 5000 U heparin the fibrinopeptide A-concentration in dialysate decreased to 11.6 +/- 2.6 ng/ml during a 4-hour dwell time. In vitro experiments showed no remarkable inhibition of fibrin formation by heparin without antithrombin III in dialysate. We suggest that the fibrinopeptide A is produced intraperitoneally and the antithrombin III-concentration in dialysate is sufficient to inhibit the fibrin formation after acceleration by heparin.

All subjects had documented progression of deformity, with an average curvature of 34 degrees. The average ages for scoliotics and 18 control subjects were 16.1 and 20.8 years, respectively. Controls had no spinal deformity and underwent identical test procedures. The test results showed that scoliotic subjects had significant asymmetry between right and left limbs in their threshold for detection of joint motion (p less than or equal to 0.005) and in their ability to reproduce angles to which their elbow joint had been previously positioned (p less than or equal to 0.025). Slight asymmetry also was observed in the reproduction tests of the control group (p less than or equal to 0.013); however, there was no significant asymmetry seen in this group for the threshold test. Performance of bilateral limbs was designated good and bad for both groups; the limb that performed better in proprioceptive function was designated good limb. Analysis of data showed that the scoliotics' good and bad limbs performed inferiorly in both threshold and angle reproduction tests when compared with normal controls. The results of this study imply, but do not localize, a neurologic deficit in scoliotic patients.

It is a tapered V-shaped nail made of malleable stainless steel, which provides rigid fracture fixation. Torsional stress is resisted because of its triflanged shape. It may be introduced closed, using the image intensifier. Two groups of patients were evaluated: Group I was treated with the Inyo nail and Group II was treated by the Association For the Study of Internal Fixation (ASIF) technique. Eighty-five percent of the patients in Group I were rated as good, compared with 63% in Group II. There was significantly less morbidity and complications in Group I. Several factors must be observed in the treatment of ankle fractures. Stress radiographs must be obtained intraoperative. Surgery may be indicated in unstable supination lateral rotation Type II injuries, if these occur in patients with high physical demands. Anatomic reduction of the lateral malleolus must be obtained. Early weight-bearing and motion produces the best result. Late reconstruction of malunions can be accomplished using the Inyo nail.

Measurable migration and inducible displacement may be the rule rather than an exception in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Accordingly, absolute rigid fixation would not be necessary for successful function of a TKA.
output: ",Tibial component fixation in knee arthroplasty.

The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.

input: Abstract: The functional results of 28 cases of rupture of the quadriceps and patellar tendons are reported. Excellent or good results were noted in 15 of 18 quadriceps and 7 of 10 patellar tendons. Radiographic comparison with the opposite knee disclosed incongruences between the patella and the femoral groove in the tangential view and/or cranial-caudal position of the patella in the lateral view in 13 of the quadriceps tendon ruptures and seven of the patellar tendon ruptures. Patients with residual pain had patellofemoral incongruity but since two-thirds of the patients with incongruity were asymptomatic, incongruity alone may not be the cause of the symptoms. There was no positive correlation to muscular strength or range of movement. Nevertheless, exact adaptation of the patellar tendon and periarticular tissue seems necessary to obtain correct patello-femoral articulation. Reinforcement of the tendon with a wire cerclage is recommended to decrease the tension on the suture line and the consequent risk of a secondary rupture. In acute ruptures of the quadriceps tendon end-to-end sutures are sufficient.

Anatomic studies demonstrate the value of a modified surgical technique using a special drill guide for standardized positioning of the anterior cruciate substitute. The drill guide consists of a metal frame with one adjustable and one fixed guide tube. Drilling is done from the anteromedial aspect of the tibia, upwards, through the joint space and the femur in a straight line, both channels being drilled in a single procedure. The precision of guided drilling was superior to that of free-hand drilling in positioning the ligament in the correct anatomic place.

input: Abstract: The presence of patella alta has been linked to recurrent dislocation of the patella and the patello-femoral stress syndrome. It is not known whether patella alta is an inherited or acquired trait. To investigate the relationship of patella during the adolescent growth spurt, serial orthoroentgenograms (growth study films) were retrospectively analyzed in 19 patients. Two were found in whom proximal patella migration could be correlated (r = 0.85) with femoral growth rate. This was significant at the p = 0.01 level. Girls had a higher correlation of patella height to growth rate than boys. In certain cases, patella alta is an acquired rather than inherited condition; this supports the theory that overgrowth during the growth spurt can lead to patella alta in some individuals.

input: Abstract: In a consecutive series of patients with knee complaints, tibial rotation consistently affected the interpretation of the Lachman test (passive anterior tibial translation in slight knee flexion). To perform the Lachman test correctly, the anterior tibial force must be applied posteromedially on the proximal tibia. This is best achieved by having the leg under examination on the same side of the bed as the examiner, and with slight external tibial rotation. Reaching across the bed to examine either leg can create either false positive or false negative Lachman results due to inadvertent tibial rotation (internal tibial rotation decreases translation) and inaccurate comparisons of the injured and normal legs. The importance of tibial rotation must be recognized if the Lachman test is to be used reliably and with maximum sensitivity.

None had ischemic medial compartment syndrome. Physical examination could not differentiate between cases with medial tibial bone pain secondary to stress fractures and those with scintigraphically normal tibias. When both pain and swelling were localized in the middle one-third of the tibia, the lesion most likely proved to be a stress fracture.

input: Abstract: A technique for ipsilateral femoral neck and shaft fracture using the sliding compression hip screw with plate combined with trochanteric antegrade Ender nailing of the femur was applied in two cases. Ender nails can be passed without difficulty past a compression hip screw and the bicortical plating screws. The hip and femur can be fixed internally through a single approach in a single position. Sliding compression hip screw devices can provide excellent preliminary stable femoral neck fixation. Blood supply to the femoral head is not disturbed while the femoral intramedullary fixation is performed. Antegrade Ender nailing avoids the common knee complications associated with other retrograde techniques. Decreased operative time, less blood loss, less technical difficulty, and early mobilization are important factors in the multiple-injured patient. Femoral intramedullary fixation may require open reduction, circlerage to ensure stability, and maintenance of alignment in case of significant comminution to allow early crutch ambulation. This mode of fixation may be advantageous for selected cases.

input: Abstract: The authors present an in-depth clinical, radiographic, and pathologic analysis of a 62-year-old man with massive bone reabsorption around the proximal femur in a total hip arthroplasty (THA). The THA was revised 13 years after implantation. Thirty millimeters of calcar resorption was noted radiographically. Evidence of stem bending was present on examination of the femoral implant, and marked wear of the acetabular cup was noted. The pathologic evaluation of removed calcar bone and cement revealed a histiocytic mass invading the bone. Intracellular and extracellular polymethylene debris was noted within the invasive mass. Evidence of fragmented methylmethacrylate cement was also present. The bone-cement interface in the excised calcar region contained segments that showed active bone remodelling around the cement without an interposed membrane. It is possible that this case of calcar resorption began with histiocytic activation and recruitment by polyethylene wear debris followed by active bone lysis. The process may be perpetuated by the fragmentation of cement, as motion occurred at the calcar bone-cement interface, and may represent an extreme example of a process occurring in cases of calcar resorption in general.

input: Abstract: More than 90% of patients with so-called primary or idiopathic osteoarthritis of the hips in whom sufficient data were available to make an assessment of the normality of the hip joint at the cessation of growth clearly showed demonstrable abnormalities in the hip joint. The most common are mild acetabular dysplasia and/or pistol grip deformity. This latter deformity is associated with mild slipped capital femoral epiphysis (recognized or unrecognized at the time), Legg-Perthes' disease (recognized or unrecognized at the time), multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, and/or the presence of an intraacetabular labrum, as well as, in certain instances, acetabular dysplasia. When these abnormalities are taken in conjunction with the detection of other metabolic abnormalities that can lead to osteoarthritis of the hip and which may not be recognized readily, such as hemochromatosis, ochronosis, calcium pyrophosphate disease, and monarticular rheumatoid arthritis, it seems clear that either osteoarthritis of the hip does not exist at all as a primary disease entity or, if it does, is extraordinarily rare.

Rupture of the lateral collateral ligament allows the posterolateral calcaneal fragment to move laterally to lie immediately subjacent to the distal fibula. Closed reduction is impossible. Open reduction of this rare fracture dislocation is essential. A lateral approach to the calcaneus is generally sufficient, but a second medial incision may be required.

Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.

input: Abstract: Recognizing that not all patients with low back pain have lumbar disc disease, the authors began to inject facet joints in June 1982 and have experience now with 21 patients, each injected under fluoroscopic control with a mixture of local anesthetic and steroid. One technical problem occurred when large osteophytes blocked access to the facet joints. Otherwise, there were no complications and minimal morbidity. Most patients (15 of 20; 75%) had an initial response, but a much smaller number (six of 18 followed more than three months; 33%) had a lasting response. Repeat injections, when done, always led to temporary improvement but rarely to lasting relief (one of five; 20%). Three factors characterized the patients: a negative screening examination for other causes of back pain or sciatica; back pain with tenderness localized over one or more facet joints; and radiologic changes of degenerative joint disease within the facet joints. Facet joint disease may be a significant cause of low back pain. The above three criteria are useful in clinical identification of patients with this problem. Facet joint injections play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain.

input: Abstract: Light and electron microscopy were used to demonstrate extensive matrix degradation in a failed chymopapain-treated disc as compared with an untreated degenerative control disc. Both specimens contained viable cells with patches of degenerative cells. There was a loss of disc height in the chymopapain-treated disc, but no improvement of symptoms. These results illustrated that even in well-circumscribed cases with documented disc protrusion into the spinal canal, the disc space narrowing following injection may aggravate the symptoms of nerve root entrapment, especially if a low-grade lateral recess stenosis is associated with the disc protrusion. The persistence or aggravation of symptoms probably is related to these anatomic considerations. The low level of enzyme activity in the injected area may or may not be correlated with the clinical response to treatment.

input: Abstract: Of 34 tibia fractures in 28 acute spinal cord injuries, 13 patients had complete and 15 had incomplete neurologic lesions. Tibia fractures were divided into three groups: Group I, nonoperative treatment; Group II, early open reduction and internal fixation; and Group III, Type III open injuries. Group I included 17 fractures, of which nine (53%) had delayed union, malunion, or nonunion. The average time to union was 6.5 months. Seven patients had pressure sores and pulmonary emboli. Eleven fractures were noted in Group II. One delayed union (9%), one superficial wound infection that healed uneventfully, and one deep vein thrombosis were noted. The average time to union was 12 weeks. All six Group III tibias had delayed and nonunions, regardless of treatment. Nonoperative fractures healed at a prolonged rate, while open reduction and internal fixation enhanced the rate and time to union. Fractures treated with early open reduction and internal fixation, excluding Group III patients, had the least orthopedic and medical complications. Open reduction and internal fixation is a justifiable alternative to nonoperative treatment in the uncomplicated tibia fracture regardless of neurologic lesion for improved medical and fracture care.

input: Abstract: Maquet recommended 2-2.5 cm of anterior tibial tubercle elevation for patients with symptomatic osteoarthrosis of the patellofemoral joint. Fifty-three patients with osteoarthrosis were divided into three groups. The first 12 patients were treated by the classical Maquet procedure; 11 were totally relieved of patellofemoral pain, but there was one failure and five complications. In the second group of 32 patients, the patella was realigned within its groove to alter tracking of the patella to the proximal femoral condyles when necessary. Fish-mouthing technique and insertion of a drain after surgery were done. After a two-year follow-up examination, there were two failures and five complications. A third group of nine patients was treated with Ferguson's modification of Maquet's operation using a 1.25-cm tibial tubercle elevation through a transverse incision; two of the nine had complications, subsequently treated successfully by converting Ferguson's operation into the Maquet operation, as modified for Group II. The modified Maquet procedure can be an effective and reliable treatment of patellofemoral arthrosis with a relatively low incidence of complications.

input: Abstract: Bilateral simultaneous Achilles tendon ruptures are rare, with only ten cases reported in the English literature. Our case is that of a 44-year-old woman, along with a review of the literature. Affected persons usually are on chronic steroid treatment and in the fifth to seventh decades of life. The patient may have concomitant systemic disease, and the injury occurs with relatively mild trauma. The goals of treatment are mainly preventative, i.e., cessation of steroids as soon as possible and protective bracing of the remaining intact Achilles tendon.
