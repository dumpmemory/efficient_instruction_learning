 Person1:      I love sashimi . Did mom bring any soy sauce for that ?  
 Person2:  I suppose she did . Be quiet . There is a fish on the hook . Here it is . Look , a big one .

 Person2:  Great idea . But the fact is we have no barbecue with us . Moreover , the sashimi will be great . So why do we bother to waste time on barbecuing the fish ?  
 Person1:      Well , all right . There is nothing to complain about .
