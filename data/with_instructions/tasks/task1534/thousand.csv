 Person1:      Well , all right . There is nothing to complain about .

input:  Person1:     What do you think is harder , reading or writing ?  
 Person2:  Well , they ’ re completely different . Reading is passive , and writing is active .  
 Person1:      I don ’ t think I understand what you mean . Could you explain a little more ?  
 Person2:  In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . In writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page .  
 Person1:      Oh , now I see what you mean . When you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something !  
 Person2:  A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . Don ’ t you think so ?  
 Person1:      I think I see what you mean . I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can ’ t write it .  
 Person2:  Exactly .  
 Person1:      So I have another question for you . What do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ?  
 Person2:  They ’ re both harder than reading or writing .  
 Person1:      In what way ?  
 Person2:  Because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of English .  
 Person1:      You are making me feel really discouraged .  
 Person2:  I ’ m not trying to discourage you . I ’ m trying to help you . You have to live with these difficulties . Isn ’ t it better to know about them ? The more you know about what you have to face , the better you ’ ll do . I promise !

 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:      Why do they go there ?  
 Person2:  Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .

 Person1:      I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?  
 Person2:  I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .  
 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?  
 Person2:  Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way .

 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:      Why do they go there ?

 Person2:  It ’ s a program about islam . It ’ s very interesting .  
 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:      Why do they go there ?  
 Person2:  Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .  
 Person1:      When muslims pray , they face towards mecca .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .  
 Person1:      I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?  
 Person2:  I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .  
 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?  
 Person2:  Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way .

 Person1:      Yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful .

 Person1:      I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last .

 Person1:      Hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home .  
 Person2:  A plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to get through the customs ?  
 Person1:      I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border .  
 Person2:  I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble .

 Person1:      Then we drive west on the M25 . we must be careful to turn in the right direction !  
 Person2:  Then we drive on the M25 . it turns south . When we reach exit 15 , we turn left and go west along the M4 .  
 Person1:      Then we take the first Heathrow Airport . What ’ s the total distance ?  
 Person2:  The journey around the M25 is 33 miles and then 3 extra miles to get to the airport . So how many miles is that together ?  
 Person1:      22 miles to the M25 , 33 miles on the M25 , and 3 after that . That ’ s a total of 58 miles , isn ’ t it ?  
 Person2:  It shouldn ’ t take us very long to cover that distance . Remember that we can go quite fast on the motor way .  
 Person1:      We can only go fast on the motor ways if there isn ’ t much traffic . I think we should allow ourselves plenty of time to get there . Being early is much better than being late .

 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?

 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?  
 Person2:  Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way .

 Person2:  It ’ s a program about islam . It ’ s very interesting .  
 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:      Why do they go there ?  
 Person2:  Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .  
 Person1:      When muslims pray , they face towards mecca .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .  
 Person1:      I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?  
 Person2:  I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .  
 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?

 Person2:  Yes . All international ping-pong tournaments have become a demonstration of Chinese supremacy in the sport .  
 Person1:      Do you know any secrets to China's success ?  
 Person2:  In the first place , I think the whole nation is just fond of the game . It is well grounded with the mass . With huge numbers of people playing ping-pong , we can always spot a handful of potential world champions .  
 Person1:      So , the national ping-pong team must be a highly competitive membership .  
 Person2:  Sure . There is a careful mechanism for selecting players from provincial teams , and those lucky dogs have to observe strict rules .  
 Person1:      For example ?  
 Person2:  They are subject to hard training . And you know what , for a player on the national team , personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . They are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other .  
 Person1:      Oh , dear ! It's an encroachment on individual rights !  
 Person2:  Well , ping-pong is our national sport , and we just have to keep winning one honor after another . That's why many people think such rules acceptable . After all , they are funded out of taxpayers'money .

Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting .  
 Person2:  I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable .  
 Person1:      Predictable ! How ! Come on Dick , It ’ s a G-rated movie ! It ’ s for the kids ! It ’ s not a thriller !  
 Person2:  Well , that ’ s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ’ s just too cliche .  
 Person1:      How can it be cliche ? It ’ s a fable ! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story ! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love .  
 Person2:  You have always been so soft , Dave !  
 Person1:      Open your heart Dick . Don ’ t shut us out .  
 Person2:  Anyway ... That ’ s all for today folks ! Join us next time as we talk about & quot , How to lose a guy in 10 days & quot , I ’ m sure you ’ ll love that one Dave !

 Person2:  was it very old house ?  
 Person1:      it was about 75 years old . There were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time .

 Person2:  I didn ’ t know you were a twin ! Are you identical or fraternal ?  
 Person1:      We ’ re identical . I mean , we look exactly the same , but we are complete opposites when it comes to everything else .  
 Person2:  Interesting . It must be great having a twin sister . Are you best friends , too ?  
 Person1:      We used to be really close , but that all changed once she moved to Shanghai . How about your family ? You didn ’ t mention to your biological father .  
 Person2:  I don ’ t know much about him . He died when I was just a baby . Even though I don ’ t have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother , I consider them to be my real family .

 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:      Why do they go there ?  
 Person2:  Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .

 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?  
 Person2:  I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .  
 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?

 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?

 Person1:      Why do they go there ?  
 Person2:  Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .

 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?

 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?

 Person2:  It ’ s a program about islam . It ’ s very interesting .  
 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:      Why do they go there ?  
 Person2:  Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .  
 Person1:      When muslims pray , they face towards mecca .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .  
 Person1:      I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?

input:  Person1:     So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ?  
 Person2:  Nine total . Seven children and my parents .  
 Person1:      Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ?  
 Person2:  Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it .  
 Person1:      Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right .  
 Person2:  It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make .  
 Person1:      Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy .  
 Person2:  That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs .  
 Person1:      And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common .  
 Person2:  Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college .  
 Person1:      Well , at least going to college won't be too bad . Since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college .  
 Person2:  They do , but it doesn't help too much . Having seven children means that the money situation in my home is always pretty tight .

 Person1:      Because you study day in and day out for the entrance exam . So I figure you would study even harder after you ’ Ve got in .  
 Person2:  Studying in the university is not easy , but it's not as arduous as you think .  
 Person1:      How do you know that ? You haven't got in yet .  
 Person2:  Of course I know . I once attended Lisa's class , sitting quietly at the back of the classroom .  
 Person1:      Oh , really ? Were you not caught ?  
 Person2:  Of course not . You are allowed to attend any lecture , only if there are empty seats for you and you don't disturb the class . In universities , you study in a free and creative environment .  
 Person1:      What do you want to study in the university ? Have you thought about it ?  
 Person2:  This question has really been bothering me . I like Chinese literature , you know . But economics is really hot now , and it has a very good career prospect .  
 Person1:      I will choose what I like . You don't know what a torture it is for me to study English , because I don't like English .  
 Person2:  Though I like Chinese literature very much , I'm also interested in economics . It's a tough choice to make .  
 Person1:      You can decide later . You will have choices before you submit your university application form .  
 Person2:  Right . I have lots of time to think carefully before I make my final decision .

 Person2:  Thank you , Rick ! As you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars !  
 Person1:      Whoa , that ’ s a lot of cash ! Let ’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing .  
 Person2:  All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole !  
 Person1:      Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous .  
 Person2:  Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot .  
 Person1:      It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it .  
 Person2:  Oh no ! A bear ! Run , Tiger , run ! Somebody call animal control !

And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney . There are lots of great clubs . And people were very , very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney .  
 Person1:      Mm-hm . How long were you there ?  
 Person2:  I was there for almost a year .  
 Person1:      Oh , OK .  
 Person2:  And I travelled a little bit in Australia . I went up the east coast . Up to Frasier Island . Which is a world heritage site . And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the ... , which is a but north . And the further north you go in Australia , the hotter it gets . So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license , so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly .  
 Person1:      So , did you , did you lose your finger ?  
 Person2:  Almost .  
 Person1:      Almost . Ah , you're lucky . Um , it's funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams .  
 Person2:  Exactly .  
 Person1:      Will you be going back to Australia soon ?  
 Person2:  I'd like to go and live there for at least another year . Probably I'll go back to Sydney or maybe I'll go down to Melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city . They have lot of museums and parks .

 Person2:  It ’ s a program about islam . It ’ s very interesting .  
 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:      Why do they go there ?  
 Person2:  Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .  
 Person1:      When muslims pray , they face towards mecca .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .  
 Person1:      I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?  
 Person2:  I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .  
 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?  
 Person2:  Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way .

Now complete the following example-
input:  Person1:     Can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ?  
 Person2:  Sure . If you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective .  
 Person1:      I need to excise my arms too . How can I do that ?  
 Person2:  One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet !  
 Person1:      When I do push-ups , should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ?  
 Person2:  You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend their bodies at the waist , which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise .  
 Person1:      What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ?  
 Person2:  One that I recommend is that you lie on your back . You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out either side of your body .  
 Person1:      So I need plenty of space for this exercise .  
 Person2:  Yes , you do . Lift the weight up , keeping your arms straight all the time .  
 Person1:      Great . Thanks for you advice !

 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:      Why do they go there ?

 Person1:      When muslims pray , they face towards mecca .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .  
 Person1:      I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?  
 Person2:  I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .  
 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?  
 Person2:  Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way .

 Person1:      Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ?  
 Person2:  The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .  
 Person1:      How are they at swimming ?  
 Person2:  They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .  
 Person1:      Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .  
 Person2:  I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height !  
 Person1:      I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher .  
 Person2:  It seems that they really enjoy to go faster , higher and further .

 Person1:      And my wife would be happy if I bought her a mink coat .

 Person1:      But it seems like a good idea . All I have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter . After that he'll tell me how to earn much more money .  
 Person2:  Sounds like a pyramid scheme . Have you heard of those before ?  
 Person1:      Pyramid scheme ? What is that ?  
 Person2:  It's a scam 7 that's based on a hierarchy , like a pyramid . The person at the top asks the people below him for money , and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him .  
 Person1:      Sounds good to me . The guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him .  
 Person2:  Not exactly . The scam keeps on going , with the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom .  
 Person1:      What happens then ?  
 Person2:  Nothing . The people at the bottom give their money to the people above them , and they get nothing . They end up losing . That's why it's a scam .  
 Person1:      I see . I guess I should be more careful about what I read , especially on the Internet where you have no idea who anybody is .

 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:      Why do they go there ?  
 Person2:  Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .  
 Person1:      When muslims pray , they face towards mecca .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .  
 Person1:      I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?  
 Person2:  I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .  
 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?  
 Person2:  Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way .

input:  Person1:     Good morning , Jason . How did you sleep ?  
 Person2:  Pretty well , thanks . Still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit , but last night I got at lease six hours of rest .  
 Person1:      Great ! So , are you ready for a full day of shopping ?  
 Person2:  Yep . Let's do it . I'm pretty excited !  
 Person1:      I know a place that should be perfect . It's called the China Friendship Shopping Center and it's pretty much like an American mall - except with more variety . You can even buy a live chicken there if you want .  
 Person2:  Live chicken ? Thanks , but no thanks . So ... tell me about bargaining . How can I do it like a local ?  
 Person1:      Well . I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person . You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that . But ... if you're smart , you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price .  
 Person2:  Cool ! Teach me !  
 Person1:      For starters , you want to do a lot of scouting first . You've got to know what things cost .  
 Person2:  Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs . The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items , you can figure out the relative prices of everything else .  
 Person1:      That could be helpful . But when you go into a shopping center ... prices become very flexible . You have to be able to read the market .

 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?

 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?

 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?  
 Person2:  Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way .

input:  Person1:     Have you ever seen Bill Gate's home on the internet ?  
 Person2:  No . what's it like ?  
 Person1:      It's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through a remote control . It's also located near the sea , so he can park his boats next to his house . It's absolutely amazing !  
 Person2:  Would you want to live there ?  
 Person1:      I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and probably an au pair or two to take care of the children . It's just too big of a place to take care of on your own .  
 Person2:  What's your dreamhole like then ?  
 Person1:      My dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quiet village in England .  
 Person2:  Would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ?  
 Person1:      Old homes are great because they've got character . I think that's important .  
 Person2:  Is that why you wear second-hand clothes as well ? Because they've got character ?  
 Person1:      No , that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time !  
 Person2:  I see . If you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ?  
 Person1:      No , I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years ago would be a great way to feed my imagination even more !

 Person2:  It ’ s a program about islam . It ’ s very interesting .  
 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:      Why do they go there ?  
 Person2:  Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .  
 Person1:      When muslims pray , they face towards mecca .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .  
 Person1:      I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?  
 Person2:  I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .  
 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?  
 Person2:  Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way .

 Person2:  Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights .  
 Person1:      Yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings .  
 Person2:  I understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . If so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala .  
 Person1:      You can ’ t compare apples and oranges . I believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching .  
 Person2:  Well , you are right on that point . This is the reason that I don ’ t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products .  
 Person1:      As long as you don ’ t treat it better than your wife , it ’ s fine .

 Person2:  Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .  
 Person1:      When muslims pray , they face towards mecca .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .  
 Person1:      I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?  
 Person2:  I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .  
 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?  
 Person2:  Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way .

input:  Person1:     can you help me pick out some fabric for a suit ? I'm going to get one made for a friend's wedding .  
 Person2:  sure . What kind of material do you want for the suit to be made from ?  
 Person1:      it depends on the price , but I was thinking of getting a wool / cashmere blend .  
 Person2:  that will probably be quite expensive , but the more you pay for the fabric , the longer it'll last and the better it'll look . What color do you want the suit to be ?  
 Person1:      I was thinking of a brown pin-striped suit .  
 Person2:  brown , huh ? Isn't that a bit dull ?  
 Person1:      haven't you heard ? Brown is the new black .  
 Person2:  why don't you just get black ? Black suits are always fashionable and can be worn for anything — a funeral , a wedding , a job interview — anything !  
 Person1:      that may be true , but black is so boring . Anyway , I already have three black suits . I might as well get a suit that stands out from the rest .  
 Person2:  here are two different shades of brown . Which one do you prefer ?  
 Person1:      I like the one on the left , but I don't like the pattern on it . It's too much . I want a pattern that's a bit subtler .  
 Person2:  how about this one ?  
 Person1:      I think that will do . Let's go talk to the tailor about getting it made .  
 Person2:  ok , let's go .

 Person1:      If you like the class this much already , I ’ m sure you will .  
 Person2:  I hope so .  
 Person1:      did she give you any homework ?  
 Person2:  not today . She said she wanted us to relax tonight instead of doing homework ,  
 Person1:      no wonder you like the class so much .

 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:      Why do they go there ?

 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?  
 Person2:  I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .  
 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?

 Person2:  Me ! Me !  
 Person1:      Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this .  
 Person2:  Wait , what are you doing ? I ’ m a married woman ! You can ’ t just try to kiss me like this !  
 Person1:      Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency .  
 Person2:  Well , OK . But no French kissing !  
 Person1:      As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ’ s chest , and press down firmly two or three times .  
 Person2:  Wait , what are you doing ! You can ’ t just kiss me then go for second base !

 Person2:  It ’ s a program about islam . It ’ s very interesting .  
 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:      Why do they go there ?  
 Person2:  Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .  
 Person1:      When muslims pray , they face towards mecca .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .  
 Person1:      I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?  
 Person2:  I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .  
 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?

 Person2:  My husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed that the wedding party should be less about money and more about family .  
 Person1:      That makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ?

 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .

input:  Person1:     Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ?  
 Person2:  Cinct de mayo ?  
 Person1:      No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day .  
 Person2:  Do we get a day off from school then ?  
 Person1:      No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .  
 Person2:  Www , man !  
 Person1:      In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .  
 Person2:  Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?  
 Person1:      Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .  
 Person2:  And then what happened ?  
 Person1:      Well , as we say , the rest is history ...

 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?  
 Person2:  I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .  
 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?  
 Person2:  Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way .

 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .

 Person2:  No , but parents control a lot of the environment that kids grow up in , so they certainly influence their kids ' personalities a lot .  
 Person1:      So why do you think many kids have personalities that are so different from their parents .  
 Person2:  Maybe when they become teenagers , they want to be completely different to their parents .  
 Person1:      You might be right . I guess most parents want their kids to be like them , but kids today grow up in a different environment . You know , they know much more about the world from the internet , newspapers , and tv .  
 Person2:  Do you think that teenagers get a lot of their bad behaviour from tv and movies ?  
 Person1:      Maybe some of it . I think a lot of people blame TV and movies when the real problem is that the parents aren ’ t bringing their child up correctly .  
 Person2:  Parents have a difficult job . They have to bring up their children and usually have to work too .  
 Person1:      Yes , that ’ s true . Your son is doing well at school , isn ’ t he ?  
 Person2:  Yes , he is . He ’ s very hardworking when he ’ s at school . Then he comes home from school and does homework before dinner . After dinner , he goes out with his friends .  
 Person1:      So , he ’ s not a bookworm ? It ’ s good that he has an outgoing personality . Some kids are very quiet and introverted . You wonder they ’ ll survive in the real world without their parents to support them .

 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?

 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .

 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?

 Person1:      do you think the glass ceiling phenomena is because of traditional social customs ? Or are there more issues coming into play ?  
 Person2:  I think it's a very complicated issue . A part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers . Don't underestimate the good ole ' boy system . Men have power , so it's easier for them to stay in power .  
 Person1:      What about affirmative action ? Hasn't legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy ?  
 Person2:  Affirmative action has given us management quotas and bans sexual discrimination , but it's still a man's world .

input:  Person1:     what do you think about all the different diets people go on ?  
 Person2:  I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !  
 Person1:      but what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ?  
 Person2:  they need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though .  
 Person1:      so you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?

 Person1:      how about drinking soda ?

 Person1:      how do you know so much about food and dieting ?  
 Person2:  you might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now !

 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:      Why do they go there ?  
 Person2:  Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .

 Person2:  It ’ s a program about islam . It ’ s very interesting .  
 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:      Why do they go there ?  
 Person2:  Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .  
 Person1:      When muslims pray , they face towards mecca .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .  
 Person1:      I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?

 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?

input:  Person1:     Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ?  
 Person2:  Cinct de mayo ?  
 Person1:      No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day .  
 Person2:  Do we get a day off from school then ?  
 Person1:      No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .  
 Person2:  Www , man !  
 Person1:      In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .  
 Person2:  Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?  
 Person1:      Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .  
 Person2:  And then what happened ?  
 Person1:      Well , as we say , the rest is history ...

 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .

 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?

 Person2:  Because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life .

 Person2:  Yes , Jerry , can you share your understanding of EQ ?  
 Person1:      I think it is independent of IQ and plays a prominent role in deciding the way we live our lives .

 Person2:  I bought a sewing machine . I know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems .  
 Person1:      What ’ s wrong with it ?  
 Person2:  She says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . When she uses it , it makes a funny noise .  
 Person1:      Household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays .  
 Person2:  I think it ’ s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . Because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances don ’ t need to last more than five or ten years at most .

 Person2:  Well . Obviously , you won ’ t want All Risks cover .  
 Person1:      Why not ?  
 Person2:  Because they aren ’ t delicate goods and won ’ t likely be damaged on the voyage . FPA will be good enough .  
 Person1:      Then am I right in understanding that FPA doesn't cover partial loss for the nature of particular average .  
 Person2:  That's right . On the other hand , a WA policy covers you against partial loss in all cases .  
 Person1:      Are there any other clauses in marine policies ?

 Person2:  I think housing is a big problem . There are thousands of homeless people on the streets .  
 Person1:      How would you solve the problem ?  
 Person2:  I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .  
 Person1:      It would probably be very expensive .  
 Person2:  I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs i  
 Person1:      It ’ s not a bad idea . I think education is the biggest problem at the moment . Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly .  
 Person2:  If we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . That wouldn ’ t be popular with voters .  
 Person1:      Most voters what everything both ways . They want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes .  
 Person2:  The government should show that it is using money efficiently . Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project .  
 Person1:      Yes . The government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly

 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:      Why do they go there ?  
 Person2:  Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .

 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .

 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .

 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?  
 Person2:  I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .  
 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?

 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?

 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:      Why do they go there ?

 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .

 Person2:  Why don't you get a new one ?  
 Person1:      I don't know . I like this one , and I don't have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones .  
 Person2:  Really , what makes you say that ?  
 Person1:      Well , I just need to make and receive calls , and it's quite reliable . I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things , the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong , you know ? I mean , this camera function , for instance-how often do you use it ?  
 Person2:  Sometimes , but I guess not very often . It's more for fun . Sometimes when I'm on a trip , for example , I can take a picture and send it to my kids . Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately .  
 Person1:      Well , that's nice I guess . So how many kids do you have ?  
 Person2:  Three . Two boys and a girl .

 Person2:  It ’ s a program about islam . It ’ s very interesting .  
 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:      Why do they go there ?  
 Person2:  Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .  
 Person1:      When muslims pray , they face towards mecca .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .  
 Person1:      I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .

 Person2:  Is there anything you don't do in-house ?  
 Person1:      Yes . If we don't have the facilities to deal with it here , we send it out for maintenance .  
 Person2:  Is that more expensive ?  
 Person1:      It depends on the job . It's actually more cost-effective than buying specialist equipment that we don't use very often .

 Person2:  Didn't he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? He got arrested for that , didn't he ?  
 Person1:      He got arrested all right .  
 Person2:  If I remember , he got off with a light sentence . Something like three years in a minimum-security prison .  
 Person1:      Yup , that's him . He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless .  
 Person2:  I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He's still a millionaire .  
 Person1:      That's the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail .  
 Person2:  I know . And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years .  
 Person1:      Yup , you got it . Criminals in America do a lot better if they're white-collar thieves .

 Person2:  Oh don ’ t worry , sweetie , I didn ’ t know when you were going to propose . It was still a nice surprise ! As I was saying , I ’ Ve got it all planned out . There ’ s almost nothing left to do ! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending .  
 Person1:      Four hundred ?  
 Person2:  No need to sweat it . My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding , which is going to be low-budget anyway . So roughly four hundred people , which means that the hall at Northwoods Heights will be our reception venue . I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents ’ church and my uncle of course would be officiating . We ’ ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling . The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer . My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that . My cousin will be the official photographer . I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . Did you know that she ’ s going to be a professional opera singer ?  
 Person1:      Ah ...  
 Person2:  And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ’ ll get the Youth Group to serve us . I was thinking that your friend ’ s band could be our entertainment for the night . though they might have to tone it down a bit . Or we could hire a DJ . Your sister ’ s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ’ s their name again ? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine . And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ’ ll make our toasts ! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? Who else am I missing ? Oh , your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake !  
 Person1:      Wow .  
 Person2:  See ? It ’ s going to be wonderful ! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of .

 Person2:  One study said that low-income groups have a higher percentage of over-weight people than higher income families .  
 Person1:      Why ?  
 Person2:  The survey said that the low , income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis .  
 Person1:      That makes sense . Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper .  
 Person2:  And junk food contains lots of fat and oil . There is one final reason why so many people are fat .  
 Person1:      What's that ?  
 Person2:  Nobody exercises any more-not even kids ! The average American home has the TV on for 6 hours a day !  
 Person1:      Wow ! No wonder people are so fat . Say , Carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising .  
 Person2:  Yeah , I guess so .  
 Person1:      You should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise .  
 Person2:  Hey , I started a diet and lost 10 pounds .  
 Person1:      So what happened ?  
 Person2:  Well , I quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .  
 Person1:      You should have kept trying .

 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:      Why do they go there ?  
 Person2:  Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .

 Person2:  That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .

 Person1:      Did you have any difficulty getting along with fellow students or teachers ?  
 Person2:  No . Not at all . I'm quite easy-going .  
 Person1:      What's your strong points ?  
 Person2:  Oh , I'm very responsible , I can make fast decisions , and I do not need much supervision . I enjoy completing challenging tasks .  
 Person1:      What do you dislike most about your job ?  
 Person2:  Probably routine , dull work . Oh , I am much more enthusiastic if I'm given a challenge and responsibility .  
 Person1:      What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a supervisor and employee ?  
 Person2:  A friendly one . I think an open , friendly , honest relationship should exist . An employee should feel she ( he ) can go to her ( his ) boss anytime with any kind of question .  
 Person1:      Sometimes working with a foreign company can be stressful . Foreigners tend to get excited or angry easily , and they show it . Are you sure you can handle this stress ? How do you deal with conflict in your present job ?  
 Person2:  Well , there's a lot of stress in a Chinese company also , although much of it is below the surface . I have confidence in my ability to handle conflict . If I have a problem with a co-worker , I do everything I can to work it out directly with that person . If I am unable to work it out , then I ask a supervisor to help out . If my boss shouts at me , I try not to take it personally . I try my best to understand the stress he is under . It's kind of like being in a family . Often family members say things in the heat of the moment , but don't mean what they say . A company is like a family , it has good times and bad times .  
 Person1:      How do you feel about overtime work ?  
 Person2:  That's no problem . I know that every company has busy periods . When this happens , I'm ready to put in as much time as necessary to get the job done .  
 Person1:      What is most important to you in a job ?  
 Person2:  I want to feel that I am making a real contribution to the company , so I would like my boss to trust me with important work .  
 Person1:      Do you think that you are introverted or extroverted ?  
 Person2:  I'm quite outspoken . I enjoy calling a spade a spade and hate talking in a roundabout way . So I'd call myself outgoing .  
 Person1:      Under what kind of circumstance will you lose your temper ?  
 Person2:  Seldom . But I hate someone's frequently being late or lazy .  
 Person1:      OK . What are your strong points ?  
 Person2:  Hmm . as I mentioned , I can work well under pressure and I enjoy work that challenges me . I think that my English ability is also a strong point .  
 Person1:      And your weaknesses ?  
 Person2:  I think I sometimes try to be over-organized . So I am learning how to let some things go and concentrate on the most important part of my job .

 Person2:  Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .  
 Person1:      When muslims pray , they face towards mecca .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .  
 Person1:      I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?  
 Person2:  I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .  
 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?  
 Person2:  Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way .

 Person1:      Are you serious ? Why would they have to go to such extreme measures like a strike ? Doesn't your company have a pretty good corporate image ? I'll bet the folks at headquarters are going nuts over something as serious as a strike ...

Usually it only lasts a day or two before both sides can come to an agreement and we start work again . Anyhow , it's a nice , unanticipated holiday ...

input:  Person1:     We've got a problem ... it looks like we'll need more spotlights on the exhibition booth . The client thinks it's too dark , and they want to add halogen lighting . We've already got 3 sets of track lighting from you guys , do you think you could help us out and throw in some halogens ?  
 Person2:  Oh ... Um ... I don't think so . you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system . Plus I'm going to have to call in some guys to install it for you . That's not going to come cheap .  
 Person1:      But it would only be adding to the existing structure . We're not talking about anything new here ...  
 Person2:  It doesn't matter because we will still have to call the electrician out , and they are union labor . It'll cost you a pretty penny ...  
 Person1:      How much do you think it would cost ?  
 Person2:  Mumm , I estimate it'll run in the neighborhood of ... $ 500 per light .  
 Person1:      $ 500per light ? ! That's ridiculous ! It can't possibly be that expansive !  
 Person2:  It is , I'll tell you why . We'll have to call in the electrician , he's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5PM , and it will probably take him an hour a light . Plus , the halogen lights take more electricity , so your electrical cost is going to be higher as well .  
 Person1:      Can't you give me a break on this ? We've already spent so much money on lighting , I hate to have to blow so much more on halogens .  
 Person2:  No , that's the cost , and that's what it's going to cost us . We can't go in the hole with this . I am giving you my best price , so take it , or leave it .

 Person1:      Why do they go there ?  
 Person2:  Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .  
 Person1:      When muslims pray , they face towards mecca .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .  
 Person1:      I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?  
 Person2:  I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .  
 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?  
 Person2:  Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way .

input:  Person1:     are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ?  
 Person2:  of course . Is the dinner still on ?  
 Person1:      yes , I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .  
 Person2:  we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .  
 Person1:      that's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark .  
 Person2:  it can't be that bad .  
 Person1:      I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .  
 Person2:  really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime .  
 Person1:      do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better .  
 Person2:  ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ?  
 Person1:      when I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation .  
 Person2:  has anything else happened to you ?  
 Person1:      nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close .  
 Person2:  well , we'll be careful . Thanks for letting me know .
