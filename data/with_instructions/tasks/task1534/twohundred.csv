 Person1:      Well , all right . There is nothing to complain about .

input:  Person1:     What do you think is harder , reading or writing ?  
 Person2:  Well , they ’ re completely different . Reading is passive , and writing is active .  
 Person1:      I don ’ t think I understand what you mean . Could you explain a little more ?  
 Person2:  In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . In writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page .  
 Person1:      Oh , now I see what you mean . When you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something !  
 Person2:  A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . Don ’ t you think so ?  
 Person1:      I think I see what you mean . I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can ’ t write it .  
 Person2:  Exactly .  
 Person1:      So I have another question for you . What do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ?  
 Person2:  They ’ re both harder than reading or writing .  
 Person1:      In what way ?  
 Person2:  Because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of English .  
 Person1:      You are making me feel really discouraged .  
 Person2:  I ’ m not trying to discourage you . I ’ m trying to help you . You have to live with these difficulties . Isn ’ t it better to know about them ? The more you know about what you have to face , the better you ’ ll do . I promise !

 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:      Why do they go there ?  
 Person2:  Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .

 Person1:      I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?  
 Person2:  I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .  
 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?  
 Person2:  Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way .

 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:      Why do they go there ?

 Person2:  It ’ s a program about islam . It ’ s very interesting .  
 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:      Why do they go there ?  
 Person2:  Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .  
 Person1:      When muslims pray , they face towards mecca .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .  
 Person1:      I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?  
 Person2:  I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .  
 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?  
 Person2:  Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way .

 Person1:      Yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful .

 Person1:      I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last .

 Person1:      Hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home .  
 Person2:  A plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to get through the customs ?  
 Person1:      I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border .  
 Person2:  I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble .

 Person1:      Then we drive west on the M25 . we must be careful to turn in the right direction !  
 Person2:  Then we drive on the M25 . it turns south . When we reach exit 15 , we turn left and go west along the M4 .  
 Person1:      Then we take the first Heathrow Airport . What ’ s the total distance ?  
 Person2:  The journey around the M25 is 33 miles and then 3 extra miles to get to the airport . So how many miles is that together ?  
 Person1:      22 miles to the M25 , 33 miles on the M25 , and 3 after that . That ’ s a total of 58 miles , isn ’ t it ?  
 Person2:  It shouldn ’ t take us very long to cover that distance . Remember that we can go quite fast on the motor way .  
 Person1:      We can only go fast on the motor ways if there isn ’ t much traffic . I think we should allow ourselves plenty of time to get there . Being early is much better than being late .

 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?

 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?  
 Person2:  Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way .

input:  Person1:     Hi ! What are you watching ?  
 Person2:  It ’ s a program about islam . It ’ s very interesting .  
 Person1:      Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:      Why do they go there ?  
 Person2:  Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .  
 Person1:      When muslims pray , they face towards mecca .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .  
 Person1:      I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .  
 Person2:  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:      Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?  
 Person2:  I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .  
 Person1:      Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?  
 Person2:  Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way .

Now complete the following example-
input:  Person1:     At the Beijing Olympics , all four table tennis events were all-Chinese finals . A clean sweep again !  
 Person2:  Yes . All international ping-pong tournaments have become a demonstration of Chinese supremacy in the sport .  
 Person1:      Do you know any secrets to China's success ?  
 Person2:  In the first place , I think the whole nation is just fond of the game . It is well grounded with the mass . With huge numbers of people playing ping-pong , we can always spot a handful of potential world champions .  
 Person1:      So , the national ping-pong team must be a highly competitive membership .  
 Person2:  Sure . There is a careful mechanism for selecting players from provincial teams , and those lucky dogs have to observe strict rules .  
 Person1:      For example ?  
 Person2:  They are subject to hard training . And you know what , for a player on the national team , personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . They are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other .  
 Person1:      Oh , dear ! It's an encroachment on individual rights !  
 Person2:  Well , ping-pong is our national sport , and we just have to keep winning one honor after another . That's why many people think such rules acceptable . After all , they are funded out of taxpayers'money .
