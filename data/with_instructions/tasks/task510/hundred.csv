Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this was about 10 years ago.

i worked as break relief in a bread factory. a ""wonderful"" bread factory, that at the time produced 3400-4000 loaves of bread per hour, and on a separate line 1800-3200 units of rolls (hamburg buns etc.) per hour. i was tasked with the job of relieving people for their breaks which were 20 minutes in length. 

there was this one job as a mixer operator. basically the job entails running a huge mixing machine, and the volume it could contain was measured in the thousands of gallons. typically, it would produce about 500 kg of dough every 15 minutes. visualize a 10 foot tall horseshoe-shaped bowl rotated vertically that is rotated down to empty and you get the idea.

so, to make dough, you have 4 basic ingredients: flour, water, yeast, and at this place, vegetable oil.

when i went to relieve the guy working this job, there has just been a change in the formula. to change the formula, you enter the new amounts of water, flour etc. on a keypad, and then press ""submit"" to save the changes.

what i hadn't noticed until it was too late was that the previous operator had forgotten to press ""submit"" on the amount of yeast for the new formula. so, what happened was i pressed the button to discharge flour, water, oil, and then yeast into the mixture, and then immediately noticed that the volume of yeast indicated on the panel was flashing, indicating that the previous operator did not press submit, and without intervention the machine will discharge only the amount that was in the previous formula. 

to correct this, for the first time ever, i pressed the big red stop button beside the control panel for yeast, inputted the correct amount less than the amount already discharged, and pressed the discharge button again. satisfied that i believe what i did was the right thing, i started the mix cycle, walked away and did something else.

15 minutes later, i'm relieving a different guy, but i have line of sight to the mixing machine. at the end of the cycle, the operator i relieved previously started to rotate the bowl, and not even after 10 degrees of rotation did a few dozen gallons of liquid yeast pour out. the mixing machine was completely full of yeast!

what had happened was, for some asinine reason, the ""stop"" button also reboots the plcs controlling the valve . i acted so quickly in inputting new numbers that the plc hadn't rebooted before i had hit the submit button. meaning, the valve was now stuck open. why they hadn't coded for that i'll never know.

in total, thousands of gallons of yeast were discharged into this mixing machine without anybody knowing for 15 minutes. as normally the amount used per run would be measured in the single digits of gallons, the facility only kept enough yeast to last about 3 days of normal production. this ""glitch"" ha actually depleted every last bit of yeast stored at the facility. they had to have a truck sent from a facility about 8 hours away to resupply, causing about 10 hours of downtime.

did i get fired? almost! they did try to scapegoat me saying i didn't follow proper procedure etc. but, the union came to my rescue and allowed me to keep my job. apparently this little bit of information was placed in the maintenance manuals, which are never provided to the operators for training.

input: Text: actually a couple months ago. forgot about it until now. i was on my school trip to dc, it was my first time going there so i was pumped. we went to see all of the main touristy attractions (this is day one) then lastly we go on this big yacht. it is pretty popular but i do not remember the name off of the top of my head. at this point i haven't slept for maybe 48 hours, as i can't sleep in vehicles and it is about an 8 hour ride down. i was sitting with my friend and looking out into the river, on the back of the boat. i lean over the railing and look down. my glasses decide to slide off my face. *shit what do i do now?* i text my mom to tell her my new glasses just fell through the propeller of a huge boat and are now chilling in the potomac. this was only at the start of the ride and i couldn't see at all for the rest of the time. remember this is only day one out of two. i missed on seeing about half of the stuff, including arlington, the lincoln, korean, and vietnam memorials.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: okay so giving the background to this story-
i'm a girl and my friends and i had been invited to come over to a house full of hot guys to chill. so naturally we go, and there's one hot guy i talk to the most, and we click and talk more and play beer pong. 
so we both get super drunk and we ended up in someone's bedroom where we proceeded to make out and take off each other's clothes. this next park might be tmi and you might get grossed out but it was literally the most embarrassed i've ever been with a guy.
so things escalate and he starts doing me, and then we switch positions and i start to give him a bj.
here's the bad part.
my stomach started to hurt from all the cheap burnettes mixed with cheap beer and after i gagged once there was no going back.
i threw up all over his junk. literally all over.
but here's the best part: he kept going.
he must've really wanted to fucking finish because we switched positions while there's vomit all over the bed and still on his dick.
needless to say i threw up again, and when he finally finished we kind of sobered up and realized there was fucking throw up all over us.
i apologized like a million times but he was a trooper and actually hugged me.
now we're friends on instagram. i'm still confused 

.

update: question to all guys out there: if this happened to you would you keep going, stop and be grossed out, stop but be understanding, or what? because for me in this situation i literally felt awful haha and i want to know if guys would think of this as a big deal??

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: several years ago, before i was in my current relationship, i was that douchebag guy. i would have different women come and go. well one day i had two different women, let's call them **hannah** and **alice**, that wanted to come over and see me, one of which, **hannah**, i liked a lot. well normally i wouldn't have two girls over in the same day, to prevent any of the *seeing* and *meeting* each other, but i was full of myself. i told **alice** to come over early that morning so we could spend most of the morning together, but i had to go in to work early that afternoon.  i told **hannah** that i was working all morning but to come over later that afternoon and she could stay the night. 

well **alice** shows up around 7am, and of course, we screw around all morning. well **dumbass** me falls asleep, without setting an alarm. **alice** is asleep now too, thinking i'll wake her up when i have to go to work. well not *only* did **hannah** show up earlier than expected, she walks into my apartment without knocking, something she's does from time to time. i'm telling you, we really liked each other and had been talking for a while. *i just happened to like all the pussy too*. well what happens is this. i hear the truck, i *look* at the clock, and see it's a little passed noon. well **fuck fuck fuck**. i'm getting hot, nervous, my heart is sinking, i know i'm caught. maybe i can rush **alice** out the door before **hannah** can get put of her truck, *maybe* **hannah** will take her time coming inside. i wake **alice** up, say, ""*shit babe, i overslept, we've gotta go!* well **fuck me again**, she's butt ass naked and taking her *fucking* time getting her clothes on. **i am panicking**, and that's that. i'm freaking, and **alice** can tell. she thinks it is because i'm *late*, how cute. then i hear it, someone walking down the stairs outside my apartment. *my apartment was below the parking lot.* **hannah** walks in. a portal to hell opens, and shit goes crazy! if you want to know how to open a portal to hell, have two women you're fucking, meet. they both ask ""*who is this?*"" i'm not even speaking, my brain has shut down, i remember they are both screaming now, they'll start at me, and then they'll go  at each other. **hannah** starting to cry out of rage. this lasts for at least **10 minutes**, but to me it feels like forever. i want to lay down and die. **alice** finally just says *fuck you* to *me*  and starts to leave,  **hannah** says something along the lines of, ""*oh you didn't get enough?*"". i shit you not, **alice**, holding onto the front door, turns, looks at **hannah** and says, ""*no, i got plenty, i was just warming him up for you.*"", and leaves from my apartment and my life. **hannah**, still standing there in shock and tears, wants me to explain, wants some kind of explanation. well reddit, i'm fried, my brain has completely overloaded, i can't even speak. i'm just standing there like a fucking mental patient with the dumbest look on my face i'm sure. after what seems like forever, she finally just leaves.

**hannah** and i spoke a little after that from time to time. i still couldn't think of anything to say to make anything right. what was i suppose to say? i can't even think of anything smartass to say.  to this day, that was my biggest fuck up ever.

input: Text: this actually happened about a year and a half ago. my best friend and i im each other almost every day (we don't live near each other). this has been going on for about 10 years at the time, so, yanno, we're comfortable with each other. we make lots of really bad, off color jokes, all the time. he's also gotten me really good on multiple april fool's, so, yanno, sometimes i take what he says with a big grain of salt.

now, all i know at this point is that my friend, let's call him tim, is super clumsy. that's cool, i'm pretty clumsy myself, but he just seems to have a knack for getting into awful situations and mildly hurting himself. so i lovingly refer to his mishaps as ""timming"", and we kek mightily over this for years. it becomes one of our biggest inside jokes, to refer to accident prone people as ""tims"", or the act of being in one of these accidents as ""timming"". (i'd like to stress here that we'd never make fun of people in serious accidents. we're talking about small cuts, bruises, scrapes, that kind of thing.)

anyway, on this fateful day, he winds up tripping and falling and mildly hurting himself as he usually does. i worry over him of course, because i'm a good friend dammit, and whip out with ""why do you tim yourself so much?!"" i've asked similar things over the years and expect a good-natured ""i dunno"" or the usual off hand joke, but instead he tells me, ""because i have cerebral palsy.""

again, this dude and i, we've been chatting with each other for 10 years. i've stayed with him and his family and had a rockin' good time. we make horrible jokes all the time. this isn't even the most horrible of all of them, so i cackle and tell him that isn't a nice thing to say. ""muffinbutton, i'm serious."" ""lol kay."" (to be fair and to make me look like less of the asshole i'm quickly shaping up to sound like, he put a smiley face at the end of his sentence. how was i supposed to know he was being serious when he uses emoticons?!)

""muffinbutton, i have a mild case of cerebral palsy. there were complications when i was born. i had years of therapy to learn to walk right. i'm very lucky, but i still walk with a limp and don't have the best motor skills. that's why i fall over a lot and hurt myself.""

oops! i'll just be over here at the shovel store, buying a bigger shovel so i can dig the hole i've dug myself just a bit deeper!

the incident didn't change our relationship at all, and he admitted that me coming up with the whole ""timming"" thing made him feel a lot better about things but wow i felt like an asshole that day. i'm just happy to have such a good friend that didn't immediately block my stupid ass and has a great sense of humor.

input: Text: ah, there's a first for everything, including smoking. here's how my first smoke went:

it was a cold november evening at a house party and i was very drunk. i see a girl smoking outside and start a drunken conversation with her. we got onto the topic of smoking and she offers me a puff of her cigarette. me being inexperienced at that sort of thing politely took the cigarette and pretended to inhale. drunk people aren't great at being subtle and she saw right through my act and lightly teased me for it. 

so, i decided to take in the biggest puff my lungs could hold. i had vaped clouds before, how different could it be?

the answer was, very fucking different. the shock of all that smoke going down into my virgin alveoli immediately produced a reaction in the form of violent coughing and me dropping the cigarette inside the wooden decking of the garden, losing the cigarette. ah fuck, i had made a complete jackass of myself in front of this girl *and* lost her cigarette. oh well, time to go to back into the house.

5 minutes later i walk back outside and nearly shat myself. the cigarette i had dropped had turned from a tiny clump of embers into a plume of smoke and flame coming out between the holes of my friend's decking. shit. fuck. within a few minutes the whole deck would be on fire then my friend's house would be ground-zero within hours.

thank god for garden hoses and sober friends i guess, the next few minutes was a blur of water jugs and hosesprays all around the garden

input: Text: this is currently happening as i am typing this. 

every friday at our school we don't have classes and instead of classes we have year long projects. my friends and i decided to do some studies by using blue crabs and testing them in different environments. so today my friend walked in with a white 5 gallon bucket of baby blue crabs, there were probably 4 or 5 in the bucket. i was in charge of watching the crabs and staying with the bucket. this is all happening at lunch time and as the clock winds down i haven't gone to get my lunch yet. i am pretty hungry and had an extremely small breakfast. so i decide to place the bucket in the corner of the room and go and get lunch. 

i had a great lunch. the pizza that i had was fantastic so a+ lunch. as i return the 5 gallon bucket is gone from where i put it. i immediately go into panic mode and start running all over the school to find it. with the bucket no where to be found i rush to the front office and ask if they have seen it anywhere? they say they haven't. we then as a team of group and front office staff run around the school to find the crabs. again no luck. we then used the intercom which has only been used 2 other times in the existence of the school. once for a flood and once for a medical emergency. ""a group has lost a  gallon bucket of crabs if anyone has taken it or sees it pleas bring it to the front office. 

 


edit: here is the update no news from the thief. also haven't found them we are going in to school today on a saturday to tear the school apart to look for them. our school has a knack of putting things in the ceiling so this is the first place we are going to check. 


edit2: after yesterday's search we believe that a group of freshman took them.

input: Text: all right, so this just happened to me and i am so embarrassed. today's my birthday and my girlfriend and i were supposed to go out, but she had to pick up an extra shift at work, so we both decided to celebrate my birthday tomorrow. it was a boring night and i had nothing to do but stream netflix, so what's the next best thing? i decided to watch some porn to pass by time before i sleep. my roommate is gone for the weekend, so i was able to masturbate freely. as i was getting into it, i hear the front door open. i heard the voice of my roommate echoing through the walls. i was sure he heard my sexual moans. instead of stopping, i decided to continue masturbating making all these sounds. my girlfriend and i have sex all the time in my room, but my roommate doesn't seem to care too much, so i decided to let my roommate believe i was with my girlfriend. it's better than masturbating, right? all of a sudden, i heard a door slam. i dismissed it and continued to masturbate. 10 minutes later, i received a text from my girlfriend.
                                  
**girlfriend:** it's over

**me:** what?

**girlfriend:** i can't believe you...i was going to surprise you. i never want to see you again.

 5 minutes later, my roommate texted me...

**roommate:** that's messed up, man.

**me:** what did i do?

**roommate:** you had another girl in your room.

that's when i realized that my roommate and girlfriend thought that i was with another girl in my room. she's not responding to my texts.

 

**update:** wow, today is just not my day. it's also friday the 13th. i got a text back from her telling me that it was okay that i cheated on her because she also had a moment of weakness a month ago when she cheated on it. i don't know how to take this right now.

**update #2:** she cheated on me with my roommate. supposedly they were heading back to my place together to fuck. i told my roommate that i would be out with another friend celebrating my birthday for the night, so it looks like my roommate and girlfriend took the opportunity to fuck while i was gone. little did they know that i decided to stay home.

the reason it hurt my dad's feelings is because when i was a baby my mother left my dad one day while he was at work. she wrote a letter that explained how she was unhappy in their marriage and that she was taking my sister and i with her and moving ""home.""  my mother's home is the tiny island in the south pacific called guam.  my dad lived in colorado.  i did not meet my father until i was around 11 years old.  it wasn't my father's fault he wasn't there when i was growing up.  

a few years later while my dad and i were hunting, he had told me that i hurt his feelings that day and he hadn't forgotten. he knew i had not done it on purpose but it reminded him of all the time he missed out while my sister and i were growing up.

input: Text: not only did this happen today, i am 10 minutes beyond this experience as i write.

  let me start off by saying i get filthy at work. my skin is usually fifty shades of gray. 

   i get frustrated at work a lot. i come home stressed, and usually just want to sit on the porch and browse reddit for hours. there comes a time when my lazy ass finally says, ""ok, this is the last link i click"", and i head inside.
   so after my routine reddit sesh, i find myself in the shower. hot water feeling great, excited to get the filth off.  i can't stop thinking about what i'm going to have for dinner. things are just right with the earth. 
  i grab my bottle of axe body wash and my axe scrubber thingy, and i start to squeeze some jelly out of it.  i'm a little low. i gotta shake it a bit.
  fueled by the rage of the day, and the thought of not smelling like a black ice, i give it one last vicious shake (those real snappy shakes to get your money's worth) while letting out an affirmitive, ""oh, you fucking cunt!""
  i made sure to time the ""cunt!"" perfectly with the apex of my final, most ferocious shake to make sure all my rage was focused on getting those last drops of goo. 
   well, instead, i lost my grip of the oddly shaped bottle and flung it, full speed, directly into one of my testicles. i also then dropped the scrubby thingy, losing what remaining goo i managed to scavenge in the first place.
   i took a few seconds to gather myself. i then began to lather myself with shampoo. i was out of options.

so this happened about a week ago(insert song here). in my university, they had a welcome day. it was tempting to stay home but i decided to go to it.

now here the fuck up. 
under the chairs, they placed cards(you know like the one's to win a prize), so me unknowingly sat on one of those chairs. 

the card had a symbol that was unknown until later on. my mind was telling me to give it to a girl from my class but my mind said no.

later on, they said those with that card had to dance. my mind was fucked up. my heart started beating. so i walked up and had to chose a dance to dance to. i drawed it and it was...... watch me whip(or whatever the hell that dance is called).

so when it was my turn, i was one if the few people who didn't know how to dance to it. i was forced to do it as i couldn't drop out. while this was going in, the back of my neck was paining like *insert vulgar word here"" hell.

afterwards, the embarrassment screwed me over. i felt like crap. my mind was uneasy. after all this bs, they then said it was able to view on the school's website.

few days went by and i completely forgot about it then my cousin tagged me in the video. now my family will know about the fuck up.

last night i got shitfaced.  i bowl on thursdays, and my buddies and i usually enjoy a few beers, but i guess i felt like letting loose a little bit, and we were also getting some free drinks and shots from the wait staff. also, i had a designated driver, so everything fell into place to have a blast. 
i was shitfaced at that level where you can't really see anything, and what you can see looks like the milenium falcon jumping into hyperdrive, while also spinning in a circle. good times. 

i got home and stumbled into bed. the world was spinning, i was doing everything i could to avoid having to throw up. i know some people would rather puke and feel better, but i just have an aversion to it and avoid it at all costs. plus i didn't want to wake my wife up. 

fast forward to today. i of course woke up with a pretty nasty headache and some residual nausea, but i'm a grown up so a dragged myself out of bed and got to work on time. i was playing it safe. had a few bites of toast. alternated sipping water and gatorade, just trying to get things back to normal. i thought i had it under control.  

at 9 i had a meeting with my boss and a couple of other fellows, discussing a pretty exciting opportunity that's coming my way which includes a promotion and a pretty significant raise. my boss was sitting at the head of a rounded off conference table. i was sitting next to him on one side, so we were in fairly close proximity.  at some point, it started to hit me that i was not ok, and the hangover was making a strong comeback. i felt sick.  i tried to power through and pay attention, and i just kept hoping this meeting would be over soon, because i was pretty sure i was going to have to hurl this poison out of me.  finally, my boss asked me a direct question.  i turned to face him, and i opened my mouth to answer....and out of me erupted a wet death with the force of a fire hose. it was exactly like something out of a movie. it looked fake as it happened, when i see it in my memories, it still looks fake. i absolutely destroyed the man who is in direct control of my financial future. 

he left work to change and clean up. 4 hours ago. i still haven't heard from him.

input: Text: yea well, happened like 2 minutes ago.

im at my archery shooting range right now to do some training, since its one of those days its not raining, weird. so when i arrived i first made my way to the bushes next to the range to have a wee pee. there was this huge plant of nettles in front of me so by male instinct i had to pee on the leafs. very soon i would regret, because in a very fast pace the whole spawn of satan bend over right to my..yes. it rested his itchy leaf on my best parts. because i was in the middle of the act i could not just do a backflip or something, took me by surprise. 

so now my pantsnake is itching and i dont even know how im supposed to hold a steady bow, i hope it wears off soon. never even thought something like this could happen. it looks and feels like i caught a nasty std.

input: Text: i posted this 2 days ago but i didn't know about the no poop stories on weekdays thing. so here it goes again:

after a party today i was heading off home and just missed my train. no worries i'll just go to kfc to pass time.
i go up and order my zinger burger meal then sit down and start eating it. i'm looking at my phone and eating at the same time, once i finished i discover some bastard has left his twister, wrapped and all.


i give it a poke. hmm seems fine, just cold. seems like it was from around an hour ago. being the frugal, greedy fat cunt i am, i wait until the person next to me leaves and i go ahead and eat the twister. all i can say is, it was delicious at the time.


now i'm at the train station. that's when the immense stomach aches begin. but you know what i'm a tough guy and ain't letting no pussy ass aches stop me. the train comes and i get onto the train with no problems and the ache goes away.


then... 4 stops before home. my phone is about is dead and i'm reading the local newspaper which i found on the train.
boom. my ache is back. fuckkkk its so bad this time. my ass hole begins to let air out once every second to ease the ache.
3 stops from home.


gg there's no more air left in my bowels and i can feel poop edging out of my butt. the uneasiness is fucking unreal. i grab a few pages of the newspaper and shape it quickly into a nappy and stuff it in my underpants..


im pacing down the hallways now to stop my sphincter from failing me. the people on the other carriages can see me with my but clenched walking up and down the aisle.
1 stop from home.


holy fuck. you know how the closer you get to the toilet the looser your anus becomes. fuck me at this point i feel like a 60 year old slut who loves it up in hole #2. there has got to be a bit of poop in my hand made newspaper nappy.


this has got to be the greatest mental and physical challenge of my life. my whole body and mind is failing me at this point. but you know what i can do this,!!!


i clench my sphincter like i'm doing my last rep in my last set. it's the finale boys. you will be free soon mr brown.
the doors open to my train stop and bolt to the toilet. and fuck me am i a dumb cunt. it's fucking 2am of course the toilets locked.


but my anal muscles cannot handle the weight of my poop. i am this choice have no choice but to empty my bowels onto the grass right outside the station. it is the biggest shit i've ever taken and looks like 3kg of satay sauce from the local thai restaurant.
i cleaned my ass hole with the leftover newspaper and covered the poop with it and ran home where i'm currently recovering safely.


sorry to whoever is greeted by a giant pile of shit tomorrow morning at the station. i promise this will never happen again

** 

edit: i should mention i live in australia!!!

edit 2: just went back to the same station. can confirm the poop is still there, albeit dried up. looks like a circular piece of meatloaf now. it smells like total shit,  no one has cleaned it up and there are flies buzzing around.

input: Text: so this tifu did not happen today, although i just found about this subreddit from my brother when i told him this story. this happened two days ago.  
   
   so i walked into work this morning, and i was about 15 minutes early, so i decided to chill in the break room for a few minutes. as i sit down at a table in the break room, i spot the vending machine. what are the odds! i have a five dollar bill in my pocket! but the vending machine wont accept a five dollar bill for a one dollar beverage. i decide to hurry to another break room in another section of the hangar. (i work at an airport.) i go to the other break room which has a money changing machine. i skip to the machine and insert my five dollar bill. now, i was expecting to get five ones or even a few quarters. i was not expecting what happened next. the machine beeped, and then started spewing nickels. nickels! fucking nickels!!!!! 5 dollars in nickels is 100 nickels! i stood there, frozen, in front of a crowded break room. it was completely quiet, (except all those fucking nickels rolling around), and everyone was staring at me. i kinda just stood there for a few seconds, thinking it was a joke. but it wasn't. i quickly got down and grabbed all the nickels, shoving them into my pockets. everyone began to laugh. i ran out of the room, leaving a trail of nickels.  i walked around work clinking and jingling for the rest of the day. but i decide i already sacrificed so much for this gatorade, i will get this damn thing. so i stood in front of the machine putting nickel after nickel in. it takes forever but i do it. as im leaving work, i have to go through security. i beep and the security guard asks me to hold out my arms. i try to tell the man i have some loose change, but he just goes ""ok sonny but ima going to need you to hold out your arms."" (i live in the southern u.s.) he waves his wand around, gets to my hips and the wand beeps. he asks me to empty my pockets.  i start pulling out handfuls of nickels. the security people dont believe this, but i tell them what happened and they all started laughing. they said i could go through. so yes. that happened. it was one of the most embrassing moments of my life.

input: Text: not today but...

two weeks ago i went to a 3 day festival, a regional burning man event. fast forward to the day after the festy i went to a party at a friend's house and got extremely drunk. as soon as i came home, i passed out. 

i woke up a few hours later with the  very strong urge to take a piss. when i woke up, i woke up in a half-dream state and i thought i was still camping and i was in the tent. it was dark as fuck in my room. in my half-asleep and possibly still drunk haze, i then got out of bed, and started feeling around for the tent flaps. i eventually found the ""tent flaps"" but then tried to feel around for open space so i can find a nice spot to release my urine. couldn't find it, but i thought ""well, i'm outside of the tent, i'll just piss directly out of it."" and i started taking a leak. 

about 3 seconds into my stream, i then came to my senses. ""wait, i'm no longer at the festival. i'm at home... and in my closet"" and then stopped pissing and then found the restroom. my closet floor was pretty wet but i didn't fuck it up as bad as i thought.

it was embarrassing as fuck even though i'm the only one that knows about it, and now internet strangers do too.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: first, a little context for the story.  i am a 22 year old male and i just finished working that [pennsylvania farm show](http://www.farmshow.state.pa.us/), with 14-hour-days on my feet, 9 days straight.  i won’t mention exactly what my job was because it would be obvious who i was irl, but it involved making food and picking up heavy things fairly regularly.  

now, on to the fuck up.  due to the strenuous nature of my job, i had developed a sore, knotty back, so i decided that a nice long soak in the tub would probably do wonders for me.  i hadn’t taken a bath in probably 8 years, i just prefer showers.  so i get all set up; the perfect temperature, epsom salts, bubble bath, a nice bowl of weed… the whole nine yards.  anyways, as i’m sitting there, i need to reach out of the tub to grab the shampoo.  at this point, i was pretty high.  i reach forward at kind of an odd angle, and suddenly feel water shoot up my ass, catching me totally by surprise.  after the initial shock wears off, i think, “huh, i can probably clean my butthole like that”.  did i mention that i was high?

so i start shifting back and forth and, at first, it is working/feeling kinda good.  i guess i must have moved too forcefully, because all of a sudden, i shit myself.  i am so caught off-guard that i drop my bowl right into the tub.  so now have shit on me, shit floating in the bathwater, and my weed is gone.
  
i open the drain, turn the shower on and rinse myself off.  once the tub is empty, i see there is still some left in the tub, so i now have to clean that shit up.

input: Text: original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3o60y2/tifu_by_telling_my_girlfriend_that_i_masturbate/

*originally i posted this on tuesday but those darn mods wouldn't let me. it's fine now.*

okay, so like i said i went into school today and at lunch went to the library. she wasn't there this time around, so i went to the cafeteria.

now, i had gotten strange looks and some laughs earlier in the day, so i knew she had spread the word with my mastery to masturbate. 

when i went into the cafeteria, i saw her with her friends, so i decided to sit alone at the table across from her. i had no lunch as usual, so i simply stared at her for, say, thirty seconds before realizing i was being cringy so i went up and sat as close to her as possible.

immediately, her friends either giggled or called me nasty and told me to sit away from them, so i acted. i read every single comment, and i chose was i thought would be the most flattering and best plan by combining a couple of suggestions.

in front of all her friends, i said something like this:

""gf, i'm sincerely sorry for disgusting you. however, i want you to know that the very reason i chose to jack off to you was because i cared about you.""

i obviously wasn't that eloquent, but she was blushing, so i thought i was doing well.

""over all the naked women on the internet, i chose your body to lust to. i had hoped you'd think it's flattering.""

i was wrong about how i was doing.

""don't talk to me anymore"", said gf.

i was desperate, so i used what i learned from nofap.

""gf, i haven't jacked off to you in nearly a month. please, i do not jack off anymore. not in 25 days."" she ignored me.

i left, in defeat and shame. 

we're officially broken up and i'm now known as the fapmaster around school.

*edit* i'm fapmaster flash now. a lot of things happened since tuesday. this isn't the right sub for the story, though.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: background info: when i was around 5 years old, i had a rat named bob and he lived in one of those little glass aquarium/cages.  there is only one  bathroom that i could use back then (the other is attached to my parents room).  i also had no concept of how much small animals peed. 

one day my parents were having a party, and they said they weren't going to force me to mingle with their friends.  during the party i was hiding in my room when i realized i really had to pee, but i didn't want to make it known that i was home by going to the bathroom.  i ended up holding my pee for far too long and finally made a run for it, but there was someone in there.  whoever was in the bathroom must have been having some problems because they were there for a really long time.  meanwhile my bladder was about to burst, so i ran back into my room frantic, saw the glass aquarium and let loose.  bob immediately sought out shelter on top of his little house while his aquarium filled with over an inch of pee.  

after i peed in his cage i panicked, but then realized i had a perfect scapegoat... the rat.  i gathered up my courage, ran upstairs and told my mom that bob had an accident in his cage.  she was confused but came down to my room, along with a bunch of her friends.  as soon as everyone walked in and saw bob swimming around in an inch of pee i confidently said ""i think bob peed"".  everyone was able to come to the conclusion that that i was the one who peed in the aquarium and burst out laughing, i was absolutely mortified at the time.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i was walking home after work and, with it being friday, had planned to stop by the shop and grab myself a few drinks for the festivities later on. i waited in line at the cash machine to collect the rewards of my hard graft that week, or rather what was left of it after rent and bills had been stripped away. 

i don't know if it's common in other countries, but we would have some homeless people who would sit beside the cash machine and relentlessly beg ""change please"" at any one using the machine. i don't have a single coin on my being to buy their silence, and i'm lifting cash from the machine... i suspect it might be their game plan, but there is no way i'm passing on notes. so i stare blankly ahead, trying my best to put on my 'i've-had-a-tough-day' face on and faking deafness or letting on i'm zoned out, i'm never sure which. i get my money and go. i'm a bastard.

about 200 yards further along on my journey to home, i call into the garage. outside is a scruffy looking character squatting outside the window. the beggars don't usually come down these parts, but this one had the instrument that really tugs my heart strings. a dog. a dog, possibly some sort of terrier but i'm no dog expert, lying sprawled out in front of him. like the chaps lingering at the cash machine, i was aware of this guys plan (the dog) but this time, it was going to work. not only that, but this time i'd be coming out of the shop with change. i had the coins, he had the dog. i had also trailed a little bit of guilt with me from the previous beggar encounter. 

i purchased my goods, handed over my notes, and then, as predicted, my hand was filled with cumbersome change. but this time i had a plan. rid myself of guilt and loose change in a single arm movement. i don't know about other people, but i feel awkward passing change to homeless people. guilty when not doing it, awkward when doing it. am i giving enough? is this a tad condescending that i'm walking away with extravagant goods whilst dumping my change to this poor chap who has nothing but some clothes, a dog and a cup?

my plan was to walk out throw the change in the cup, maybe even recall my 'i've-had-a-tough-day' demeanor with a hint of '-but-hey-i'm-still-helping'. out the shop i go, avoiding eye contact, a slight bend of the knee to lower myself closer to the target and i drop 5-6 coins into the cup.

only there is an unexpected splash. it's not a begging cup, it's a cup of coffee. that i've probably just ruined. my face goes bright red (i can be an awkward guy). i freeze and am forced to make unwanted eye contact. 

after an eternity of 3 seconds, i cough (that's an acceptable apology right?) and hastily make my exit. i perhaps should have bought him a new coffee but i'm a cowardly bastard. i'm 95% sure he wasn't even homeless. but that my guilty mind had fashioned some scruffy bloke with his dog and a cup of coffee into the homeless person i could help.

  eventually the side of my driveway is filled with tire tracks and i take the long approach driving diagonally up the side.  this was my first mistake.  mistake number 2 was having the lull arm extended high into the air to keep the tree of the ground.  so i'm going up the side of the driveway and gravity decides to remind me, i can't do that and throws the lull onto it's side.  i don't know what i was thinking except here we go.  the lull starts flipping and i pull myself to the inside and hold on for dear life as i fall at the speed of a scene from 300.  the lull comes crashing down with glass shattering everywhere.
  i look up to see diesel spewing from the fuel tank overtop of me.  now i've seen one or two action movies so i think to myself, oh shit this is where the lull blows up and i die and the thought process was if i shut it off it won't blow up.  (i later learned that won't explode).  the front glass shattered in the crash so i was able to climb out.  i escaped unscavanged except a few cuts on my hands from the glass while crawling out.  sorry i'm not very good at telling stories or grammar, but i thought maybe one person would enjoy my tale.

input: Text: so in the turkish republic foreigners residing in the country for an extended period of time are required to get a residence permit.  today was my appointment.  this occurs at the fatih police station.

a lot of people have trouble finding finding the location within the complex where you turn in your papers.  in light of this, after i turn mine in i thought to myself, ""wouldn't it be useful to create a guide so other people could use it.""  why this guide should include some photos! 

so stupid me decides to act on this, at the time, brilliant idea and on my way out im merrily taking photos of landmarks to use.  since my appointment is late, (9pm) there is nobody around and i can take these photos unabated.  all is well until i get to the front and i take a photo of the building.  i get accosted by what i assume to be a non uniformed police officer and i tell him in turkish that i don't speak enough to understand him.  he takes me to a uniformed officer sporting an mp5 submachine gun and tells him the situation in turkish.  by now i realized i've made a mistake but i have no choice but to ride this rollercoaster until the end.

so since i realize my mistake and i already know what's coming next i hand the officer my device with the photos pulled up and i delete one making sure to show him the process.  he takes it and repeats the process for every photo while asking questions like, 

where are you from?
why are you taking photos?
why are you in turkey?
where do you study?
what do you study?

by this point i'm attracting a lot of attention from the other officers posted in front because there is literally nothing else happening other than cars driving by, it's really late like 9:45pm local time.  so every time another officer joins our new circle of friends i have to repeat my story.  by the end i'm encircled by 6 police officers armed with an assortment of automatic weapons including mp5 and m4 looking weapons that may have been hks since they already had mp5s.  

the last officer that joined our circle of friendship came up on my left and cut me off mid sentence and yelled,""dont panic, dont panic my friend.""  now, i dont feel like i was panicking, i could feel some adrenaline sure but even if i was panicking i feel like i was perfectly within my right to panic because i was encircled by police in a foreign country sporting automatic weapons after doing something very stupid.  

right before this the original english speaking officer asked if i took videos, i hadnt but he had to check anyway.  he watches a few of them, and scrolls through some like he had before with the pictures, at some point he was just admiring my collection, anyway he selects one more to play and this one happened to be me shooting a handgun at an indoor firing range.  so that didn't look good.

anyway, since the new guy joined i had to go through the gauntlet of questions again and this time at the end, kind of out of the blue, he asks if i know of [kevin mitnick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kevin_mitnick).  now, i did two internships at a defense contractor during high school after i performed well in a cyber security competition and at a time i trained to be a penetration tester.  so yeah, i know who kevin mitnick is we hit it off from there.  i had the fortune to take a cybersecurity centric tour of the pentagon before and i happen to have a cio.gov folder from that day that i used to carry all my residence permit shit.  it has a presidential seal on it and binary 1s and 0s aesthetically faded on the interior, they ooo'ed and aaahh'ed at it for a few moments and made polite conversation about hacking and firearms.  when i'm about to leave he says something about a photo and facebook, i didn't ask to clarify because i really wanted to get out of that situation since my fight or flight response was still active.  we exchange goodbyes in turkish after a few steps i say turn and say the equivalent of ""bye-bye"" in turkish and wave.  they respond the same as a group with a smile and i ran to cross the street.

it's weird to think had we been born in the same city we may have been best friends.

turns out i hit the gas and floored it. i went full speed into the back of some 50 year old guy in front of about 75 people. he sat there rubbing his neck the whole time while im sitting here getting yelled at by the person who worked there.

input: Text: i have to be to work everyday at 8:00 am. i do not need to clock in, but i am a contractor and it is really easy to get fired without warning. the commute is 20-45 minutes depending on traffic. anyway, the last time i drove my car i was too lazy to refuel my car and did not fill up before heading home. i completely forgot about this fact and this morning, after getting my morning donuts i looked at the gauge and the time.  the needle was on the empty and it was 7:41am.  i knew if i fueled up, i would definitely be late and get in trouble if not fired. if i chose to go directly to work, i risk running out of gas and being terribly late or simply getting to work on time.  i chose poorly.  

i did not want to run out of gas, so i decided to fuel up and be a couple of minutes late. i still rushed as fast as i could to minimize the time it took to refuel.  i prepared the words i would use while i was fueling up and on my way to work. refueling cost me 7 minutes. this would put me getting to work about 10 minutes late. it is not unheard of for traffic to set someone back that far, so i was prepared to lie, using that as an excuse. now 7:48 i drive as fast as i was comfortable with to get to work. apparently, i drove a bit too fast; i got pulled over by the cops. i could probably write some interesting dialog that sounds like some kind of a joke, but let's just say i was embarrassed. the cop gave me a $140 ticket for speeding and a court date to assess the damage i did to the fuel pump. in my rush, i left the handle in my gas tank and when i took off, i snapped the connector. fortunately, the handle of the pump was designed with dummies like me in mind and it snapped right where it could easily be repaired. i showed up to work an hour late this morning. i hope they will give me leniency since i have a citation to prove it was the cop that slowed me down.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened over the summer, but it was the most embarrasing situation i've ever been in. i'm a sixteen year old guy, but i'm pretty tall for my age, about 6'3.

anyway, my brother and his buddies decide to head out for a party that night. i had a date with a girl i really liked (an hour after the party started) and mum was out of town taking care of grandma after her knee surgery. i really wanted to start things off right with this girl because she was literally perfect. cute, smart, funny, and a little geeky like me. i got myself a new shirt and cleaned up nicely. i was ready for this.

my brother didn't want to come back and pick me up, so he took me with him. now my brother isn't the smartest guy and two weeks ago he bought this old, junky car that probably couldn't last more than six months. we were finding problems with this piece of shit literally every three days.

so i get into the car and buckle up. immediately, i knew something was wrong. the clip took a lot more effort to put in and it snapped closed when i finally pushed it in. i thought, no big deal, it's just old. my brother and his friends get in and i get to go to the party place. it's the middle of summer vacation, so everybody's outside and in the pool. the car (piece of shit that it is) doesn't have working windows, so it's almost 110 degrees inside. my brother and his friends get out of this heat and i go to unbuckle myself. that's weird. the button's not going down. i push the buckle again, a lot harder than i need to. nothing. the damn thing stays locked! i think, okay, i'll just extend the belt and pull myself out. nope. the belt is locked in place.

i was stuck in that car for the next sixty minutes. my tall, lanky body sweated itself out, and then boiled itself in that little metal box. but the smell...oh god the smell. i am not a person who has a problem with bad b.o, but the stench of that car baked itself into my skin.

i finally see my brother coming back. i'm sitting in the back, and he's basically carrying this other guy with him. he said something about vodka, and this dude was about as drunk as you could get. my brother basically dumped him into the seat next to me and got in the driver's seat to take me to my date.

at this point, i'm not sure why i still wanted to go. i probably smelled like the entire boy's locker room distilled into one teenage boy. we get to the fountain (where i was going to meet this girl), and this drunk turns around and throws up in my lap. this foul-smelling green concoction of guacamole, vodka, and stomach acid. right onto my new shirt and clean jeans. i sat there, shocked.

my date was already there and she was looking for me. i decide to just text her and call off the date. two seconds after i send her the text, i see her coming towards the car, looking like she was ready to kill me. keep in mind, this car's windows don't work. she tells me to roll down the window. i try to signal to her that the windows don't work and to go away(i didn't want her to see me with the dude or the vomit) but she looks shocked and starts crying. i told my brother to just drive home. he was just sitting there, laughing his ass off. as i later found out, my date had a crush on me for quite a bit of time, and i basically told her to get lost on what would have been our first date.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: hey, so, this happened yesterday but after it all i was too tired to do much but crawl into bed with food & netflix till i passed out so just be happy it happened this year, ok? awesome, shall we begin?

i'll start off by explaining i work in a museum as part of the education team which means i teach school groups most days. yesterday we had a school we weren't expecting show up (which doesn't happen often but still happens) but it was only one class so while another member of our team lead the group i spent most of the day getting on with preparing a presentation i have to give in a few weeks.

now we're a fairly laid back office on days like this & recently when i'm busy at home i generally have something playing on netflix in the background, so much so that i'm used to have background noise while i'm working on anything for a long period of time, so i spent most of yesterday working on my presentation with 'scrubs' on in the background. 

most days i work from 9-4 but on tuesdays i finish at 3 because i have to get from work to a brownie unit i've been helping with but that's currently on hold however i still planned to leave early as i had two flat viewings that evening with bob (the fiance mentioned in previous posts), one at 4:30 & one at 5. now at lunch time bob rang me to say he wasn't well & wouldn't be able to make the viewings, so i rang & cancelled the 4:30 one as it was a secondary viewing booked because he got held up at work last week & couldn't make it there last week & it seemed pointless viewing it alone again but we decided i should go to the other one & report back if it was any good. i told him to go to bed & get some rest then had some lunch before getting back to work.
i keep working on my presentation, 'scrubs' happily playing on in the background & before i know it, it's 3 o'clock. now usually i'd be out like a shot (not that i don't love my job but that office gets really hot & stuffy) but i'm doing well with my work & it won't take me two hours to get to this flat so i decide to get a drink then stick around till half past instead, not so long that i'd be late but long enough to get a bit more work done & one more episode of 'scrubs' to play, seems like a good plan, don't you think?

so i keep going till half past, i save, shut down, sign out & head for the bus stop. the bus is late of course, as usual but it eventually turns up & i get on & start my way to this flat. i get into town at about quarter to & worry i might be a tad late so i ring the estate agent to let them know just in case then head off to get the bus that will take me closer to where i need to be. this bus is also late but i get on & at 4:59 i am sitting in my seat on the top deck, waiting for us to move when suddenly another bus comes up to pull in at the stop just in front of the one my bus is at. 

now this particular street is part of a busy bus station that also allows general traffic, so at times this street can be packed with vehicles & clearly this particular bus driver doesn't have the patience to wait for anyone else to move so he can pull in & he obviously thinks that there's enough space for him to get past...he's almost right, almost. 

for a moment he glides past with ease then suddenly there's a horribly loud, wrenching, unfamiliar noise that sounds a lot like something breaking & quite a few people seem more than a bit concerned with the events unfolding outside of our bus. after about a minute or so we hear the inevitable sentence ""you'll have to get off & wait for the next one""...shit. we all pile off & only then to we see what's really happened, the moving bus has almost made it but for that darn protrusion at the front of our bus known as the wing mirror...which is now in two parts, the arm lying on the ground, abandoned by the actual mirror which is now residing on the dashboard inside the bus, a hitherto unexplored area now accessed due to the window now broken & spread across the road. the bus that was moving also has a broken window at the back (really hope no one was sat there at the time, there didn't seem to be anyone hurt thankfully). i look at this scene as anger flashes briefly through me, soon replaced by acceptance at my shitty luck, why am i surprised? i take out my phone to call the estate agent 

""sorry, i'm going to be later than expected, my bus was just hit by another bus"" 

""oh, wow, well we can wait around for you but we have to have the keys back at the office by half past so if you make it by twenty past you'll only have a few minutes to look around, you'll have to hurry, see you soon""

...shit. the time is now 5:18 & i'm trapped in the back corner of a completely packed single decker trying to hold everyone who just got off the double decker, panicking that when i get there a, i won't be able to get off because of all the people & b, the estate agent will have gone already.

at 5:25 i squeeze my way off the bus, apologizing to everyone i have to push past on my way, & run from the stop round the corner, following the dot on my phone & praying she's still there...she is, thank god! & after all that effort? it's not really that great, not what i was expecting & definitely not what bob & i are looking for, oh well, such is life, guess we'll just have to keep looking, eh?

input: Text: met this girl in a nightclub, seemed fairly into me from the get go but playing a little hard to get. club closes and she's basically sticking with me the whole time. she's with a couple of friends but says she lives on the other side of the city. we goof around for a while in the city and get with each other a few times then eventually get the metro towards her place. 

we get off the metro and her and her friends all just randomly leg it. i follow for a bit, and they just laugh and keep running. turn a few more corners and they are gone. now i'm on the other side of the city and its 4am...$40 taxi back to where i've come from.

i've had games played before...but really would you drag a guy halfway across the city just to run away and see his reaction?!

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i like hats. particular now that i'm going bald and need to protect my dome from the sun. but a hat can give a person character also. personally, i like stetsons, barmahs and panama hats. the gambler hat looks cool too but the undertaker pretty much killed the look for me from overuse. i even like the original federas - not these newer clown hats without a brim, many of them here being sold in tourist stores. 

right now i own a straw western type hat. it's not your atypical hat unless you are a mexican landscaper or do other work activities in the sun. underneath this, because i have a bald head, i wear a bandanna to keep the itch away, and to help keep my head cooler. 

today,  i wanted another hat. one with a bit more character than this straw hat. i want a barmah. i've been wanting another one for a while actually. i have had one in the past, though that one may not have been an original, it still did well. 

i charted a few hat store locations via google maps and knew of 2 from my past purchase of a barmah. all of these locations were on ""the strip"" in las ridiculous . right now i don't have a car so i'll be walking. the strip's not that far anyway. so i dressed for comfort and went out the door.

i've forgotten how hot it gets in vegas. at 12 pm at the start of my adventure,  it was already reaching 100. but that's ok. living here, i've learned to always bring water, no matter if it's just across the street, or across the desert. i have ran an average of 3 to 5 miles 3 times a week. but not in heat like this. the strip was about 5 miles away. on the way i made a few stops for more water. 

the first destination, the store didn't exist, nor did the second, or even the 3rd. in the process, i have walked the entire strip and back. and because of my running experience chose to run up and down steps instead of waiting on escalator tourists. 

my last hope was in the venetian. i had already past it because the old hat shop was in front nearby, but was no longer there, but the maps showed one near here. fuck it, i'll try the forum shops. they are a kind of upper class kind of place, specializing in name brands  and such. it really is the best place to have a name brand hat shop.

this place is huge! i was wandering around and seeing a lot of food court, so i figured it to be a good time for a restroom stop and to fill my bottle. then i found a cool shaving place and was a bit timid going in because i didn't really bring enough money for all that. after looking at a few creams and double edges, i basically stated, ""na, i better go before i start buying everything "" 

thinking back. this may have been the point that put me under radar.

i was still searching for this supposed store. if it exists. i checked the map but nothing popped out at me. i seen a group of security that i passed and turned around and asked them. one pointed me in a direction stating ""keep right"" 

""oh cool. how did i pass it?"" 

walked a ways staying on the right, past another fork because there didnt seem like anything down there. but didn't see anything else none the less. fine. lets try this other direction anyway.

 at that corridor, there now existed a big beef of a guy, dressed much differently than the other security.  he looked the part of 3rd world soldier minus the cigar and machine gun. and he was looking at me. but whatever, not my concern, though i noticed him turn in the same general direction as i went, but much more slower.down this corridor on the right was a restaurant, on the left i don't even remember. maybe a small gift shop, and in front of me was the exit. nope, nothing this way. i must have missed it again somewhere. i started back down the corridor while seeing this cuban dictator staring me down and started angling to stop me before i passed.

oh. fuck. i just realized i gone goofed. i was quite unshaven, and my shirt had a hole in it and probably looked like shit from all the sweat and salt of the day, and running up and down stairs. i also happened to be in need of new shoes. i definitely looked the part of the homeless man which are literately everywhere on the strip these days. 

""whatcha looking for?"" 

myself: ""oh, i am looking for a hat shop that's supposed to be in here or around the venison.""

""i think you have the wrong cassino.""

i took the hint. even if there was a hat store, they didn't want what appeared to them as homeless in their shops.

myself: "" oh ok, thank you""

feeling dejected i decided to walk back home.

10 waterbottles later and back home, i now understand why they call them sweatpants. i literally sweated in them the entire time. sitting down was not fun. i had a huge heatrash from my ass crack to the entire sack of my balls which burned like hell. it also felt like i went through leg day. probably because of those steps.

input: Text: so this happened earlier this week at my university where i was running a bit late for my lecture. right outside the classroom there were two people fighting, a young lady in her late twenties and a man of about 40. the woman was clawing for the man's eyes and screaming ""kill him! kill him!"". the man was trying to pin her arms down and control her.

instead of intervening i walked up to them and asked if they wanted help. i was directing this to the man since people were standing around and one was calling for police. neither the man nor the woman replied and i continued in to my class. later when police came to the scene and i learned that the student had been banned from the school and had attacked the lecturer when he told her to leave it felt really silly that i hadn't helped him restrain her. it struck me much later how bizarre it was to ask two people fighting ""hey do you want some help?""   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

input: Text: literally just happened less than 15 minutes ago.
i decided to fry some breaded pork chops in my cast iron skillet. i get the oil to a nice hot 375 degrees and place my pork chops one at a time into the oil.

here's the laziness part of my fuck up: i go into my utensil drawer and there's only one clean fork left in there. i probably should have just gone into my dishwasher and cleaned a second fork for dining and used one for cooking, but like i said i was being lazy.

so, i cook the first pork chop to satisfaction and take it out of the oil. i am also hungry and start cutting open the pork chop after i put the second on in the oil. after flipping the second chop (using aforementioned only fork) i go back to my already cut up chop, and immediately take a piece to bite. of course, i didn't consider waiting a minute or so for the fork which i was just swishing around in the hot oil to cool down.

i now have a fork shaped second degree burn in the corner of my mouth and on my lips; but damn are these pork chops tasty.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: long time lurker, first time poster. like most this f up occured quite a few years ago. almost 9 to be exact, the day before my 16th birthday. 

so i decided to hang out with my younger sister, and her two friends, one of which was a guy about her age. she is only a few years younger than me. we decided to head to this wooded part of a subdivision down the road the road from our house on bikes, its almost right acrossed the road from our local bmx track and there was a race going on at the time. 

being the younger rebels that we were, most of us had already picked up the habit if smoking so i always had a lighter on me. so not thinking about what could happen or the consequences that could happen after that. we started usong the lighter to light some pine needles on fire, i used it the first time and lit a small fire, seeing how quickly it spread i put it out. i was the oldest in the group and had more common sense than the other 3 even though it wasnt very much more.

so my sisters guy friend had asked to see my lighter, and of course being the dumbass i was, i let him use it. well he used it on a small fallen pine tree that happened to have a bunch of dead needles on it. the fire started to get pretty big so when i went to put it out he had stopped me and said wait a couple more seconds. i have no clue why i listened to him because in that couple seconds the fire became so unmanageable. our first instinct was to throw dirt on it, well thats wasnt quite working. next thing you know this fire is spreading acrossed this pine wooda quickly. 

so we did the next logical thing, because we didnt want to see any nearby homes catch fire, we called 911. at this point, this kid is panicking, talking about how he will get in so much trouble blah blah blah. i felt bad for him, he was a few years younger than me so i told him to take his bike and head home and i would deal with the police and firefighters even though mind you, he is the one who started that fire. i was already on juvenile probation at the time so i figured what else could it really hurt. later, did i find out it really couldve hurt alot. so he takes off for his house as quick as possible. 

next thing you know the police and firefighters show up and while the cops talking to me filling out a police report, the firefighters put out the fire. i told the cop that i had started the fire. he takes me and my sister home and tells my mom that i was lucky that i wasnt a day older or he would've taken me straight to juvenile detention.  

i almost got hit with a felony arson charge for that but my probation officer helped me get it down to a misdemeanor of unability to contain a fire and extended probation for six more months and i also had to take a couple fire safety courses courtesy of the fire department.

this just happened 10 minutes ago.
i have a propane torch i played with outside and melted some snow  outside our garage port and i decided to melt something more that just snow with it.

so i got this big chunk of maybe 50 grams of tin that i put on in jar lid and melted. the lid was surrounded by snow since it melted through the snow down to the ground.
so i decided to move the lid a bit to make it lay more even and not risking to tip over.
and now i really goofed, i accidentally tipped the lid too much so the tin poured down on the snow.
pop! and since i was crouching over the tin splattered right all over my face.

input: Text: today, at the gym, i was having a wonderful morning with a red bull and a bench press. the way my gym is set up, there is a leg press machine where your back is kind of to the ground at a 45* angle and you push up with your legs as the weight comes down at you, almost like an inverted squat. i'm sure most of you have seen this machine before. to its right, there is a chest butterfly machine, and to its left, there is a curling machine. on the curling machine was a 30-40 yr old guy. on the leg press is a 20-25 yr old girl. as i was saying about the machines, the girl's face is about 2 ft lower than the guy's face since the leg press has you basically laying down. 

  i was sitting up waiting to start my next set while something awesomely bad happened. mid-curl, the older male turned his head to his right and sneezed right onto the younger gal. i saw projectile. in my mind i even felt the mist landing on her. i'm listening to cypress hill by the way. i took off my headphones to see this play out. the girl shrieked and then started to cry. the guy said he was sorry and walked away embarrassed. for some reason, i walked to the disinfectant, sprayed it on a paper towel and tried to hand it to her to maybe wipe her arms or something. she looked at me and said, ""and what the fuck is this going to do?"". she then took the paper towel spit on it and wiped it on my arm. then said,""there, now your clean right?"" 

  luckily, one personal trainer saw this. he told her to leave and that i was just trying to help.

input: Text: so this didn't happen today, but it was over thanksgiving break in 2012. i lived in south lake tahoe, california, and my parents live in wisconsin. to start the story, i used to be prescribed a large amount of benzodiazepines (klonipin and xanax), as well as live in a city where marijuana is more than acceptable, and on the border of nevada so there are a dozen or so casinos just a few minutes away. if anyone has drank while taking xanax or any other type of benzo, you know that it is a recipe for blacking out, and often disaster.  in my infinite wisdom when i was 22 years old and in the middle of a xanax blackout, i decided to bring a quarter ounce of weed in my carry-on bag that i was packing for my trip home the next day. fast forward to a day later, my girlfriend is dropping me off at the airport in reno, nevada (the closest large airport) and i have taken so many pills that i can barely say goodbye, let alone walk myself into the airport and go through security. i didnt check a bag so all i had was my carry-on, and somehow i made it through security completely fine. i have about 40 minutes before my flight leaves at this point, and i decide to get a drink at the airport bar. i start talking to someone and lose track of time after a couple beers and i hear my name being announced over the loudspeaker. i had almost missed my flight, and i hurried to get on the plane. up until this point everything was fine and i was on my way home. i had a connecting flight in minneapolis that take me on the final leg home. after the flight takes off, i take a couple more of my 2 mg xanax and proceed to order some beers. i dont remember exactly how many beers i had on the plane, but it couldn't have been more than 4 or 5 . this combined with 20 plus milligrams of xanax caused me to go into a deep sleep. somewhere during the flight i passed out, however when it came time to get off the plane, no one could wake me up. i was breathing, but basically in a drug and alcohol induced coma. the police were called and they had to basically carry me out of the airport. the last thing i vaguely remember is walking out of the terminal with a police officer on both sides. the next morning at around 5 am i woke up, with both arms restrained in a hospital type bed. i immediately screamed, and a nurse came and untied me. i asked what happened, they informed me of the events, said they had talked to my dad and he had rescheduled my flight for later that morning, handed me all of my stuff along with a police report and my new plane ticket and told me to be on my way. i had a short walk to the airport from the hospital, and i began reading the police report. i had completely forgotten about the weed that i had in my backpack, and the police had found it. in the report it said that they found a container with ""medical marijuana"" in it, along with my empty bottle of prescription pills. they took the bud, but somehow i managed to escape that situation without any tickets or criminal charges. my family was extremely worried and disappointed when i didn't show up as scheduled, but in the end everything worked out.

 i have been so lucky multiple times in my life, and i thank god that i know better than to do this type of this now. i don't know if i ever actually got arrested either, this whole memory is kinda a blur for obvious reasons. my dad still has the copy of the police report that i was handed after this all happened. maybe i will ask him for it soon and post it if anyone is interested. i also have 2 or 3 other stories that involve me getting extremely lucky, i might post them later separately.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: obligatory ""this happened a while ago.""

it's my sophomore year in hs and i'm trying my best to make friends and not let my social awkwardness get the better of me. i had this crush on a girl who we'll just refer to as sarah. i managed to finally get her to come to the mall with me and we actually have a pleasant time. but about an hour in we pass by a makeup shop... sarah, of course, gets this wonderful idea that it would be just amazing if she could do my makeup here. my awkward teenaged mind wasn't throwing any red flags, so i accepted. i'm in that shop for almost a full half an hour and she's finally doing the finishing touches on my previously ok face. she insist i don't get to see what i look like until we're done. but i already know what i look like. i see people staring from the main hall outside the store. i was socially adept enough to know that the faces people were making meant that i... looked... bad.

now that we're done with adding makeup to my face, i'm dying to get it off already. i look like the lead singers from kiss and slipknot had a cosmetic breakdown on my face. i legitimately looked like one of those troubled teens going through ""that phase,"" except to an extreme extent. now she's making me walk all around the mall. my mind is yelling at me to make her take it off, while on the outside i'm trying to nonchalantly walk with my friend like nothing's wrong. she has to use the restroom, so i get the pleasure of waiting outside facing everyone in the hall. i child looks at me, then to his mother he ask, ""mom why is that man so scary."" thankfully the mother didn't say anything, i might have collapsed in tears. sarah comes back out from the restroom, and i'm begging her to take it off. i become a bad friend for making her take my makeup off, thus ruining everything i worked towards getting on her good side. seriously, fuck the way everyone's mind worked at that age.

now we walk back into the makeup shop from earlier and an old friend of sarah's sees her. they we're about to make a quick exchange of greetings but then, she saw me. she quickly takes me to the back and does her best to remove/cover all of my makeup. she had already figured out how i got in this mess, because little words were exchanged between us and she had acted so quickly. she had basically told me not to do this to myself, which i made sure i haven't done since.

 

this fucking sucked and had it happened more recently, probably would have been recorded. thanks for reading, and i hope this'll make someone's day. also apologies if formatting is crap from my mobile.

input: Text: so to give you an idea of my surroundings, i have a small desk with a few things on it. there's an ethernet cable strung around the front of my desk to my dvd player since it's a hassle to get it around back and it was only temporary. there's also one of those plastic things you put on the floor to keep messes off of the carpet. there isn't much room left for my tea, so i just set it beside me, which happened to be in front of the cord.

i really had to use the bathroom, so i got up to do so and as the genius i am i start walking and trip over the cord. the router/modem thingie (i think it's both in one, but i'm not 100% on that.) falls over and my tea topples off the desk. at this point i'd like to mention that the glass i was using was big as hell. it was probably 24 ounces and about 2/3 full, so as you can imagine it was a mess. when it fell it also went all down my pants and off of the plastic carpet protector thing. lucky me.

the towel closet is right next to my room.my mom is in the living room in clear view of my room, so i sneak out and get a towel as quietly as possible. mission accomplished. i go back to my room and start wiping up the sticky, stain-making sweet tea. at this point my mom comes in here to hand me some papers for school. she, of course, sees me vigorously wiping the (surprisingly not stained) carpet. she asks me what the ruckus is about and i just mumble answers because i'm ashamed of how stupid i was. i guess she mistook it for passive-agression because she got pissed and walked off. now i'm just sitting here writing this with yet another glass of tea. wish me luck in not doing something dumb!

anyway, in my excitement, today i sent a girl a message saying only: 'netflix and chill?' she says yes, and comes over. yeey, finally a real world meme coming to life outside of the us. she comes over, we fool around, have a good time.

now, my understanding of 'netflix and chill' is just  a hookup. wasn't looking for anything else, don't really have the time. as she leaves, i walk her to the bus station, and by the time i get back, i see a relationship request in my facebook notifications. so as much as i thought she was familiar with a lot of memes, obviously i misplayed.

okay, so i'm on my school group. there's 49 students on it. i meet them nearly everyday. i've never sent anything on it, nor am i social irl. i'm the guy that sits in a corner doodling, avoiding social contact.  

anyway, today, i decided to break my virtual silence. the topic of conversation was one of our dickhead teachers, who happens to be a muslim. a dude cracked a mildly offensive muslim joke and i don't know why, it made the light bulb in my head shine bright. you see, i'm the guy that loves dark humour, and i often spend hours on /r/imgoingtohellforthis and on 4chan, so i have a wide array of offensive jokes. i think 'fuck i gotta send this shit to them. they'll think i'm hilarious!', forgetting that there's stupid religious people in my class who quite obviously won't find it funny.  

anyway, i post this (http://imgur.com/4mfljjq). it doesn't exactly settle well... i start freaking out. i still am freaked out. there's a guy who thinks this joke is racist? huh... normally, i'd call him a foolish mango; seeing how islam is a religion, not a race, but at that moment i felt strangely apologetic. basically, i just went batshit crazy in my irrational freak out period and apologised for something that i wouldn't usually apologise. everyone thinks i'm even weirder now. great. i'm contemplating on being a professional hermit now. i definitely have social anxiety.

input: Text: so this fuck-up happened literally 30 minutes ago. 

for the past couple weeks, my mom has been meticulously planning a surprise birthday party for my sister, whose birthday is in late march. my sister loves surprises and my mom is trying to be extremely secretive about this party in order to really catch my sister off guard. my mom doesn't let anybody discuss details of the party while my sister is in the house and even created a fake email account to plan the party, just in case my sister somehow sees my mom's emails and discovers the surprise. as you can tell, my mom is really serious about this surprise party and wants to it to be a mind-blowing experience for my sister. as a result, my mom as booked a popular dj, a fashion lady (or something like that - i don't know the actual title) to give all the girls at the party make-overs and whatnot, as well several expensive birthday presents. the next step for my mom was to discreetly invite a bunch of my sister's friends (i think about 10-15 in total) by sending an email (using the fake email account) to each friend asking if they are available to attend the party.

here's where i get involved: 

i'm on facebook today looking at pictures and scrolling through my news feed just like any other day when one of my friends suddenly chats me. 

him: ""dude i got a weird email from your mom. i think she sent it to the wrong person.""

me: ""oh really? what is it about?""

him: ""it's an invitation for some girl named samantha to attend your sister's birthday or something. how did your mom even get my email address?""

me: ""hahaha. that must be for my sister's surprise birthday party. i have no idea how my mom sent *you* that email though. i'll go ask her.""

immediately after this conversation i try to ask my mom why she sent my friend that email. so usually when i try to ask my mom for something and she is in the living room and i am on the second floor of my house, i just yell really loudly to get her attention. so, without thinking, i scream, ""hey mom! why did you send an invitation to *friend's name* for *sister's name*'s party? i think you meant to send it to samantha!"" while i was so caught up in why my mom sent my friend that wrong email, i didn't realize that my sister's room was right next to where i was standing. i take a peek inside the room (somehow hoping that my sister didn't hear what i had just yelled) and much to my dismay, my sister is sitting on her bed where she was definitely able to hear everything that just happened. 

oops. needless to say, but my mom was pissed.

i pull up to her house and i'm feeling very confident. this is her parents house, so i'm not going inside, but i'm certain i can at least get some hot smooch action before i go. she thanks me for the ride and then we stare at each other for a few seconds. i decide to go in for the kiss slowly, real smooth-like. our lips meet and there is a single moment of sexiness before a loud bang and our heads jolt forward. turns out i hadn't put the truck in park, so when i leaned in for the kiss my foot was removed from the brake, resulting in me slowly rolling into the back of her dads car. 
her dad then came outside in his pajamas, yelled at me, assessed the damage (thank god there was none) and sent me on my way. i drove off in my tiny sad truck and never heard from her again.

input: Text: first things first - i am usually against using herbicides and/or pesticides for home lawncare. last july, however, i needed to fill some cracks in my driveway. the only problem? dandelions were growing in the cracks. so, like any honest son of a pei homeowner, i found an old container of concentrated weedout and went to work.

conveniently, the container had a built-in spray nozzle attached to a tube - no need to tilt it and risk spilling it anywhere. if i'm going to use herbicide, might as well minimize the impact, right? so i happily sprayed each and every dandelion i saw in the driveway. great! there's still half the bottle left for next year! so i put the container on a shelf in the shed, washed my hands, and forgot about it.

today, i opened the shed and looked at the shelf. the nozzle was sitting on the shelf next to the mostly emptied container - fuckfuckfuck - surrounded by a sticky puddle of half-crystallized weed killer. i figured out that the tube had still been full when i put it away - the container acted as a siphon, emptying itself out. now i can look forward to cleaning up some carcinogens tomorrow :|. so much for minimizing spill damage.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i was riding the bus home this morning after working a 12-hour night shift without much sleep before work. i did what i usually do on the ride home, which consists of alternating between passing out and waking up every thirty seconds or so. for some reason the combination of falling asleep and the vibrations from sitting over the rear wheel of the bus commissioned a rigid, throbbing, leaning tower of mushroom meat in my pants. i woke up after a middle aged, southeast asian lady occupied the seat next to me, her legs awkwardly touching mine and her breast rubbing against my arm with every pothole as we shared a seat in the confined rear corner of this stinking vessel for the disabled and vehicularly challenged.   
  
i panicked. my stop was approaching and i was battling a trouser dragon which i could not slay. her unintended grinding and the bumpy road certainly did not help my cause. i considered riding the bus all the way around town until my man steak returned to medium rare, but this was not an option as i had to be home to let my girlfriend in, who did not yet have a key to the apartment.  
  
so i pressed the button to signal the driver to stop, planning in detail how i would exit the bus without alerting my fellow passengers to the angle of my dangle. i would put my backpack in front of my junk, stand up, and walk out the back door. the perfect crime.  
  
**where i fucked up:** as i stood up, i dropped my bag. no fear, i thought, her satellites haven't detected my surface-to-air missile yet, i will just bend over and pick up my knapsack and carry on. so i did, i bent over, inadvertently tucking my cock rocket back behind my legs. as soon as i retrieved my back pack and stood up, i noticed she was getting up from her seat. too late. wrong place, wrong time, one inch too far. in a cruel twist of fate, the instant she arose from her seat, my beef torpedo launched from between my legs and slapped her square in the jaw. fucking track pants allowed maximum velocity, too. nothing but jeans from now on.   
 
  
i was off the bus and running for my life before i had a chance to witness the look of horror that was undoubtedly pasted on her face. i am never riding that bus again. *never.*

input: Text: okay, so i have just created an account after lurking and getting schadenfreude from posts here, it is only fair that i return the favour. 

i work at a supermarket in new zealand as a grocery assistant, nothing fancy but it pays the bills for now. a big complaint i have about my uniform is that it is not well suited for physical work, the trousers are especially inflexible which results in tears down the seam of the pants. i have been fed up with resewing time and time again and have elected to use a few safety pins threaded through the split to keep my trousers together until i can be bothered fixing them.

so, work as usual yesterday and i am walking back to where i am working, and i decided to walk through the least crowded aisle, which contains snack foods on one side and baby needs and wax, condoms and lube on the other. there are only a couple of young guys down there, i'd guess mid twenties, and when i get closer i see that they are a couple, no big deal to me. they take little notice of me and are looking at the lube. as i pass them however, my pants feel a bit weird, they are moving just slightly strangely on me and that is when i feel one of the safety pins stabbing into my upper inner thigh and i yelped ""jesus that hurts!"" whilst clutching that backside of my trousers and limping off, only to look back at them to see if they heard me out of mild embarrassment. i was not even thinking about what it looked like, until i saw one of them scowling at me, his partner merely nonplussed with the lube in his hand. i turned back the direction i was heading in disbelief at what i had just done and feeling absolutely awful. 

so yeah, i would say i fucked up.

""i'm sure w thinks its ok"" that in hindsight was a bit of a stretch. ""you are in my bed, that means you want it"". i could only think that she would hate me if i said no. so i caved in. i did enjoy it (she is gorgeous, has a great body, stamina, and is quite talented). i remember feeling that i had to keep focusing on pleasing her, i couldn't focus on myself. after a few hours of that we went to sleep and the next morning i was kinda still drunk. i want sure if i was feeling a hangover or regret the next day. i haven't told w yet. i don't know how. we are all supposed to hang out in a few weeks. i guess i feel really guilty and dumb for getting myself into a situation i couldn't back. i fucked up. i'm a dick. i kinda hate myself. lay it on me.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this actually happened sunday, but started about a week ago. i woke up at 3am with severe pain in my chest and left arm. my first though was ""shit, i'm having a fucking heart attack!"". i'm 44m and takes meds for anxiety, so my second thought was that a panic attack or stress made a lot more sense. i grabbed my phone and googled the symptoms, and panic attack did fit. i had no other symptoms. wasn't sweating, no shortness of breath. no rapid heartbeat. it went away after about 20 minutes, and i went back to sleep.

a few days later i decided to walk on my treadmill and after 3 minutes i had some mild chest discomfort. it quickly went away with rest, so i called and made an appointment with my doctor on thursday. ekg was normal. he assumed stress, but was a bit concerned that pain came back with activity. we scheduled an appointment to see a cardiologist for monday. 

on saturday night at bedtime i had pain again, but seeing as the ekg was normal, i ignored it. same thing sunday, but figured i'd go to the er and get another ekg just in case. that one also looked normal, but after checking the one from thursday they noticed a ""subtle difference"" and decided i needed to be at a bigger hospital. 

i arrived at that hospital at 1am monday morning. by 9am i had a stent in the left anterior descending artery (also known as the ""widow maker"") of my heart due to a 95% blockage. the cardiologist and nurses all said i was lucky to be alive, and had i waited i likely would have had a heart attack. due to where the blockage was, that would have killed me before i could have gotten medical help.

input: Text: this happened when i was fifteen. for background i grew up in hickville, usa and the high school i went to was crazy. about 95% of the guys chewed (really dipped as everyone had copenhagen rather than redman) tobacco or smoked. people were showing up drunk on the daily. people got expelled for bringing guns onto campus so they could sell them (this was after columbine and newtown, and shame on the school's administration for not locking down the school each time they knew about it).  almost everyone carried knives. i was in the majority that used tobacco. around that time i was dipping like crazy. 

the night before the fuck up i was caught by my dad (an essentially straight edge man who rarely drank and never smoked anything in his life) while i had a massive dip in.  i swallowed the fat dip i had in so naturally i threw up (i couldn't stomach it at all) a lot. i had just gotten three cans of grizzly that day and didn't want to waste them. so the next morning i faked being sick so i could stay home as i didn't sleep that night.  

so onto the fuck up. i decided to get rid of the cans by dipping them off quickly rather than throw away two and a half cans of wintergreen flavored cancer. i got through the half can and had the biggest nicotine buzz of my life. i then open the second can and put one in while resisting the urge to vomit as at that point me and wintergreen weren't friends. a few minutes later i put another in. i repeat until half of can #2 is gone. 

i then get the familiar gagging and run to the bathroom. i managed to lose half of my stomach acid as i hadn't eaten anything. i got up and was really fucking dizzy, like the house is spinning  at 50 miles an hour. my heart was racing and i was shaking so a lot.  my stomach hurt a lot and i felt like i was still going to vomit. i then went into my room and sat down for a bit. i still felt like i was going to pass out. i got up and laid on the clothes strewn across my bedroom for about an hour. i didn't move aside from the shaking and it still felt like the house was spinning. i ended up blacking out for twenty minutes or so.

i got up and went to the living room and sat on the couch for another hour. then the fog of dizziness and nausea slowly faded away.  you would have thought that that would have swayed me from ever touching that stuff again but that wasn't the case. i ate a leftover steak and opened the can again and dipped more. the exact same thing happened again. i stopped once and for all that day. looking back now i realize what a fucking idiot i was. i'm lucky i didn't fucking die. to this day if someone opens a can around me my stomach does violent barrel rolls.

when my wife scheduled her surgery it was all good. she scheduled it and went through with it on novemember 5th. we were not covered at that time and insurance company probably won't pay for it. they had mailed us the notice of non payment, but those envelopes got buried in the chaos, and i'm not responsible with opening my mail.

the day before follow up surgery, we find out we don't have coverage, just over 3 months passed last payment so i don't think there is anyway to fix this. went from everything going great, to catastrophy

got the explanation of benefits and the total cost is a little over $20,000. i'm just thankful it's not more, but it easily could be.

i'm hoping they will reduce the costs if we pay in cash and give us a discount or payment plan options. wife is furious, it was my job to make sure health insurance is taken care of. man i fucked up

input: Text: i tend to write rather long posts, so  

so long time lurker here but this is my first post. 

mandatory 'did not happen today' but actually two years ago. posting though as my friends still enjoy laughing at it. 

i started learning guitar about 3 years ago. all self-taught by youtube and i became rather comfortable playing the instrument. 

i had progressed quite a bit when my friend and i decided to enter our school's interhouse music competition. we got a band together and entered a group piece. i would be playing guitar and singing. 

my music teacher at school had recently discovered that i could play guitar and sing so she asked me to also enter in a solo piece. i considered this and finally decided to enter as i thought 'hey, it's a good way for me to get out of my comfort zone right?' 

to give you an idea what i was like then, i was shy. i was able to talk in front of 5 people but the moment the group got larger than that, i got stage fright. now what was i thinking registering to play in front of the whole school. 

my band practiced everyday for weeks before the show and i could play and sing the songs in my sleep. unfortunately this left me very little time to practice my own piece. i would practice quickly before leaving for school or before bed, but never enough until i was confident with the piece. 

the night of the show arrives and my band is pumped. we've practiced this over and over again. we were determined to nail this performance. i on the other hand was not feeling that great about my solo piece. 

the show starts and i am to perform my solo piece third and then our band will perform after interval.

the second performance begins and i plug in back stage and get ready. i am practically struggling to stand up straight. second performance finishes and the mc goes up to announce me while i stumble on stage, trembling. i'm thankful for the spotlight which prevents me from seeing the crowd,  but i'm sure it illuminated my embarrassed face even more. the sound engineers give the thumbs up that i can begin. 

i start playing jeff buckley's hallelujah, remembering the lyrics and notes. first verse goes well and i get through the chorus. when i reach the second verse though i suddenly blank. i stop right there on stage in front of my school, trying to figure out what the note was, but my mind was mush. nothing. i do the next appropriate thing i can think of and apologise profusely to the audience. i then, in an obviously shaky voice ask the judges if i may restart. they nod and i start again. 

this time i start and play the song. i missed out the last verse but i keep telling myself that no one notice. i also found out later that i played the wrong chords and sounded completely off, but i was just thankful that it was over and found relief in the fact that i wouldn't have to face my peers until... i played for my band in half an hour. my mortified self realised that my embarrassment would have to be short lived. 

my band finds me during interval, trying to hide my face, and we get ready. instruments are tuned and, after warming up, my voice feels brilliant.

we go on stage and we kill it. we absolutely nailed the song and received a standing applause. 

i definitely fu my first performance but i stepped out of my comfort zone and as a result am much more confident now. this may sound strange, but i'm kind of glad i fu, at least now it can't get worse (i hope). 

tl;dr signed up for a school music competition. forget the words of my solo and made a fool of myself in front of my school but saved my reputation (well most of it) with my band's performance. thank you band! all in all i'm glad i did it as it built confidence.

sorry there hasn't been one yet, but nothing's happened. bit of an anti climax really:

i raised it with my girlfriend by asking to talk about ""those texts i sent you"" and she had no idea what i was talking about. i gave a bit more detail without giving too much away and it was clear they'd never gone through.  

my ipad is wifi only, and so only those people on ios received the messages, meaning the gf and mother are none the wiser. 

in any case, it wasn't something i was actively hiding, it just never came up. i abhor lying and will always tell the truth if asked, so i thought fuck it and told her what i'd sent (without the gruesome details), she was nonplussed, asked a couple of expected questions and semi-jokingly told me that she would cost more. then we ate a pizza. 

so while my mom didn't receive the messages, my sister definitely did, and would have told her about them, in how much detail i don't know. i still haven't spoken to either of them but there's still a chance of a minor shitstorm.

i'll update again if any lols come out of this.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: my son has been in college since last fall. last november, my 16 year old stepdaughter brought up allegations that my son had abused her repeatedly for several years. i confronted my son and he categorically denied it. but i knew that even though he was my son, i could not defend him for such an awful act.

my wife and i reported him to the authorities. my son was arrested in december and held in prison for a several weeks because i refused to provide him bail money. he was eventually expelled from his ivy league college.

in the middle of january, my stepdaughter broke down and admitted she lied about everything. she had actually been having sex with her boyfriend and was scared the news would reach us.

the charges were dismissed and my son was released immediately but the damage was done. his first girlfriend from college ended things with him. the news spread about the allegations and all his childhood friends have decided to just stay away from him even though i called each and every one of them personally.

i have called the school and explained the situation and even though they sympathized, they said he needed to reapply for the next school year and go through the admissions process again. 

my son is understandably furious at us. he has moved back home and refuses to talk to me at all. both my wife and i have apologized to him repeatedly. we have banned my stepdaughter from our home permanently and she has been sent to live with her father in another state. my wife and i also agreed to completely disinherit her from our wills. it has been a very painful situation. all of us started therapy.

the realization of how badly i ruined my son’s life hit me when i picked up his first prescription of anti-depressants today. i bawled my eyes out in my car.

he is the pride and joy of my life. he is outgoing, funny, intelligent and the kindest person i know. but when i handed him his medication, i could not even recognize him. he locks himself in his room, does not eat properly and has lost several pounds so far. 

whenever i try talking to him, i just see the hate he has for me in his eyes. i don’t know if i can ever get him to love me again.

i know he is on reddit very often. t, if you are reading, i want to tell you again how sorry your stepmom and i are. i promise i will get you into college again. i know i can’t get you back the year you lost. but i will do everything in my power to make this right. everything i have has always been for you. i hope you will give me a chance to fix this. i love you so much it hurts. i failed as a father and i hope one day you will forgive me.

this just happened like 20 minutes ago and i had to type this because i felt so dumb.

input: Text: so i moved away from home for the first time at the beginning of this semester, and i've been putting off doing my laundry basically this whole time. i don't have any washing machines in my building, so it's just a big inconvenience i'd like to avoid. anyways after going commando  for a couple of days (which i've discovered is actually wonderful) i finally conceded. 

i don't have any laundry detergent, so i go to the store to pick some up , how hard could it be. well apparently there are a lot of different kinds of laundry detergent, and seeing as i usually just use whatever's around the house i get a little bit lost. luckily, my friend zack is with me and he points one out, ""this one's good,"" he says. "" it smells great."" so i buy it , go home, throw my clothes in a garbage bag (a pretty big garbage bag, considering how long i've avoided laundry) and head out.
the washing machines seem pretty standard, so i pour my detergent in, start it, and then sit around and wait. an hour later it's done and dry, so i throw it back in the garbage bag and head home to fold them. 

as soon as i take them out of the bag the smell hits me, and it's not bad, it's just familiar. memories start pouring in to my mind as this smell rushes through my nostrils, and that's when i realize that i bought the same detergent my ex-girlfriend uses. my whole wardrobe now smells like her now.

input: Text: so this actually happened about a week ago when my girlfriend and i moved into our new place.

we had just finished consummating our new home and smoking a celebratory first house blunt when we decided to go smoke a cigarette. now, going outside is something we never had to do before to smoke a cig. we'd just open a window in the apartment we used to live in and smoke inside. this being the first night at the new place we hadn't properly learned all the locks and what not on the doors. mainly the doorknob locks. never had those before at the apartment, just bolt locks. so happily we go outside in our pjs, me in gym shorts and a crappy white tshirt i had on for most of the day, and her in capitals boxers with an expressions of darth vader tshirt on. both in flip flops. as soon as i shut the back door i knew i had fucked up as i could feel how the knob was locked literally a second too late. i turned to my girl with a look of terror and she knew immediately that i had just caused a first homeowners mistake and locked ourselves out of our house...in our pjs...at midnight...both cell phones upstairs in the bedroom...at about an [8]. we tried all the windows, which were locked, and contemplated breaking a window (as she put it, we have a year to fix it so whatever). of course we ended up deciding to just suck it up and go to a neighbors house, none of which we had met yet. she suggested i go by myself as she was embarrassed to which i responded there's no way in hell anyone in their right mind would open their front door for a guy that looks like me (big beard, big guy, in pjs) at midnight and that having her was essential to getting someone to let us use their phone. 

so we started knocking. we got through about three houses before finally someone opened their door for us. it was a nice asian man and what i presume was his just woken up by our knocking grandma or mother who didn't speak english. i should mention he didn't speak english very well either so it took about five minutes of explaining why we needed his phone and that yes, we really were his neighbors. luckily he had seen our moving truck and believed us.  the whole time they're just staring at my girlfriend probably due to the mix of funny clothing, sex hair, stoned eyes, and no bra while i frantically call my dad so he can bring the spare key out (for the life of me i don't know what made me make an extra earlier that day at home depot, but it saved our ass). after hanging up we thanked him, rosy cheeked and all, as we went to leave. he offered to let us hang out there until my father came but we were way too embarrassed to sit there any longer. my dad decided it was hilarious so he went and picked my mom up and bought some coffees (all the time we're outside in pjs like where the fuck is he?!) to bring over. he was giggling and doing a little dance as he walked up to the house, i guess he thought it was funny as hell (we did too honestly, i'm sure the weed helped). all in all it turned out to be a pretty funny experience, and not gonna lie, i did it again a day later but luckily we had our phones and my dad was close by so we didn't have to go through anything embarrassing again. needless to say we have a hidden key now, but we never lock the doorknob lock anymore anyways. now every time i call my dad he starts off by answering with ""please, not again."" honestly, i can't help but laugh and think of how awesome a story it is for our first night living together. oh, and the house is fucking awwwwesome!

fast forward several hours later to this morning, i'm in the bathroom getting ready for my day. my mind begins to wander when i notice a small, red blob on my shorts. i thought, ""oh! jam!"" i swiped it up with my finger and stuck in my mouth, licking it clean. hmm.... it doesn't taste very sweet. and the texture is a bit mucousy. wait.... i used grape jam. we don't even *have* any strawberry jam. then what did i...? oh. oh my god. ooooh shit. what the fuck did i just put in my mouth? fucking fuck! ack! i began to gag a bit. it was a clot of blood. menstrual blood. i ate my own goddamn fucking menstrual blood and it didn't even *taste good*!!!

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: alright so this happened about 6 months ago but it's probably the stupidest decision i've ever made in my life and quite the story to tell. so anyway my best friend and i were bored over the summer and would always go to ikea/various stores and entertain ourselves usually involving building toilet paper/ mattress forts or even playing kickball in a variety of stores. anyway we were at ikea late at night over the summer and entered a big storage area of the store with 5-6 story high shelves loaded with furniture and cardboard boxes. keep in mind the store closed at 9 and we were in there around 9:45-10....
trying our best not to make any noise or get caught, i thought'd it'd be sweet if we could climb up some of these storage shelves 50-60 ft above the ground and just chill out. so he told me to go first and i just made my way up, realizing it probably wasn't the safest idea we ever had, but hey we were teenagers looking for some fun. so i get about halfway up the structure (30-40 ft) swing my leg up to get higher. i wasn't really focusing on where my leg was going and smacked it on a metal bracket that held the shelf up. at first i didn't really think much of it because it didn't hurt at all and just thought it would bruise up the next day. however, as i pulled myself to my feet on the next shelf, i felt something drop down my leg and sure enough i've got a massive gash on my kneecap and i'm gushing blood all over assorted furniture and cardboard boxes. like these things are soaked and the blood continues to drip shelf by shelf onto more ikea products.
at this point my friend starts to begin to notice what's going on and starts to freak out. i'm working my way down so we can get to an urgent care or something when an ikea employee appears and begins to stock the shelves just below me. this is the point where i'm honestly worried for my life. meanwhile i just wait for this guy to stock his cardboard boxes while i'm sweating bullets 5 ft above him, all the while losing massive amounts of blood which continues to spill on ikea products. he eventually leaves and i make my way down. however, because the store had already closed, these metal barriers had separated the doors from this storage area for god knows what reason. anyway, my friend and i proceed to hop this barrier (still bleeding) and find our way to the men's room. we spent the next 45 minutes stopping the bleeding and making sure we wouldn't get caught on the way out if they hadn't already found the trail of blood we had left. at around 10:45 we stopped hearing the construction sounds/ banging of boxes and decided it was time. we ran out the door( me limping) and booked it down an escalator to my car, hearing people yelling behind us but not stopping for anything. he drove me home where we put cleaned up the wound and had to tell our parents the stupid decision i had made😂. we went to urgent care the next morning and got my knee stitched it up, explaining to my doctor how exactly it had happened. still wondering what they thought about the incident/ how they took care of the blood i left up there😂

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so this story happened a while ago, but when i told it to a friend of mine he urged me to post it here. so here goes..

i was at a party in a flat where only students live and at a certain time i was getting pretty intoxicated. i’m not quite sure how it started, but at some point i was making out with this girl, let’s call her emily, who lived on the same floor the party was at. we wanted some more privacy and thus she was dragging me to her room, which had been seen by some other girls. i think for the story it’s good to know that most people knew each other at this party. the girls who saw us were friends of emily and they all had another friend who i had hooked up with a while before this party. anyway, we entered the bedroom, locked the door and things were progressing to the point where we were no longer wearing clothes. the girls who spotted us thought emily couldn’t do this to their mutual friend and they were banging on the bedroom door. we were pretty drunk and the banging on the door, combined with screaming was kind of disturbing. in fact, emily thought she could convince her friends that i was not in her room, so that they would leave and we could continue. she quickly put some clothes on, but obviously i had to hide and the only place our drunk minds could think of was her closet. so while she was telling her friends to leave, i was hiding in the closet. i honestly believe they could still see my clothes on the floor though.

they soon left though and we were able to continue. about 10 minutes later, i think, they were back and we were getting annoyed. once again she opened the door to tell them to leave. this time i just hid under the blankets; she asked me to. they obviously knew emily wasn’t alone, but she thought she would just say it was someone else who was with her. the girls actually came in the room and i heard them talking right beside me. one person actually sat down on the bed, but that might have been emily as well, i never found out. i was just not giving a fuck (literally) and waiting for them to finally leave, which they eventually did.

 however, this is when shit got weird.. before we went to sleep, i had to pee. emily didn’t want me to go to the toilet, because then her friends would see me coming out of her bedroom. she suggested i used some sort of bucket she had in her room. so, i was peeing in a bucket in her bedroom, which was really strange to me. i remember thinking, why am i even doing this? i was honestly happy that i could sleep after that. in the middle of the night i woke up, when i noticed she was moving around. i was half asleep and not really sure if i was seeing things right, but it seemed as if she was peeing next to the bed. i’m not sure if she realised it, or maybe she thought the bucket was there or something. all i know is that she was still very drunk and i just fell back asleep. and then the morning sun rose and we were both waking up. i just wanted to go home asap and got out of bed to search for my clothes. and then i saw them lying next to the bed, on her side. i remembered waking up in the middle of the night, but i was hoping i had it all wrong. i did not. i picked up my clothes and they were wet. my jeans, shirt and vest had been freaking pissed on. the only thing i thought of was the fact that i had to cycle home for about 20 minutes, and i could not do that in my underwear only. so i just sucked it up, put on my pissed on clothes, cycled home and showered for about an hour while thinking: what the hell happened? emily and i never spoke of the pissed on clothes. i think she was too drunk to remember and i just found it way too awkward to tell her.

 

edit: okay so people seem to think the vest is weird. i'm also not sure if vest is the correct word, maybe its a cardigan. at least this is what it looks like: http://www.asos.com/asos/asos-cardigan-in-teal-green-cotton/prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=6359938&cid=7617&sh=0&pge=0&pgesize=36&sort=-1&clr=teal&totalstyles=462&gridsize=3

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: today i fucked up. after a long shift at work in a restaurant, i sat down on the porcelain throne for my ""evening constitutional."" (i promise that the details about defecation are necessary to set the mood, but that the post doesn't ""center"" around them.)

the men's room here has two urinals and one stall, the latter of which i'm occupying - and i tend to take my time when i go about my business. the stall is excessively large, with room for a diaper changing table and enough handicap access area to fit one and a half hoverounds. the partition blocks off the entire bathroom width (maybe five or six feet), with the door situated in a way that, upon entering the stall, one would have to make a ninety degree turn to navigate to the toilet.

i'd finished dropping the cosby kids off at the community pool and begun my paperwork when i heard a new party enter the bathroom: a trio of voices - two high pitched, one normal masculine - that i can only assume is a father and his two kids. as per usual, they beeline straight for the single stall, and quickly find that the door is locked.

this is not the first time that i've been in this situation in this restroom - last time, an intoxicated fellow decided to have a full conversation with me through the stall walls as he waited not-so-patiently outside. despite the inherent humor in the bawdy conversational material that the man had chosen to regale me with, i was distinctly unhappy at having my poo party-of-one crashed.

i hoped to avoid the same fate this time by ignoring all other would-be stall users. so as this man and his two kids began knocking on the door, i carefully folded the two-ply into a nice stack and lifted my rear off the seat for a big, hopefully final, wipe.

it was this most compromising moment when i caught a flash of motion in the edge of my vision. i look up to see a young girl, maybe five years old, on her hands and knees, half-entered into my private lounge. her eyes get big with surprise.

i make emergency maneuvers, but it is too late. the angle is just right that she had a clear view of my dingling-dangling wonder worm. 

""daddy, it's a boy!"" she gasps, as she retreat crawls back. 

""fucking christ!"" i exclaim, just as astonished (it's a *girl*!) as she at this pickle of a situation.

the father makes an unhappy grunt and yanks his offspring to her feet. i hurry the rest of my visit and shuffle out where we all avoid eye contact.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened when i was 7 years old.  


i lived in suburban midwest us, where all the kids in the neighborhood could walk alone to the park and each other's houses well across town.  my best friend lived on the other side of the park and for some reason i had this idea that it would be fun to write her an anonymous letter giving hints about which friend i was, and then inviting her to meet me at the park later to see if she had guessed correctly
.

i decided that the letter had to be typed so the handwriting wouldn't give me away.  this was 1997 and computers were so new that microsoft word was entertaining.  i had played pretend secratary enough that i had taught myself to print addresses on an envelope.  i typed up this long letter and gave her 3 clues describing who i was and set a future date for her to meet me.
    
a week or so goes by and i've pretty much forgotten about the letter when we get a frantic phone call from my friend's mom asking if i had received any suspicious mail.  she was so upset when she saw the letter that she went immediately to the police.  due to the typed envelope and the advanced grammar (thanks mom) the police believed there was no way this letter was from a 7 year old but surely a local child molester.  then undercover agents were sent to stake out the park and wait for his arrival.
her mom was calling all the parents in town warning them to check the mail and be on the lookout for local predators.

i got grounded *for lying about my involvement  at first* for quite awhile and was scared straight after i had to tell my story to the policeman.  whoops.

*edit:  yes, everyone, i know computers existed well before 1997

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: help me. i fucked up so bad. i don't know where i am. i don't know what is real and what is not. i think my computer and my phone is the only way i can communicate with the real world. fuck.

these were exactly my thoughts at the apex of my fuck up. 

i've never been a person to really use drugs or alcohol, but i decided to go on a hike with some friends where 7 (out of 8) of us decided to trip on shrooms. i've had my fair share with alcohol and weed, but i've always started out slow and built up a pretty good tolerance and gauge of my limits. this time however, i decided to start with 3 grams which supposedly is the regular dose (we found out later that the scale was broken and it was closer to 4 grams). for 5 of us, it was our first time. i took the lowest dose, with one of my friends taking 6 grams. 

we finally got to the beginning of the trail and we all ate our shrooms. the trail was about 1.3 miles long and we began walking. roughly 20 minutes in and my friends were beginning to trip, there was a nice waterfall or something at the end of the trail so we really wanted to make it; however, after half an hour or so we found a flat area where we decided we had to sit down.

until we sat down, i had felt little to nothing. then it hit me like a brick wall. almost immediately after sitting down, the ground beneath me starting moving. i've always been skeptical of hallucinogenics so i thought i was maybe just dehydrated from the heat. i drank water, and the trees started to move. i realized this shit was real, i was tripping. i saw light streaks, the trees moved like the optical illusion with leaves. i was feeling a lot of things at this time, just laughing a lot, it felt a little hard to breathe, but i was having a good time. the sky would turn from blue to green to purple and back to blue. i was just seeing crazy shit. this phase lasted from around 3pm to 5 pm. i was tripping balls but i still remember roughly what happened. after 5 pm...not so much.

the last thing i do remember between 5pm - 8pm is when my friends ask if we're ready to go. i think there's a general consensus of yes. 

i wake up in a car, with half of my friends. i think i've passed out for a long time. i check my phone...""8:30 pm"". i think to myself, there's no way i was out for only 3 hours. if i was, how the fuck am i in a car? the only possible solution? i was in a dream.

i vaguely remember my friends being hostile to me, but for no reason. constantly telling me to ""stop"" and then asking me if i was okay. it was scary, i didn't know what i did wrong. i remember trying to talk to get the attention of the sober member of my group, but not really sure why. i then remember being choke slammed into dirt by one of my friends. this really hurt in my mind. a lot. (apparently my friends told me later that i was trying to touch her hair and getting her to turn around and that resulted in me being slammed into the ground by my friend who took 6 grams.) at this point, the slamming, the hostility, it all felt unreal. it added to the idea that i was stuck in a dream world. i hadn't really woken up. i feel cuts on over my body and i feel a little sore, but i thought my mind was just compensating for when i got slammed in my dream.

i felt like it was really hard to move my body. i felt a cold breeze and it took almost 15 minutes to realize i wasn't wearing a shirt and i finally put it on. i looked at my friend, he was smoking from a bong. i saw the smoke come out and a couple seconds later i could smell the weed. it was a very weird disconnect between my senses. nothing felt right. they were still asking if i was okay from time to time but i couldn't really respond. they would occasionally say ""wooo! we made it."" i thought my mind was fabricating all of this. i was definitely not feeling okay, and these ""projections"" of my friends were trying to make me feel better.

i'm stuck in a car for over an hour, studying these projections, trying to figure out how i can tell they aren't real. i check my phone...no notifications, no messages, no phone call from my mom even though i've been passed out for what feels like probably a day (in reality i didn't remember what happened for 3 hours but i was awake). facebook seems like it didn't update since i checked it at lunch, it was just the same news feed. my mind was projecting this. i was in the car, afraid. i didn't know how to get out, where the car was, why i was with these 3 friends, why they were smoking. i was constantly touching the car around me. i was thinking that i should roll out of the car.

i felt powerless in the car and i decided maybe if i go to sleep i'll wake up for real. i remember thinking, holy shit the mind is so powerful, being able to fabricate all of this. i can live my world so differently, it's really what i believe is true is true. i don't really remember what happens in the car, probably because i decided to take a nap.

i finally get out of the fucking car. i feel a little better now. i remember my friend asking for my address, and as i get outside of the car, i see the in-n-out that's across my house. i'm thinking, of course. this is the easiest way my mind would recognize i'm home, of course i would fabricate it. 

i start running to my house and i try to open the door without keys. it's my mind fabricating this world right? i can unlock the door with my mind. nope. i can't open the door. i'm confused as fuck at this point. i check my pockets, my keys are gone. i didn't fabricate keys in my pocket? what the fuck am i doing? goddamn it. i start peering into my house, seeing if i can see my mom. i'm thinking maybe i should run through the window. i start to get scared again. i look at the streets with the cars flying by. i start to think about the easiest way to get out of this dream world. run onto the streets and get hit by a car? drive my own car and just speed into something? fortunately, i was too scared to do either. instead i constantly ask my friends for hugs. when i hug them, i feel body warmth. at this point i'm hoping i'm in the real world, but it doesn't feel like it. i'm desperately looking for things to help convince myself that i am in the real world. i start touching my friend's hair to see if it's real. 

the door opens. my mom is there. i was thinking holy shit, my mind finally opened the door. i'm not really convinced my mom is real. i say bye to my friends who dropped me off and walk straight to my room and get on the computer. for some reason, i felt that the internet would be the only way for me communicate with the real world. i looked up bad trips on shrooms but i couldn't find anything too similar to what i was feeling. i thought about posting on reddit that i was stuck, that i needed help and asap. i thought about calling the cops that i was stuck. i was in my room but i didn't feel at home at all.

i was still thinking of ways of how i had to die so i could wake up in the real world. am i in a coma right now? on a bed in the hospital? should i starve myself to death? what's the easiest way? or should i go with a fast way like getting hit by a car? this was some inception shit. oh fuck i'm like molly. what the fuck is real.

as i'm thinking of these ways to fix everything. i'm interrupted by a phone call from my best friend. i think to myself, holy shit. finally. someone in the real world that realizes i'm gone. i choose not to pick up, because i need to figure this out by myself. i don't want to freak out anyone in the real world. if i got a phone call from my best friend telling me that he's stuck in some dream world, i would think it's a joke. i didn't want to burden anyone else in this. i fucked up, it's my responsibility to fix all of this. two missed calls from my best friend. i start to think to myself, maybe i should let my phone die, so i don't have the temptation to communicate with the real world. what if i'm in a coma for months but my phone somehow is still working, that would freak everyone out. holy shit, this is how ghost stories work. fuckkkk. maybe it's like interstellar where i have to try and communicate with the real world.

my thoughts are interrupted by knocking at the door. my mom asks me who that is, and i respond with shrug. my best friend is suddenly at the door. i think to myself holy fuck my projections are on point. he's wearing the same clothes as i last saw him, meaning my brain is just using the last available information to reconstruct him. i wasn't sure if he was real or not, but i start freaking out in front of him and my mom. i tell him that i don't know what's real and that i'm really scared. like really scared. (he later tells me that i straight up asked if we did shrooms in front of my mom, lol). they both tell me to take a shower, listen to some happy music and go to sleep. i'm thinking to myself, of course i make my projections agree with each other. i tell them okay, go into the bathroom and completely break down.

i stare into the mirror and start crying. i repeat variations of ""i fucked up"" for a minute or so. i come back out and they're standing right there, and i pretend as if nothing happened. i grab my pj's and go take a shower. i see cuts and bruises on my ribs and think maybe that me getting slammed to the ground was actually real. as i'm taking a shower, i'm still thinking of the best ways to kill myself and get out of this dream world because this is too scary. i realize that i don't have my glasses and i've been wearing my contacts this entire time. just like my keys, my glasses are missing. at the time i thought, shit, my mind is getting tired, it can't fabricate everything. i can't keep this up. i have to do something.

i get out of the shower and decide i should probably look more into shrooms and their effects (something i should've done before i agreed to even take any). my phone starts ringing again, my best friend. what? he was just here...my mom is by me, probably because she notices that something isn't right. i still think my mom is a projection at this point, so i figured i might as well ask her if i should pick up my friend's phone call. she says yes, so after two missed calls, i pick up the phone. 

i couldn't hold my shit together. i don't remember exactly what went on during the phone call but i kept apologizing to my friend. i told him i'm so sorry that i fucked up so bad. i didn't know what was real and what wasn't. he tries to assure me that everything will be fine, and that we'll play volleyball tomorrow. i then told him that i was having a terrible trip, which he tells me that saying that in itself shows what kind of grasp i have on reality. this is probably the turning point in the night where i'm like oh shit. that makes sense. we laugh a little about that.

my mom tells me that there's food, i'm reluctant to eat because starving feels like a good way to die. i decide to test my mom, i ask her for a cup of water. i walk into my room and walk back into the dining area to see if a cup of water appears. okay, maybe she is real after all. i end up eating because i was hungry and wasn't too sleepy. 

i start to think back. i was in the car with those friends, and say not with my best friend was because we all live fairly close to each other, whereas my best friend lives a little further. i didn't have my keys and glasses because they were in my bag that i left in my friends car. everything begins to make more sense. 

i begin texting all my friends who were on that trip, to see if they would respond with something genuine. even my best friend, i texted him to see if i would get responses that my mind couldn't possibly fabricate. the texts between my friends and i gave me more and more assurance that i was actually in the real world all this time. i was still confused about some things as to how i got into the car, why i was choke slammed, all cut up etc, but i figured i would ask my friends tomorrow when i see them and i had a much better grasp now that i felt okay not knowing exactly what happened. my sober friend took videos and pictures of our trip (no pun intended) and i figured that it would answer all my questions. 

i go to sleep and that's pretty much the end of it because i wake up the next day completely fine, just still a little confused.

i still haven't asked my friends about all the details, because it's a little embarrassing and my sober friend hadn't brought up the fact that i tried to touch her hair (i had just heard from my other friends). i haven't seen the videos and i still need to apologize to her. i'm so grateful and surprised that my friends didn't freak out too when i was having a really bad trip. i love my friends, even the one that choke slammed me (i was really wishing this was actually a dream). i think that the hallucinations were made worse because i was probably dehydrated (i don't recall drinking water after 5 pm until i got home, and i lost my water bottle).

at the end of the day, i just wanted to say that definitely be careful of what you're putting into your body. i'm not going to tell you how to live your life but my advice with substances is not to go too hard the first time. i'm so grateful that nothing bad actually happened that day because i realize now that we could all have fallen off a cliff and died. this experience has made me feel so much more grateful for the people around me and the things that i have. i've never been more scared in my life, not knowing what is real and what isn't. it really isn't something you can entirely explain, and something you have to experience for yourself (hopefully you won't have to).

input: Text: so this happened about 20 min ago. i had gotten done with my quiet night of gaming and decided to take a shower before bed. as i was brining my dinner plate downstairs i noted my roommate was out and about. 

a little info: if i know my roommate is home, i will take my clothes into the shower with me and come out with at least pants on, out of courtesy for another person. if he is not home, i may or may not have boxers on, depending on how i feel. 

anyway, after drying off i open the door, and there are two girls standing outside his room, which happens to be directly adjacent to the bathroom. i was definitely not wearing pants, or boxers. aside from the brief awkwardness, i shrugged it off and walked to my room, down the hall a bit. 

i don't tend to get uncomfortable, as being in the military really prevents you from being shy. can't speak for them though, they seemed shocked for sure. 

 

edit: they're still here, so i'm hoping i didn't scare them off and my roommate can get some.

edit:i learned i should learn to be a human and put on a towel when walking out of the bathroom. but for my credit, i didn't expect anyone there!

edit: as absolutely crazy as this is gonna sound, i was not looking to hook up with either of them, because i had to get up early this morning for studying/homework, and just wanted to sleep. 

update: got a text this morning from roommate. apparently they found it hilarious, and a huge turn on. not sure what happened, as i passed out shortly after this post, but i'm assuming the best for him.
