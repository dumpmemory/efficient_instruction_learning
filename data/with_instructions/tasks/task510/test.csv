input: Text: in good fashion this happened months ago. when i'm drunk i like to cook with in the safety of my home with a sober supervisor. 

when i grab round shaped objects like apples or oranges i throw them backward over my shoulder and catch them. being drunk i thought i could do this with an egg. turns out i'm an egg. 

in my drunken haze i threw the egg over my shoulder and all was going well. my friend thought i was doing just fine except i misjudged the distance of the fridge door in front and the egg landed perfectly in my hand but i extended too far and hit the fridge door, i closed my fist tight and crushed the egg. handful of egg shell and yolk plus whites dropped down all over the floor. 

i learned my lesson.

normally, i set my alarm one hour before i need to be awake and snooze my way through: this is how i boot my brain up. by the time i snooze ten times, i'm pretty self-aware.


except i decided to sleep until i was on in half-an-hour, 15 minutes to get ready and 15 to get there.


and within ten minutes of starting, i make a terrible, terrible mistake.
running the pos, i mistake bal (balance due) as chg (change due).
so, a customer pays $20 out of a $26.12 purchase. i put in $20 from the customer. i thought it was odd that the register wouldn't print a receipt, but the customer didn't want it. so i overrode the register and handed them $6.12.


fast-forward ten minutes, i realize that my till will be short $12.24. because the next customer that pays cash makes me think about bal and chg. i didn't want to be short anything, so my first purchase with payday money is covering  my mistake right back to my employer.

input: Text: so i saw the other one night stand post, and i think mine was probably worse, you be the judge.

to set the scene it was a monday night, should have been tip off 1 not to go out but it was first week back to college after winter break and my room mates were going to one of the better pubs in town so i thought what the hell why not. like most college students i'm a broke as mother fucker, and decide to split a 26 of jack daniels with my one roommate. now fairly intoxicated me appears at the bar. my plan to not spend money there fails, and i drop 200$ on drinks, just for myself (fuck up two). walking to the washroom where all romantic meetings occur i lock eyes with a brunette who seemed cute at the time. after i finish up go out to pursue new found intrest, i find her waiting outside the washroom for me, kinda weird totally into her taking it upon herself to chase me though, and think nothing of it.we end up back at my place and begin to do the deed, but something isn't right my dick hurts a bit, i figure she's just pretty tight and we ran out of lube. flash forward to the morning i am amazingly hungover, have no money turn over (totally oblivious to someone else in my bed) and think that's pretty cool, turn to get out of bed and instantly fall on the floor on my stomach. remember the dick pain? i sure as hell didn't, so i run (waddle swiftly) to look and see my dick is stuck inside out. inside the fuck out. i go and be the lovely gentleman i am and lead the lady out of my house so i can deal with this, to find what looked like a bloody murder scene on my sheets, she smiles and goes, ""do you know if anyone in your place has tampons?"" welp, now i have to burn the sheets. i have no idea what to do about my inside out dick, so i go to a clinic the next day at this point my dick feels like it's being chocked by an elastic band while with every step i take someone is giving me a sand paper hand job. they told me ""well just take the treatment after we test you, if it's something you're covered if it's nothing no side effects."" i think well how bad could the treatment be, it's not like it'll be a needle in the ass...it was...it was a needle in the ass, new form of gonorrhea, and chlamydia treatment in canada (well at least ontario). great now that it's over they send me to a urologist, and could you believe it if i said i needed surgery cause i did. so, i sit here 1 week removed from penis surgery with 26 stitches, holding my cock together, a literal pain in my ass, not able to do anything sexual for the next 3 months.

i was probably like 11 or 12 when this happened, and i had been watching olympic handball with my brother. we decided to play a 1v1 version in our own house (already a bad idea.) 

so we're playing when i decide to make fun of how the goalkeepers kick every ball that they could probably easily stop with their hands. 

my brother launches the ball, and i, being the idiot that i am, dropkick the air, totally missing the ball. i landed on the ground, and the momentum carried my leg directly to my balls. 

we stopped playing handball after that.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: my grandma had polio as a child and cannot use her right leg. she drove with her left leg for years, but after some recent problems, she decided to sell her car since she can no longer drive.

she took a fraction of the sale of her car to buy me a car (yay! i love it.) i have to drive her around, no big deal.

i woke up on a pleasant thursday morning at 6am to take her to the dentist. i showered, got dressed, did my normal morning activities, and then went out to prep the car for her wheelchair.

normally, i would have just gotten in my car, started it, and put it in reverse to allow enough space for her wheelchair.

this summer i have been put on three different anti-depression medications to combat my crippling depression. the one i'm on now makes me sleep for 10+ hours a day, and makes me feel groggy for hours.

having to wake up at 6am, getting only 5 hours of sleep felt awful...

my *brilliant* mind decided, ""i drive a manual! i can just pop it into neutral, and push the car backwards enough and not have to use any gas!"" 

so i put my car into neutral, walk to the front of my car and give in a slight push.

it starts rolling backwards! success!

it rolls back far enough so i pull on the bra of my car.

it doesn't stop. 

it keeps rolling backwards. my car approaches the slant of my driveway. 

i run around the car and start pushing on the bumper trying to keep my 3000 pound car from rolling down the driveway.

it keeps rolling *towards* me now.

i jump out of the way.

luckily, i live in a cul-de-sac that hardly anyone drives in.

i let my car roll back into it, i sprint faster than i've ever sprinted in my life to the driver side door. i get in, push the brake, and my car stops. 

i look over and realize that my car has ran over the trash we had put out, and now i have to clean up a bunch of trash...

and use more gas than i would have used backing the car out.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened back in 2000 or 2001 a little bit before dale earnhardt passed away.   i'm not into racing but one of my best friends was a true nascar fan and visiting from the midwest.   my cousin was the gas man for a driver, #43, and so he hooked us up with some pit passes so we could see the action up close.  

we drove down to fontana (near la) for the race, got the pit passes, and parked the rental car.   we were more than an hour early and so strolled to the track.   there were luxury boxes and one of them had a #43 sign so we went in to kill some time.   we were both in our 20s at the time and had never had more than a few dimes to scratch together so what we encountered blew us away -- full buffet, beer, top-shelf liquor, and a hostess in a black and white uniform, neck ruffle and bow tie.   she welcomed us, took our orders and so i was feeling pretty good about myself, scoring points with my best friend for the vip treatment.  i'm already writing the thank-you note to my cousin in my head.

after about an hour of stuffing ourselves, and getting waited on hand and foot by the hostess, a few more people started showing up and i figured they were cousins or friends of my cousin the gas man.  i did notice that they were significantly better dressed than we were, but what the heck - it was nascar.   they weren't very friendly, though, and congregated by themselves in a corner.  

to set the scene a little better, we have a group of 50-somethings with ties, sport coats, sipping whisky neat and two 20 year olds wearing jean shorts, t-shirts and ""intimidator"" baseball caps double-fisting beers.  

i'm usually pretty quick in social situations but having never been to a nascar event, or a luxury box, so i was a little slow and still hadn't figured it out .   i ordered another beer and got a stern 'not impressed' look from the hostess  - the only thing a #43 car and a #43 luxury box have in common are 4 and 3.   uncomfortable.  we made like we had somewhere more important to be and took off.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: following an inner ear infection around six weeks ago, my hearing had been sensitive for weeks already, but i figured it would settle down. there was no active infection, ear ache or vertigo so i saw no problem in going on a business trip to portugal last week. my sensitive hearing made the meetings hard work and the days exhausting, but i laid off the alcohol, ate well and made sure i got enough rest.

friday i woke up in a new kind of hell. the hotel aircon sounded like a truck running stationary next to my head and i couldn't tell which sounds were meant to be background noise and which ones weren't. everything was loud. too loud. it drove me to tears. earplugs weren't enough.

i was taken to a hospital where the language barrier didn't help, the doctors there just saw a tearful upset version of me and administered repeat doses of valium (first liquid, orally, then an injection) till i stopped crying, and then sent me off with a prescription for further valium in tablet form. thankfully i wasn't alone; my colleague stayed with me and made sure i woke up the next morning, had breakfast, woke me up when after breakfast i fell asleep again, and made sure i made it onto my (rescheduled) flight back (during which i slept) and into a cab home (i slept during the ride, the driver woke me).

i got home around midnight, had a light snack and my evening dose of valium, went to bed... and didn't wake up until around 18 hours later. went to bed at my 'normal' bedtime (just hours later), not sure whether i took my meds or not, woke up normally the next morning, deliberately didn't take my morning dose because i wanted to see a doctor at my regular gp practice first, informed work, stayed home, made the appointment, saw a locum doctor instead of my own gp, and was told to take the meds as prescribed in portugal. so i did when i got home (lunchtime) and guess what: i fell asleep again. this time only for a few hours, till in the evening, so i did a few things, had dinner, took my night time dose and went to bed.

next morning - yesterday morning - i woke up around 6am (my usual time), had breakfast, took my morning meds and got ready for the day... or so i thought. i fell asleep, half dressed, on top of the bed, and didn't wake up until around 12 hours later to a bunch of missed calls, texts and whatsapps from work. i would never think of going awol but that's exactly what i've done, however unintentionally.

having had a lot of explaining to do, and in the realisation that the only reason they want to see me back in the office may be that i'll be carrying the company laptop & information on me so they can take them from me and sack me right after, i decided not to take any more pills, stayed home today to withdraw/recover, phone the doctor's office to tell them i'd be ignoring their advice, and to prepare myself for my return to the office tomorrow (read: i expect to get the sack.)

if it all gets too upsetting tomorrow i can always go back to taking valium again, eh? it's done nothing for my actual symptoms relating to my sensitive hearing, but it stopped me from being able to cry over it so it may have that effect after i get the boot, i suppose.

i met my girlfriend while i was in the hospital. she is the prettiest and most caring nurse in the physical rehabilitation ward and, to my knowledge, the world. she also had a dark and hidden ""freaky"" side. 
this freaky side manifested itself when we began our sexual relationship. it 's awesome.
it culminated yesterday when we were getting into the nasty. out of nowhere she roars at me in a demonic satanic influenced voice, ""use your fucking stump!!!!""
""my stump?!?!"" i asked incredulously.
she replied in the sweetest angelic voice, ""yes"".

i lubed the shit out of my stump and started pushing in. she was irritated by my slow pace and pushed me onto my back. she got on top and as she was pushing down on my empire state building of a stump she let out a blood curdling scream. she immediately said we need to go to the hospital. thankfully, i live right next to the hospital. my school is right next to it. i teach english in korea.
i am now sitting in the emergency room of the hospital. she just went inside to get stitches for 3rd degree tears like she gave birth but in rewind.

input: Text: one of my first shifts at mcdonalds i was tasked with making a batch of quarter pounders. i went and got a tray of buns, when i opened them i saw buns sliced into 3. i'm like wtf, clearly a factory error, throw all the middle pieces in the bin, now it looks like a normal burger. i think i got maybe 15-20 burgers in before i realized i'd grabbed a sleeve of big mac buns and was throwing all the middle pieces out... in my defence i wasn't a big fast food eater, and i had never eaten a big mac before.

this happened before reddit came to exist but i saw a picture post today of a burger technician failing at making a big mac, this reminded me.

edit: folks are throwing shade on the golden arches, any job is better than no job and working at mickey ds was fun, i still don't think working there is beneath anyone, i do feel the need to clarify i was in high school. also used the phrase ""burger technician"" for comedic effect, real title is just ""casual junior"". thanks all :)

input: Text: i was recently visiting the us for a conference and was waiting at the gate in the airport, thinking how well the week had gone and i how i hadn't fucked anything up, when the urge to make a significant deposit in the bowl hit me. i thought i'd better see to it before i boarded the 8 hour flight back, so i headed to the toilet.

my diet over the course of my visit hadn't been the best, lots of bbq, burgers, pizza and convenience food and, once i seated myself in a stall, i released a large quantity of matter with varying consistencies... this was going to require no small amount of wiping and this is where i fucked up.

now the walls in these toilet stalls are like those in many american public toilets and, rather than going all the way to the floor, they stopped about a foot or so from the floor and left a gap to the next stall. as i was wiping away, some stray toilet paper, with a good coating of my shit on it, fell loose and began to tumble to the floor. this might not have been a problem, except that it fell down and through the gap to the next stall, landing on the man in that stall's polished leather shoe. he was standing feet pointing to the wall, urinating, and i am certain that he noticed what had happened. as i looked down, after a short moment he shook his foot and the sticky bit of toilet paper eventually came loose. while this happened i kept my head down, kept very quiet and tried to hide my shoes from view lest he later be able to identify me by my footwear. i waited for him to leave before quickly finishing up and making an exit myself, then spent a large portion of the flight home worrying that my shoes might get spotted by the guy and i'd be found out.

input: Text: so this happened quite a while ago but i've just been reminded of it by reading all the tifu's on reddit.

my parents and i had a blazing row about my lapse attitude towards schoolwork one night, and all finished the day absolutely furious with each other. the next morning i woke up to find they'd gone out together somewhere, and feeling sheepish about how i'd behaved the previous evening, i decided to do the housework for when they got back - you know, an act of kindness to show i was sorry. first job - hoovering, and i got one of those miele hoovers with the extendible pole ... only the pole wouldn't extend. you gotta press a button and pull to extend it, but no matter how hard i tried, it wouldn't extend. this is when things went south. i grabbed the end of the pole and started swinging it side to side, like a lightsaber - with the motion slowly edging the pole out. one last swing would do it, so i gripped it with both hands, and swung as hard as i could - the result being that the pole fully extended (longer than i had expected) and smashed a 12ft by 4ft mirror that had hung on the wall since before i could remember. the icing on the cake was that my parents had just turned up in the car, and were looking right through the living room window when, out of context, it looked as though i had simply baseball batted their mirror out of sheer anger.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: actually happened 2 days ago, but ya know.

so, i am on my highschool drumline, and i also do a seperate drumline every summer. its pretty fun and i was really looking forward to summer drumline camp this week! i ended up playing bass drum, which at camp is treated as one unit that is not allowed to seperate. the people who play bass drum have to eat lunch together, go to the bathroom together, coordinate outfits based on spirit days, and stuff like that. we also, when we play like crap, have to run laps around the church that the camp is in, together, holding hands like the family that we are. 

the fateful day was the beach day spririt day. since we weren't going to be marching, i wore flip flops, but also brought high-top converse just in case. we hadn't played part of a cadence right, so the bass drum coach had us run 3 laps around the church. i didn't want to run in flip flops because fuck that, and i didn't have time to put on my converse because they take forever to put on and lace up and the coach would definetly not be happy if i took the time to put them on, so i grabbed the hand of the guy next to me and set out for the laps. 

we had been inside all day in the nice air conditioned practice room, and i had no idea how hot it was outside. it may not be hot to some of you, but i think it was in the 80-90 degrees fahrenheit range. the way the lap went was: rough gravel, rough sidewalk, hot hot black pavement, grass, rough sidewalk, repeat. 

by the second lap i knew i had made a mistake and that my feet really hurt, but also if i asked to stop my fellow bass drummers and the coach would all be mad and we would probably end up getting more laps. when we reached the rough gravel on the last lap i yelped in pain, but i kept going because i assumed it was just some scrapes. 

we got back inside the practice room and i looked at my feet. they weren't scraped, the skin has been burned and rubbed and i had 2 big blisters on the front of my feet. the other bass drummers sat me down on a couch and got ice for my feet(the coach was nowhere to be found). it was extremely painful and although i really tried not to, i started crying and could not stop. 

the coach eventually came back to the room and told me to ""put some ointment on it tonight"". we got back to playing and eventually applied some burn cream and gauze from the first aid kit. my mom ended up picking me up and driving me to a doctor and they properly wrapped my feet and told me i had 2nd degree burns and they were the worst she had seen from pavement. it was very unlikely i would be able to march in our saturday parade. 

the next day i did end up going to camp late and attempting to play. the way my feet are wrapped it sorta looks like i don't have any toes, and so one of the drumline coaches asked me if i had ""burnt my nubs off"". i now have the nickname burnt nubs. 

after that day i decided not to go to camp or do any of our performances because i won't be healed enough for the weekend and i have highschool band camp during another performace. i feel pretty bad and dissapointed in myself for leaving my bass drum family, but i also can't walk(unless you call hobbling on my heels walking) for at least another few days, maybe more. i'm supposed to keep my feet wrapped in the little footies for a week. 

anyways, please wear shoes on pavement, this really sucks. also if pavement is too hot, don't walk your dogs on it! i would not wish my burnt nubs on anyone, especially a dog.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i really really fucked up. here's some background info, and i'll try to be concise a-la bullet-point style. please read it.

* i have been in a relationship with this guy for about 1.5 years. 
* 1 year of that has been long distance for various reasons (basically military/college).
* we're both 19.
* most of our relationship has been alright, a few ups and downs, but nothing we couldn't handle. 
* but the last few months he has not been so kind to me.. he insults me more, and doesn't have time to call. he takes me for granted and he knows that he's been neglecting me, but nothing has changed. i've unsuccessfully attempted to break up with him a couple times, but i always backed down and came to my senses.
* a couple months ago i was raped at my university. 
* he doesn't know. and i was afraid to tell him because i felt he would think i was trying to flirt around, or that it wasn't really rape, but that's a different story. the point is it happened and i didn't tell him.   

now that you're up to speed, my tifu: 
     
he had leave for a couple weeks in may, so i got to see him after 2 months. i was excited and nervous, because i knew we've been on the rocks and i saw this as an opportunity to reconnect and stoke some of those dying embers and breathe the love back in to our relationship.
    
unfortunately, things did not go as well as i hoped.. i'm a very independent person, but i have been so stressed lately and so traumatized and so alone that every little insult or dismissive remark from him put me in tears. then other days we would be fine and it would be like old times. repeat for the next month of his stay.
     
we have a large circle of friends that we're very close with, and over the last couple weeks a few of his friends have personally told me that my boyfriend, their friend, treats me terribly, and that it's not okay. i sheepishly just nodded it off and things continued as is between me and him. 

he left again two weeks ago, but this time i won't hear from him again til july. usually he at least has cell-phone service, but with the training he is doing, he won't have any reception.

we parted on a good note, and i was starting to be hopeful for our future again. but one of our friends started to hang out with me more and it turns out we had a lot in common. i was able to not only open up to him about the rape, but... he didn't judge me for it, and he was kind, and he's always been very respectful towards me. 

these last two weeks he and i have been hanging out a lot, just as friends, and it's been refreshing to not be put down, and if i start crying about anything he just holds my hand and wipes my tears and doesn't call me a crybaby or stupid. he told me i deserve much better than what i have with my boyfriend, but other than that he's kept his opinions to himself.

well, today he told me that he likes me a lot. and i fucked up and i told him that i liked him too, and then we kissed. and now i'm home typing this up, and i have no idea what to do, or how to feel, and i just don't want to be alone. i've fucked up and complicated things. i kissed one of his friends for fucks sakes! this is ridiculous, and i feel so lost on this.

i won't get to talk to my boyfriend again til july, and he doesn't come home until thanksgiving in november. i'm so scared reddit. i'm so stupid. 

thanks for reading.

so this is my story. i live in a third world country (bangladesh) where gaming consoles and accessories are extremely overpriced. our family goes on yearly trips to australia to visit family and friends. being the avid gamer i am, i decided to buy the all new ps4. i had saved up my birthday money from the last 2 years and with a little bit of help from my mom, i would be able to afford the console. so when i arrive in australia, the first thing i do is i get the much awaited console in a bundle with killzone shadow fall, fifa 14 and need for speed rivals. i play on the console a couple of times before packing it up in the box itself. since the trip is so long, we have to stop by singapore for a couple of days. i travelled with the ps4 box like a briefcase and used it as hand luggage. so the day my family and i leave for bangladesh, we leave our luggage at the airport before, so we don't have to deal with the hassle with bringing them along. i only have my backpack and ps4 box in my hand as i move into immigration. i decided to put the box in one of those trolley things. as we entered the waiting room for the flight, i had returned the trolley with my ps4 in it. unbeknownst to me, i hoarded the plane all excited to play my console back at home. it was then i realised that i had lost my ps4. thats $550 aud i'll never get back and a broken heart.

i had just gotten one of the guitar hero games for my ps2, and was jamming out for hours. until the batteries died. :(

*no big deal, i've got these new duracel recharcheables! let's get these things opened up!*

good thing i had a pair scissors handy, right? except i didn't. pocket knife? nope. regular knife? 'fraid not. being the genius that i am, i decided to use my freshly-changed utility blade with which to do the honors. 

standing there, with the pack of batteries in one hand and my utility blade in the other, i had to somehow figure out a way to stabilize the pack of batteries...

*i know! i'll use my trusty finger!*

fuck!

input: Text: tifu by not unplugging the garbage disposal.so this actually happened about 5 months ago now. during my move-in inspection i noted that the garbage disposal on the kitchen sink wasn't working. i could hear the motor click on but it wasn't spinning/grinding, which wasn't a big issue to me. now i have two housemates. when one of them moved in i let them know not to use the garbage disposal because it's not working. now for my first minor fuck up. when the second one moved in i forgot to tell them that until they had already tried to use it. now they didn't put anything too bad in there and it still drained so it wasn't too big of a deal...until this particular day. my first housemate and i had avoided using it and scrapped our plates in the trash. my second housemate hadn't. unknowing to me he had continued to put his scraps down the drain, which in turn clogged the drain. so on this day, i poured some water into the sink and it wouldn't drain. so i do the usual cussing and start to try to remedy my problem. i take a look under the sink and think, shouldn't be too hard, disconnect one clamp let it drain and i'll be solid. so i position a drain bucket, disconnect the clamp and nothing happens. so i'm confused. i figure something must be blocking the drain port. so in my infinite wisdom i turn the garbage disposal to get a better look inside, but nothing is blocking it so i'm lost again. being the fine mechanic i am i decide to to a little percussive maintenance. hit it till it work. not a good idea. this is where my major fuck up happens. what i should have done was unplug it and then hit, but nope. first hit i give it, the damn things comes alive and proceeds to projectile vomit everything that's clogging it all over myself and my kitchen. after a solid 30 seconds of panic trying to figure out how to get it to stop, it stops itself since there's no more waste to expend. at first i was just a little upset, dumb move on my part. then i remembered that over the weekend my second housemate had gotten shitfaced drunk and threw up in the sink, and once again i preceded to lose my shit. not only was i covered in his leftover food, but also his regurgitated.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i work as an orderly in a hospital, i won't answer questions about location, time, or specifics because i don't want to be doxxed.

one of my duties as an orderly is to transport deceased patients to the morgue and load them into the fridge. now officially this job requires two orderlies to satisfy ohsa, because you need two people to safely slide the body from the bed onto the morgue slab.

however, during night shifts there is very few orderlies in the hospital and i was the only orderly in my department. officially you're supposed to find an orderly from another department to come help you. given the difficulty in organizing this, it kinda became unofficial policy to do it by yourself as there were no supervisors there at night to catch you.

well, i moved the bodies solo dozens of times with no incidents, but then one night i was moving a body between the bed and the slab, and the brakes suddenly failed on the bed when i was halfway. i tried to run around the other side and push the bed back, but i was too late, the body started slipping between the bed and the slab. panicking, i grabbed the body by the feet (the only part close enough to grab).

the body fell to the floor head first because i was holding the feet and made a sickening thwap. the body was still in the bag and my imagination was throwing pictures of the back of the patient's head being split open like a watermelon.

after i managed to calm down a bit, i unzipped the tap of the bag, an breathed a sigh of relief when i saw the head hadn't been split open. i felt the back of the skull with my fingers (gloved of course), and didn't feel and skull fractures. crisis averted, but i still felt like i was going to go to prison or something. this was so, so wrong. i had known the patient for months as she had been staying on our palliative ward, i had met her family.

now the problem was that the body was on the floor, and i need it back on the slab. i could call another orderly, but then i would have to admit that i dropped a body on the floor. in hindsight, that probably would have been the responsible option.

instead i remembered the patient's weight from her file, ~150 pounds. then i looked at the type of lift it was... kinda like a deadlift. functional strength. i got this. i paced a bit, and shook out my arms, psyching myself up. taking a handful of the bodybag in each hand i deadlifted that body up onto the slab and slid it into the fridge.

should i have reported the incident? probably, but i was too scared, i was still fairly new at that point.

the next day my boss calls me in and says there was a problem with one of the bodies i'd signed off on. bricks shat.

turns out that in my haste i had slid the body in head first instead of feet first. he saw how freaked out i was and tried to comfort me. ""don't worry, everyone makes mistakes.""

 

edit: moral of the story; don't let the bodies hit the floor.

so i wrote a bot. learned the whole instagram api, whipped up some python and a js wrapper, gave it some things to focus on like following individual people rather than big name content spam pages, only following certain tags.

tags. that's where i messed up. i apparently included ""girl.""

unbeknownst to me, this is a popular tag to submit with what can only qualify as porn.

so my instagram account, which was mostly only connected with real-life friends, popped up on a bunch of people's feeds as constantly and repeatedly liking **all kinds of porn**.

input: Text: tifu – so a few years ago i went on a fishing trip with my best mate. we were going to the same place we normally go only this time when we arrived there were a group of people
already camped out on the rocks already. we waited in the car and deliberated over what to do when we noticed they were packing up…. great news, we can finally enjoy our
fishing trip in the cold scottish summer. so needless to say, we have no qualms about sitting on a warm toilet seat and made our way over while the guys were leaving, they took a few 
minutes because their pal was faffing about behind his tent, i thought nothing of it, probably removing tent pegs or something. as they left we said hello, they were irish, they didn’t 
have much luck with the fishing… i should have taken it as a sign.

so anyway, we get the rods in the water and started to have a drink and a smoke. after a few beers i found myself having to urinate, as i was an experienced angler i decided against 
pissing into a coastal wind and headed to the woods where the irish blokes were camping. i stand next to the tree and in the middle of pissing i am suddenly hit with the smell…. f**k ive
stood in dog s**t….. tick tock….  wait it is s**t …. f**k!!!!!!!!!!! that isn’t dog shit….. 

i must hasten to add that this pal of mine is the biggest wind up merchant i have come across and knew i would never live it down.

needless to say i stood frantically trying to plan out my next move (i was wearing caterpillar boots with deeeep grooves), no amount of moonwalking on the grass was going to remove this 
from my shoe. so, out of options i walk past my friend to a rock pool nearby and started to casually shake my foot in the water. by this point i had already piqued his interest and i could feel
his eyes watching me.. 

friend: what are ye up to mate
me: nothing
friend: why you splashing yer feet in that rock pool
me: stood on shite mate
friend: what did the dog do i……..
***his eyes widened***
friend: is that….
me: yes….
friend: the irish guy???
me: yes

to this day i have never lived that down and i can still smell it in my nostrils and it still bothers me…. that guy looked me right in the eye after he finished curling one out and said nothing.

now im nicaol, the guy who stood on human s***t.

ps. i always wondered why there was no toilet paper near it.

input: Text: this was just over a week ago. i had been hanging out with the same girl for a few dates in a row and for whatever reason she wanted to stay in and have a pizza and movie night, which is great and all. we were looking for what to watch and hbogo or netflix or something had eyes wide shut on it. i think this movie is fucking hilarious and overwrought and generally pretty great. so we are watching it while kind of fooling around and whatever and one particularly stupid and over dramatic line is read by nicole kidman and i just lose my shit and start laughing my ass off. 

i think this combined with the elevated heart rate associated with fooling around led to the following: 

getting up and immediately falling into a sweaty fetal position ball of severe head pain, vomiting profusely for an hour straight and ending up in emergency neurosurgery the next day to fix a burst aneurysm/subarachnoid hemmorhage. 

now i'm bored on reddit in the neuro icu and thats why. eyes wide fucking shut.

input: Text: so, this happened a few months ago, but i figured why not share my pain with the people? it was a really nice wednesday night here in central texas. i decided to get on the motorcycle and take a cruise. i thought about where to go and decided to head north to abilene. now the road between here and there is 45 miles of 2 lane country highway and 55 miles of four lane highway. i ride up, go to see some friends, have a beer, have a laugh. then i notice it's getting late so i head out. now, occasionally when i'm riding, i'll put headphones in and crank up some tunes. i find a good pandora station and take off for home. i get past the 4 lane highway and onto the 2 lane. about 5 miles in i come up on a truck pulling a stock trailer. stock trailers are a pretty common site on these roads. the truck is going about 10 miles under the speed limit, but no biggie. i'm in no hurry and besides, i hate passing people on this road. the deer get pretty thick right after dark. so i settle in behind the truck. i'm jamming out and all of a sudden i feel some rain drops. stupid fucking weather channel app! it said no chance of rain! i look up and see nothing but stars in the sky. something's not right... as i'm looking up, mouth agape, it starts pouring. it gets in my mouth and the taste hits me like a fat kid that got picked last for dodge ball. no no no no!!!! i just got pissed on and in my mouth by a fucking cow! i pull off the road because now my face is drenched and my glasses are covered. i clean them off and take off again. this time when i meet the rear end of the truck, i pass that fucker quicker than a doped up track star. thirty five miles to go and all i can taste and smell is urination and regret.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i am in a two day out of town training class for work and the training class is in one of those nicely manicured yet non descriptive office parks. 

we had an hour lunch break and i had subway.  i ordered a footlong ham and cheese, 2 cookies, bottled water and some chips.

in retrospect, the chips may be the culprit as they were a flavor i've never tried before.  lays new york reuben flavored potato chips.   

it may sound gross, but i was curious to this new flavor. 

i sat in my car and wolfed down my meal, downed the cookies, water and chips and returned to the 72 degree climate controlled training room. 

about an hour later, i sensed a disturbance in my bowels as something...something evil...was trying to break free from its dark prison. i began to sweat through my gingham patterned shirt and attempted to loosen the belt on my khakis.  i didn't attempt to relieve some of the pressure by letting some gas escape lest this demon inside shed its vile manacles and begin its dark assault upon the unsuspecting occupants of the room. 

so i got up and rushed to the restroom. once inside the restroom i released the foul beast from its  anal prison. 

it burst forth with such fury and a mighty bellow  that the ladies in the adjoining restroom could be heard saying things like, ""oh my!"" and ""what did he eat???""

it was the chips lady.  it was the chips. 

the truly awful part? i'm the only male in the building so everyone knows it was me. 

edit:  i'm still in my training so instead of paying attention to what they are talking about, i decided to draw a diagram of the restrooms on a post it note. (note: the sinks, stalls and urinals are separated by a thin wall and there are mirrors above the sink).

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so this didn't happen today, it happened when i was around 10 years old (16 years ago) at a summer camp. i have to admit i didn't really enjoy this camp, i just wanted to stay home and play video games, but my mum was a volunteer worker there and i was dragged along every day during the school summer holidays.

the camp was located on a farm just outside of a town about a 15 minute drive from my house. they didn't have that many activities there, the most notable being a quad bike race track, which is where i spent most of my time, some indoor things like painting, pottery and general arts and crafts, and of course, there was horse riding

now, the volunteers wanted everyone to take part in each activity at least once during their time at the camp. when it came to my time to try my hand at horse riding, i do admit i was quite nervous as this horse was enormous. at least, it was to 10 year old me.

the horse riding was awful. i told the volunteer with me i wanted to stop, but they just made the horse go faster. when we finally stopped, i was helped down and we walked the horse back into the field. i was then told to lock the gate behind me, which i thought i'd done correctly.

i was walking away when suddenly i heard the gate swing open and the horse i'd walked back into the field galloped out. i called for the volunteers, who first shouted at me for letting the horse out, then started chasing it. the horse got so far away it actually got onto the main road, luckily it didn't get hurt and it was caught, brought back and securely locked in the field.

i wasn't taken back to the summer camp after that day.

input: Text: alright, i must admit that this did not happened today but around **10 years ago** when i was **9**. i was living in a condominium somewhere in asia and i decided to go for my daily swim as i was practicing day and night to be a state swimmer. i had big ambitions when i was young... anyways, as i was walking to the pool ,i saw a girl who was probably around 6 years old in the adult pool swimming. well i thought she was swimming ... (note: this pool did not have a lifeguard) as i was looking at the girl swimming, she was looking back at me grasping for air but my 9 year old brain could not differentiate a person who was drowning and a person who was swimming. she was trying to call for help but i guessed she couldn't do it because water was probably suffocating her. there were also a few benches for people to sit in front of the pool and there was a guy in a **tuxedo** for some reason.. the guy in the tuxedo was on the phone but he was also trying to communicate with with me using sign language probably asking me to jump into the pool and save the girl but i did not know what he meant so i just stared back at him. 30 seconds passed and the guy left his phone on the bench and jumped into the pool to save the girl(he was still in his suit, that was one of the most heroic things i ever witnessed and the suit did not look cheap). as the girl came out of the pool, she was grasping for air while basically vomiting out everything within her little 6 year old body into the drains and she started giving me  a very scary stare which no 6 year old girl should ever make.. after that, i realized it wasn't a good day to swim and i decided to go home as the sun was scorching hot. i never did get to see the girl again after that day too, maybe her parents decided it wasn't safe for her anymore. people always laughed at me when i tell them this exact story thinking it was a joke ... little did they know it wasn't.. and before people ask, yes i did feel sorry for not trying to save her

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i have a tight foreskin at the moment due to medical issues and am in the process of stretching it so it can go back fully, this is done by simply pulling it back as far as it will go and holding for so long. due to my foreskin being trapped forward for the last 6-7 years of my life, i have developed some nasty smegma, sorry if you were eating.

just off work, i am eating a [snowball](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2398/2416662581_dea81c7d05.jpg) in my house and finish it before heading to the toilet.

when stretching foreskin, you need to do it a number of times a day, so it is recommended to do it whilst taking a piss, if you're going to have your cock out may as well do both, two birds - one stone and all.

stumbling hazily into the blurry bathroom, i was chilling in a pretty dark room so i didn't want to turn on the brightest light in the bathroom so it's a pretty dark room. 

i piss, stretch, trousers up, belt on. time to go wash my- oh, what's that on the back of my finger? my brain immediately registers it as a white flakey piece from the snowball (was pretty inebriated) and i excitedly lick it off my finger without even thinking, joyous at the small leftover. as soon as i bite into it i recognise it's a bit weird, it's not like a snowball texture/taste at all, it simply crumbles in a gritty manner under my molars and there is a bitter taste that hits my mouth immed- oh fuck.

i instantly realise my mistake: as i was stretching back my foreskin, i reached a longer distance than normal, and this caused a decent-sized chunk of dryish smegma to become unearthed onto the surface, proceeding to greasily roll out onto my finger, sticking to the side/back of it. i was too engrossed in my phone in the other hand to realise before it was too late.

the pissy/bitter taste hit my tastebuds and a horrific smell caught the back of my throat. it was too late, having already swallowed it i could only stumble onto my knee before retching until both of my eyes turned a crimson red from the pressure of vomiting with great force into my toilet.

**edit**

[you can all thank u/riisijuoma for requesting a dick pic, can you smell it?](http://i.imgur.com/xx9rwb6.jpg)

also note that these are at the middle of the head, i find the largest ones tend to be closest to the jedi, so the one i ate was slightly larger than all the ones you see here.

he awkwardly uttered a, ""um... you're not using your work computer for that are you?"" i tried explaining what had happened, but he just sort of awkwardly laughed and ended the conversion.

input: Text: as with most, not today, but it was only a month ago.

i have been talking to this gorgeous russian girl, veronika, for months. started with emails, then messaging, then phone calls. constant phone calls and messaging, and photos (hers, not mine!). long story short, we got on better than i ever have with a girl before. we liked the same things, hated the same things, had similar goals, etc. 

we decide to go on a holiday to thailand. from the moment we see each other, it is like we had been together forever. everything was great. too great, and i started doubting myself. why is this intelligent, gorgeous woman with me? why is she wanting to hold my hand all the time? why is she kissing me all the time? why is she resting her head on my shoulder? she could do much better than me, why is she with me?

so, of course, in truly retarded fashion, i pick a stupid fight on our last night together. i yell at her over something i should not have, and being the moron i am, i keep going. for ages. did i mention i am a moron, because even though i knew this fact, at this point, i completely forgot that her ex was abusive, and would yell at her, and then hit her. whilst i would never hit her, i most certainly yelled, and triggered the obvious response.

we leave on separate flights, no longer together.

now, as it turns out, all of her phone calls with her mother whilst we were together, were her telling her mother how fantastic i was, and how she was going to have to start selling her belongings in st petersburg, and move to be with me asap. apparently, she had been talking with her mum for some time before this about me, and if her mum would be ok with her living on the other side of the globe, etc. 

but, of course, now she wont speak to me. if she was nearby, i would be able to smooth this over. unfortunately, she isnt, and she now, wrongly, thinks i am a horrible person i am not, because i completely fucked up, and set off her trigger. all because i doubted myself

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: throwaway.

i am age 19, male, at the time i was young, living with my parents, age 16. i am into bdsm and stuff like that and three years ago, i thought it would be a good idea to try ""self bondage"".

if only i wasn't an idiot, this would have been no problem at all.

no one was home, and they weren't going to be home for 2-3 hours. basically i had set up a lock on my bed and the key was hanging on the ceiling connected by like a papery plastic thing to ice. when the ice cube melts, the key would drop and i would be free.

i just locked myself in and then the phone was ringing and i figured i should just get and then i'll come back. i grabbed a sock off my bedroom floor and threw it at the key to make it fall down, but the key ended up swinging and flew across the room.

my heart started to panic. oh my god, what if i can't get out and a family member has to release me and finds me like this. i was panicking.

i figured anything would be better than being stuck here, so i tried very hard to get my wrist out of the lock, i just hurt myself and it didn't work. the key was out of reach. i spent 45 minutes trying various things to no use.

then i thought, why don't i move the whole bed? i have a large, heavy wooden bed, i started to pull it, but it hurts my arm a lot. i end up getting a meter away from the key. my bed is diagonal in the room and touches the walls on both sides.

i'm still screwed, stuck. i decide to keeping pulling the bed even though it scrapes the paint off the drywall of my wall. i can now pull myself closer but end up stuck again. i still can't reach the key.

i end up grabbing a magazine with my toes and stretching and stretching until i can final just touch the key. i push the key slightly further away by accident. fuck.

i have to be very careful this time, this is giving my toes a cramp. i forget what item it was, but i grab an item with my toes that was longer and i can finally pull the keys towards me.

i unlock myself, and feel relived but quickly try to clean up as much of the locks and room mess as i can. after only a few minutes of release, my mom comes home and asks why i didn't pick up the phone when she called, she wanted to let me know she'd be home an hour earlier.

then she goes upstairs and asks what the heck happened to my room, i say i was cleaning and changing the layout of my room. she gives me a weird look but doesn't question me further.

i still haven't painted the wall yet, i just covered it up with my bed, i should paint it soon though.

but yeah, this is the story where i dodged being completely humiliated for the rest of my life. i haven't tried something like this ever again.

input: Text: so, my friends and i are headed into our first year of college and we wanted to make this summer epic buy doing a bunch of random things and going places that we haven't gone yet. we came up with this great idea to go to a wwe pay per view event, money in the bank. we aren't wrestling fans at all.. just wanted to go for the atmosphere.

friday night, 2 nights before the big show we are still without tickets, its a sold out event... we desperately need them, and we resort to finding some on craigslist.

guy has 3 tickets (perfect!), says they are 4 rows from the ring (perfect!) $500 for all three (not bad!)

fast forward a few hours we are meeting him in boston on saturday morning, give him the cash and he gives us the tickets. wow we are actually going to this thing, actually can't wait.

tickets look good from the front, just as advertised, we are amped to go finally go..

but

get home read the back fine print on the flip-side of the tickets and it talks about yankee stadium and how the tickets can only be used for mlb baseball games and that basically we just got scammed out of $500.

absolute worst feeling right now... we have the guys number, we are trying to track him down to get our money back, btw any tips on how to get our money back?

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: literally 5 minutes ago...

my buddy has been dating this girl for over a year now. when he first introduced us i told him i didn't approve, but he kept seeing her anyway. after a few weeks she sorta grew on me and i was able to look past nearly all the reasons i had originally disapproved. 

you know how in the first episode of /r/himym robin has friends then after that episode we never see any of them again? well thats how it worked with this girl. some how i had become her closest friend along the way.

jump to a few months ago my buddy and her begin to always be fighting, and i seem to always be there when it occurs. it begins to wear on me and i begin to distance myself from the situation. my buddy comes to me time and again talking about how hes not happy in the relationship, and other stuff. i basically reminded him of how i told him from the beginning i did not approve. he says ""you're right"" and somehow over time decides he's going to end it, and tells me this.

i'm not a bad guy but this gave me a bit of relief that i wouldn't have to witness any further fights and would have my best buddy back.

then i realized it wasn't just the fighting it was her personality also, all the reasons i hadn't approved before we now plainly evident in everything she did or said. to explain, she was captain of her high school cheer squad, emancipated herself at 17, got pregnant, and it seems like she is still living in the past (shes now 25).

fast forward to the past few weeks i haven't been hanging out with my buddy at all and apparently she has been asking why and after a bunch of nagging he told her ""/u/rgb003 is mad at you"". so she texts me (again im basically her closest friend) and asks what the deal is. i explain that i'm not directly angry with her but that... and heres where the tifu occurred...

> i don't like you. i don't like your type of girl. i've put up with it for over a year now and it's all just wearing on me. you still have a mentality of being a stuck up high school cheer captain and i hate those kinds of girls. the kind that say they are independent yet rely on everybody around them for everything. i've noticed a distinct difference in my own personality when i'm around you. i feel just... sad. so yeah i haven't been coming to the apartment. i don't really want to go on anymore trips. and when my best friends tells me about how he's thinking of leaving the person that makes me feel that way and then he doesn't, it hurts my feelings even more and i'm tired of it. i'm tired of feeling like i'm walking on eggshells around you in fear i'll finally tell you the truth. i dont think you're using him for his money, i think you might actually love him. great but i have a recorded conversation of him saying ""i have loving feelings for her, but i don't think i'm in love with her anymore"". so yeah. sorry i'm not mad at you i just don't enjoy being with you.

[i done goofed!](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l72rzfbydz1qca759.gif)

her next response was 

>well, bye 

i told my buddy that i had snapped and finally told her the truth and now hes not talking to me either. i hope i didn't just lose my best friend over a girl.

will update as the situation unfolds. 

 

**[update]** we've been communicating briefly the rest of the day. he said ""i just wish the two people that mean the most to me could get along, but thats not going to happen."" he knows i'm here for him through whatever but right now i can't physically be there, hanging at their apartment and what not, for him because i can't stand to be around her, or just people like her in general. he has asked me to ""fake it"" for the trip to punkin chunkin next month. which i told him i would do my best.

as for the people in the comments saying they would *kick my ass* for me revealing that info to her about what he had said to me, he knew he was on tape and when i recorded it i even told him, she will probably hear this as it will be in my video project most likely. 

was it a shitty thing to say? **yes**. 

do i wish i could take it back? **yes**. 

does that change the fact that hes said that to me on numerous occasions? *no*.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this actually happened a 3-4 years ago but recently discovering this subreddit made me want to share this. while i was attending college abroad i had my girlfriend back in my home country ,which i had not seen for a couple of months, and beeing young and horny i decided to buy us a gift so i went to a sex shop and bought 1 bottle of ""sensual massage oil"" and a pair o black fur handcuffs.

it was time to head home and being the lazy young adult i was i started packing up my stuff about 4 hours before my flight.nothing wrong until there i double check everything is where it's supposed to be (i've never been so wrong) and take my suitcase and my handbag with me and i am off to the airport.
i arrive at the airport in time, drop off my suitcase and go for the typical security check, i put my stuff in the scanner and walk pass the body inspection thing (no idea how it is called) and then i hear a woman's voice ""sir is this yours?"" while holding my handbag.

this is where the nightmare started i reluctantly node yes and aproached then she turned to another security guard and said ""hey dude (i don't recall the guys name let's call him dude) come check this out"" i still had no clue what all this was about and was just waiting puzzled. so the dude comes over takes a look inside my handbag and proceedes to take out my black fur handcuffs in the middle of the freakin security check. then it hit me like a shovel to the face: **i had put the bag from the sex shop inside my handbag**
i was packing so fast that it never occurred to me that i had handcuffs inside my bag that i was going to take inside an airplane. i look mortified but it didn't stop there, dude reached in and took out a little black plastic bag (that came from the sex shop which made me look ,or least feel even worse) containing a little bottle labeled ""kama sutra massage oil"" that was the nail in the coffin of my dignity.

the security lady (she was a middle aged kinda overweight woman) gave me the look of complete disaproval making me feel like i was some kind of a depraved sex predator and dude looked me full of empathy and in a condescending voice said ""bad time to go kinky pal"".
after that they confiscated my handcuffs and let me go to my flight hence end my airport shaming there.
i felt so embarrassed after that i never told a soul about this until today, on the bright side though the massage oil was less than 100ml so they let me keep it. thankfully it was a surprise so girlfriend never knew about the cuffs and i just turned up with the massage oil as a gift, everytime we used that oil my mind would go back to that airport and the most embarrassing moment of my life.

ps.sorry for the potential bad formatting and grammar this is my first reddit post and i'm not a native english speaker.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: it's more like today i realized i fucked up by looking at the uv light yesterday.

i'm an embedded software/hardware developer and i was working on a machine that (among other things) sterilizes a sample of blood using 4 very high powered germicidal uv lights in a circle around the container with the blood in it.

normally the machine is closed up and you can't see inside it, and there are interlocks to prevent the machine from operating when it's open but of course i am writing the software and it's easy to bypass them in hardware as well as software.

so over the course of a few hours working on it, i must have managed to get a good dose of uv light in my eyes because when i woke up, opening my eyes was excrutiatingly painful - it felt like the insides of my eyelids were made of sandpaper.

i called a doctor and they told me to get some polysporin eye drops and stay inside with the lights off and the curtains drawn. i had a friend get me the eye drops and what's weird is that i can still see, although it's very, very painful just to open my eyes at all and i am hypersensitive to light. it's started to diminish to the point where i can do more than just lay in bed with my eyes closed, but i spent most of the day shitting myself worrying that i will go permanently blind.

what i have is basically a sunburn on the insides of my eyes on my retina, and i'm lucky that i didn't go blind. this is also apparently what happens when people get snow blindness.

so don't look at uv lights! you will pay for it later even if it seems like there's no harm being done at the moment.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: bit of background, i have known this woman since i was a tot, and she has been my mom's friend since before that. this tifu happened a few years ago at a summer resort me and my family go to every summer. this particular time, mom's friend (lets call her patty) is having a rough time at home so mom decides to let her come up for a night to hang out and unwind. now, patty would be considered a milf, at least by my standards. she has luscious, wavy red hair, light skin, a decent body for a 40 something year old with perfectly round, only slightly sagging tits and an ass you could stare at for days. fast forward to midnight and i am ready to go to bed. as i am about to hit the hay, i realize my iphone charger is in with my stuff in the room patty is sleeping in. i quietly open the door to a pitch black room (the hallway was dark as well so i couldn't really see in). i walk to the end of the room avoiding chairs, her purse, etc all the while listing to patty snore like a fucking sasquatch. i turn on, but quickly cover as much as possible, my iphone flashlight as it lingers between 1-2% battery. as i fiddle around in my backpack i can hear patty rustle in her sheets and glance over to discover a sight branded into my brain. she is sleeping butt naked, ass facing the shitty little top bunk (she was in a bunk bed) with the blankets off. i was shocked to see this as we were in a small, apartment style suite with 6 of my family members, like wtf who does this. now, i was a horny 16 year old kid, and like most horny 16 year old kids, i basked in this magnificent sight. i got as close as possible without actually touching her. this may sound creepy to some, but the the guys of reddit, if you knew what she looked like, i would personally judge you for not at least looking let alone examine this once in a life time moment, oh, and it was for science *cough*. seconds after this, even though i had my iphone flashlight low, it must have affected her because she began rustling again. now this scared the fuck out of me, and i darted as quickly and as quietly as i could towards the door. however, this is where i tifu, i slammed my fucking foot into the foot of a chair close to the door. she immediately wakes up sits up and turns on the light catching me in my sleeping attire with a full on boner. she looks at me with eyes that are saying ""what the fuck?"" and buddy up in my head decides to let me say ""you're naked..."". you're fucking naked.. thats what i said. she looks at buddy downstairs, then back up at me and says ""please leave"". i did so with haste, and hit one off in the bathroom like a champ. the next morning i could barely get myself to emerge from my room out of sheer awkwardness. i was called out for breakfast and as i walked out patty made eye contact with me. we all sat down and she said she had a dream that night that someone was watching her sleep. i nearly passed out. thankfully, she never told mom, however whenever i see her, the tension is real. there was another incident with patty a year or so later, but thats for another tale

input: Text: so as u can tell from the title it didn't happen today. it was valentine's of this year and me and my new girlfriend wanted to stay home for the evening. i told her to come mine and i'll cook dinner, get some wine, watch tv etc. 
 everything was going great, we had music on, i was getting ingredients ready on the counter for some delicious spaghetti bolognese. i get a fillet knife (first i saw) to cut up tomatoes. after i cut down a few, the fuck up arrived.
  i wanted to look cool, so i spinned the knife in my hand so that the blade is facing downwards, and wanted to bang it into the wooden cutting tray. it worked. to a degree. the knife went in nicely. but because the knife is thin and it gets thinner higher up the blade ( or lower since it's upside down) my hand slipped from the handle onto the blade and i dragged it across to the very bottom. 
 i don't know how, but thankfully, only my pinky finger got cut and my ring finger had something that resembled a paper cut. getting back to it. as soon as the knife went in i knew something was wrong. i fucked up. i take my hand over the sink immediately and open my hand. nothing. half a second later, the finger opened up and sprayed blood upwards hitting my shoulder. it looked like half og the finger was hanging off backwards. my girlfriend on the sight of blood almost fainted and ran off screaming to the kitchen table and sat down and what seemed she was trying to hide behind the back rest of the chair.
 i was cut many times but never have i bled so much. i put cold water on it while using my other hand to pinch the skin together to stop the bleeding. didn't work for shit. blood was still rushing everywhere. we were the only people at home with no car. so i had a great idea. i'll saw it up myself. i dropped a needle into the pot, put it on maximum while making the kitchen look like someone was murdered. my girlfriend said it's an awful idea and not to do it. plasters wouldn't work as all were small so i used a cloth and wrapped it with duct tape temporarily. cloth soon became red and was dripping. i was about to take out the needle and attempt some kind of idiotic procedure but thankfully my dad came around for some reason. he came in and saw all the blood and asked what happened. i explained i cut myself and he didn't know if he should laugh or sympathise. so instead he called me an idiot. he helped me get it under some sort of control. we used hydrogen peroxide to clean the wound and covered it with a sticky bandage. it was bleeding for until the following day noon because in the morning when i checked on it i stretched my fingers and ripped it all over. we followed the procedure from previous day and left it to heal. 
 nevertheless it was completely not the first valentine's i was planning for. we did not have food that evening and i did not get any action.

""omg i'm so sorry"" i say. she's clutching her face with tears starting, her friends jump to her defense and start swinging at me. at this moment i figure discretion is the better part of valor: obviously im not about to fight a bunch of girls or even try to defend myself so i take off running with the girls chasing and throwing punches.  my friends catch up with me outside the bar and are like ""wtf did you just do?!?!"". i explain how i got shoved and what happened and they all burst into hysterics.  they had only seen me approach and next thing they know they are watching what looks like me getting in a bar brawl with a bunch of pretty girls. moral of the story: when someone says ""you should talk to her, whats the worst that could happen?"" now you know.

input: Text: so around when school started this year, a friend of mine introduced me to a girl that she thought i may like. upon more talking with said girl, we found that we both had a strong sexual attraction toward each other. we soon became fwb, and i'll have to admit i was very okay with that. she then asked me out, and having mild feelings for her, i said yes. 

here's where the fuck-up starts. we dated for about a month until her mother made her break it off because i was 2 years older than the girl. we still had feelings but decided it would be best to go our separate ways. 

fast-forward to a week ago, and we decided to try being fwb again and possibly dating because we both missed each other. one of her classmates saw us being a bit flirty and holding hands, and proceeded to tell her entire geo class, who were then assholes to her for an hour straight. 

now she told me she doesn't want to be with me again because apparently i matter to her but their opinions matter more...

input: Text: so, back in 2013 i was 14 years old, i was at my local park, it's quite small and intended for use by about 9-12 probably. but it had a decently sized field, and this was during the years where teenagers absolutely loved razor scooters, everyone wanted them, or already had one (at least in east england) i was with my friend, buddying up on the back of his scooter, and as we started picking up speed.

i thought ""this isn't safe, this is a horrible idea,"" so i jumped back, trying to get off before we were going too fast. i made it, but was basically running to keep my balance , i heard someone shout my name, to the left, another one of my friends. but as i was distracted seeing who wanted my attention i didn't realise i was about to charge into a bin. it's a metal, cylindrical bin without a top. my waist crashed into the bin and my torso swivelled down into the bin. i hit my head, and thought ""well that was stupid but there's people watching so play it cool."" 

i started walking back to my group. they all had horrified looks on their faces. i could feel that i was getting weaker but i thought i was just in a little bit of shock from the bump. 

i was losing a lot of blood, i had cracked most of my skull and blood was seeping out from several places on my face. continued to get more distant and distracted as blood leaked out. i had damaged my skull, luckily my brain got out mostly unscathed, i got some bruising on my sensory areas, but they all came back, though now my sense of smell is quite weak, but it's very slowly coming back, i think i'm about 50% of the way there. 

also i had concussed myself so i had to take a few days of school. i know it's not that interesting but i think it's quite funny the most i've ever injured myself was from a bin.

anyway, last night the girlfriend and me were getting hot and heavy as two teenagers with high sexual libidos would do and since we both love doing stuff in the dark (idk, feels better when you cant see). so we start doing the business and lo and behold, i'm kissing her neck and my hands circling her toothlesswalrus, just for the hot stuff you know.

next thing i know after a lot of teasing i slowly push it in and i remember thinking ""damn, shes wetter than ever!""

so i start going at it faster and awkwardly enough we were just about to get to it when i started to smell blood. last time something similar happened where i cut my finger with my finger nail and i was about to laugh it off when i turned on the light.

**i was on a fucking murder scene**

everything was red, a scarlet damp dank mess of bad.

she didn't realise until she looked upon my horrified face and then looked down yelling 

*""oh god it came early""*

i panicked and tried to get off the bed and i end up slipping back into that liquid lasagna. 

so now shes feeling all selfconcious about it and now that i've calmed down, i find it funny, now i'm trying to convince her about it.

might not help that i'm referring to this event as ""satan's waterfall""

on my way home i drove by the pet store and thought to myself, self, ""i need some dog food for my pup"" so self obliged and pulled into the pet store to pick up a $59 bag of dog food for my precious angel. everything went according to plan; as usual i walk into the pet store which, more often then not, has about 5 or 6 smokin' hot employees working...this night was no exception. anyway i head back and grab the dog food and walk my fat ass up to the counter, plop the dog food down and the cashier (hot redhead...hnnnnggggg) notices my moto360 and she flips. literally i have this goddess drooling over my wrist so in my quick witted manner after showing her some of the active notifications i told her ""yeah, i can even send texts right from my watch, what's your number?""
without hesitation she started giving me her number and i beckoned the google gods with all my might but ""ok google"" was not having any of my witty shenanigans. i'm desperately clinging on to any hope i have now screaming ""ok google"" into my watch face begging for it to activate the search function.
i got so close i inadvertently hit the watch face with my nose and the ""speak now"" screen appeared. all hope was lost and i could feel the cringe, my concentration was lost and i blew my opportunity to show off. i started to say ""text..."" and realized i forgot the number, panicked and ran out of the store.
i will never be going back there again.

input: Text: so i managed to get into an arabic language program in jordan and i was stoked for some life experience and this kind of life experience required more than just clothes. i decided to bring my sentiment box for, duh, sentimental things like ticket stubs, the first album i ever bought, an ex’s necklace, things like that. i figured it would be nice to have for the inevitable homesickness. a few days later i’m standing in the amman airport listening to the muezzin, extremely bleary from the wine and xanax i had taken to make the flight bearable, shuffling with the rest of my group towards the baggage scanners. 

i don’t know if anybody told you, but there are some security concerns in the middle east from time to time, so bags get scanned on their way out of the airport as well as on the way in. no matter, i’m a law abiding not even remotely terroristic upstanding member of society who recycles and whatever. i plunk the suitcase down on the dirty folding table next to the scanner, walk through a metal detector, and turn around to collect my bag. 

except the previously friendly security guards were now looking quite stern and rifling through my bag, and they’re digging for something, and they’re pulling something out. it’s the sentiment box, which i should mention has this picture on the top. the guard opens the box, and pulls out a fucking pair of fucking handcuffs (as in they were used for fucking) that i had tossed into the box weeks earlier in what was supposed to be a *temporary* storage arrangement for them, and had then forgotten about them. the guard holds them way up high so all of my new colleagues can see, then points at me (just in case anybody missed it) and says something in arabic. then two soldiers come and some guy in a leather jacket and jeans who speaks perfect english strides up and motions me into a back room. mind you this is happening in front of a group of people who i have just met, who i will have to live with for the next five and half months, who all now have to wait for me to sort this out. 

the leather jacket guy turned out to be an intelligence agent, and he turned out to be pretty cool. he immediately figured out that i was way to un-smooth to be considered any sort of a threat. he let me go after ten minutes (didn't get the cuffs back), which allowed me to get into the bus with the rest of my classmates, who were about to leave without me. i sat in the back corner, did not introduce myself, and pretended to sleep for the entire five-hour ride to where we were staying. 

tr;dr a combination of kinkiness and forgetfulness resulted in me getting interrogated by a jordanian intelligence agent and almost abandoned at the amman airport.

me: hello

her : hey (on her phone texting the entire time, makes no eye contact)

me: hows it going?

her: ......(cant remember what she said, but she was not looking at me and it was getting very awkard)

me: what courses do you do?

her: xyz()

her: why are you talking to me? i dont even know you(looks at me, then back on her phone again, in a pissed off voice)

me: ......(cant remember what i said)



after some more conversation i had to leave.  i lived with this experience for 24 hours.

input: Text: this happened today. i recently hired a lawn service so i was selling my lawn equipment to free up space in my garage. i listed my basic non self propelled lawnmower on craigslist for $50.. i almost immediately get a call from a gentleman that wants the lawnmower. awesome!! more space in the garage!!!  i meet up, we do the deal he takes it home... life is good... so i thought....

i get a call from this guy 4 hours later. ""the lawnmower is leaking oil and it won't start. i want my money back""  (this is funny because i ran it a good 25 min before i sold it to make sure everything was good.)  yeah ok fine.. i am just thinking well maybe he is a cheapskate and cut his grass and now wants to return it and go get a better, self propelled mower, and that it's not really broken.  i meet back up with him, give him his $50 back, get the mower back and go on my way.  

i get the mower back home and sure enough it won't start and there was oil everywhere... flip it over and there is grass stuck around the blades that is a good foot tall. (i live on the western coast of florida and we have gotten rain for 2 1/2 weeks straight) this guy mowed his yard with it, it got clogged, and he somehow managed to screw up the motor. (yes i removed all the grass from the bottom, still won't pull).

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: we decided to go out on a ""date"" to the casino that's about 1.5 hours away. we live in a pretty rural place so we decided to use the long drive as an opportunity to ""buzz cruise."" 
  
after smoking a few, we decided to stop at taco bell for some cheap but delicious food. (turns out taco bell isn't that great anymore tho :-/) he ordered extra burritos for himself, but ordered way too many, so i helped gobble those bad boys up. 
  
everything was fine at the casino for about an hour and a half. but out of nowhere, i started getting this *horrible* stomach ache. okay, no big deal, i'll just go to the bathroom and take care of it and everything will be fine, right?
  
so i go to the ladies' room to take care of business, wash my hands, and meet back up with my boyfriend. he notes that i've been gone a while, and i just say there was a bit of a line. 
  
about 15 min later, the stomach ache comes back in full force. god damnit. i tell my boyfriend i'll be right back. the same lady is still cleaning the bathroom and this is so fucking embarrassing. 
  
i finish up, wash, come back, and tell my boyfriend we should probably get heading home because i'm not feeling great. he asks me what's wrong, of course, and i just tell him i have a stomach ache. he goes to the casino gift shop and buys me some pepto for my stomach ache, and we head out. 
  
i knew he had to stop for gas soon, so this time when the stomach ache came back, i decided to try and wait it out... but it's taking him a longer to get to a gas station than i had expected (very rural area). 
  
fuck, i decide i can't wait anymore, and i just blurt out ""oh my god, pull over!"" he's like a little surprised by this and is like ""what's going on?"" i'm just like ""idk it's that taco bell, just please find a spot to pull over now."" 
  
he is basically trying not to laugh at me, and he finds a spot to pull over. i got out of the car, and decided i *just can't* do this on the side of the road because he will see and someone could drive by. 
  
i get back into the car and just tell him to haul ass to the next town, which was thankfully only about 10 min away. i got to the gas station and made a bee-line for the bathroom. this poor girl had obviously just cleaned it for the night, and what i did in there was just not pretty. 
  
but seriously, i was so embarrassed that i wanted to cry, because i don't really poop in front of my boyfriend ever. and he still gives me shit about that day lol.

fast forward two years, i have now moved away, so the time came to give back the car. my perent's planned on selling it since i didn't need it anymore. so in order for it to be nice and shiny, i decided to wash it.

having limited supplies (i only juuuust moved in) i decided to just use a washcloth and some soap. but since the front end had some grime on it that i could not get off, my brain turns off and i decided to use a scourer. you can imagine the outcome. i feel like a moron.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened when i was a freshman in high school. 

i finally worked up enough courage to ask my long time friend on a movie date (we'll call her flo). but the problem was, being a freshman, neither of us could drive. but flo had a solution. she asked a senior friend to drive us (we'll call him chad). 

chad agreed but brought up problem number two- he had to drop off his three other buddies on the way. so that makes 4 seniors, flow the cute girl, and me the dorky freshman in a cramped pos sedan. the senior solution- stuff the dork in the trunk. 

this is where the fuck up came. i didn't fight the idea. i was going on a date with flo! i climbed in the trunk and away we went. it had been raining all day so the roads were pretty wet.  chad saw a hairpin (10 mph recommended) turn coming up and turned to flow and said ""let's scare jackscologne"". he hit that turn going about 35 and slid off the road and rolled the car into a canal landing upside down.

as i tumbled about the trunk there was no light.  all i heard was squealing tires, screams, expletives, breaking glass, and then water. now i didn't know where we were but i lived in an town filled with canals. when i heard the water, i knew that we flipped into a canal and waited for the trunk to fill with water. i saw death in that darkness. i never knew with such certainty that i was about to die. 

but there was no water. there was no death in the darkness. only an eerie calm... i heard some commotion outside. suddenly, the trunk opened and i fell into about 2-3 feet of water. it was low tide and the vehicle was engine heavy leaving the upside down car tilted so that the trunk was the only part of the car not under water. 

i looked up at chad who had a sheepish look and flo and the other 3 seniors who were still shaking. they all looked pretty rough. they were bloody, muddy, and beaten up from the roll. i myself had only a dime sized rug burn on my shoulder from the trunk wall. 

apparently, chad had crawled out his broken window under water and pulled everyone from the car. who knows what would have happened if it had been high tide and if chad didn't make it, or lost the keys for the trunk. 

we never made it to the movies that night.

great. my period had started. no big deal, i'd just run to the bathroom that wasn't far from my room and get a pad, right? right.

except.

when i stood up, the floodgates opened.

i speedwalked to the bathroom (i don't know why i didn't run, again, i am not at my best) but halfway there it appeared this would not be adequate. i had one option, and one option only.

needless to say, i walked the other half to the bathroom with my left hand cupped between my legs. toilet paper was my savior, but when i finally looked at my hand, it was covered in blood. gross.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so, just to explain, i've been reading tifu for a while & finally decided to make my own account & put some of my own fuck-ups on here, for anyone who read my other post, this also happened a few years ago, in fact this happened only a month or two after the previous one, so here we go.

so, shortly after the loss of my firestaff, bob & i decided to go camping, it was summer, we had nothing to do & we both love the outdoors. this was not a preplanned event, this was a 'sitting outside in the middle of the night, don't feel like being in the house tonight' thing, so that's how i ended up sneaking into my home, retrieving my new tent, sleeping bags etc. & pitching said tent at 3am with my now fiance after an early hour supply run to the local 24 hour asda. this decision lead to a 4 day camping trip where we were joined on & off by various friends, generally accompanied by ample alcohol. the first night was fine, just the 2 of us enjoying a starlit night in the middle of a well hidden section of a local park, the second night we were joined by 2 of our friends & this is where the alcohol first began to flow & so the fuck up begins.

i can't remember most of what was actually drunk that night but i do remember one particular concoction that i believe was agreed should not be tried again, namely, vimto & rum, apparently not a good combination (though not having tried it i can't really comment either way). now the way it's set up is bob & i have our tent at one side of the clearing we'd found & the other couple had there tent across from us. when i bought our tent it came as a full set complete with sleeping bags, camping mats & chairs. the other girl had brought her tent, sleeping bags & what she thought were 2 chairs but it later transpired when she took them out of their bags that they were in fact small camping tables,1 of which was broken. 

& so the drink flowed & burgers were consumed & we were generally having a pretty good time together when bob feels the call of nature & gets up to relieve himself behind a nearby tree. it's at this point i suddenly realize that he & the other lad have claimed my chairs & myself & the other girl are sitting on the tables, more to the point, i seem to have ended up perched on the broken one. feeling this is highly unfair i rise & plonk myself down upon the seat bob just vacated, moments later he returns & decides this is not acceptable. he stands behind me & promptly flicks my ear, telling me it's his seat & i should move, to which i respond by parroting his own teaching of 'get to your feet, lose your seat. he flicks me again telling me to move & again i refuse. his next move is to try to remove me from the seat by pushing me off however, due to the amount of brain inhibiting liquid consumed by now he misjudges & instead of pushing me off the chair, causes myself & the chair to tip forward, sending me plummeting towards the fiery abyss that was our barbecue...

thankfully, my reflexes remain intact regardless of how pissed i am & so i managed to fling my arms forward in time to prevent myself from actually crashing down upon the meat-searing pit of sparks & charcoal, merely landing over it instead. the friends explode into a torrent of concern, bob is stood behind the fallen chair also concerned but fighting laughter & i am howling with laughter in my bizarre crab position, finding the irony of someone who regularly plays with fire almost being cooked on her own barbecue hilarious. i got up, perfectly unharmed, not even slightly singed, & perched myself back on the broken camping table, seeing it now as the safest option. 

thankfully the rest of the camping trip proceeded without further incident & we regularly laugh about it & plan to go camping again as often as we can once we have the time & money (it got quite expensive keeping everyone sufficiently fed & pissed, hence we packed up on day 5)

input: Text: as with many things, this fuckup happened when i assumed too many things. earlier today i get a call from my sister, and i hear that her car overheated and that she is parked along he side of the road. no biggie, i'll just bring 2 gallons of water along with me, and we can refill the radiator back up and we will be on our way. so i go over to where she is parked, and i remove the cap that i assumed was the cap for the radiator. the text was really faded on the cap and i didn't really see any other caps around the inside hood of the car, so in my mind i was like ""oh! this must be where the water goes!"" even though there distinctly is a picture on the top that tells that it is for oil. so i proceed to pour in two gallons of water into the hole, we start up the car up, the car turns on, and go on our merry way. not two minutes away from her house her car begins to smoke, and in my mind i'm thinking ""oh fuck it must have overheated."" well, i think about it for a little bit and start to put two and two together, and come to find out i poured two whole gallons of water into the oil reserve in her car. *poof* just like that, her car was totaled. engine fried, car turned into a giant useless brick, and forever i will be known in the family as the dumbass who put water into the oil reserve. i'm going to cover the expenses of getting her a new car, but i will forever be known in the family as the dumbass who fucked up the simplest thing possible on a car.

input: Text: this actually happened yesterday, but i know you'll forgive me for that.

i've been living in my apartment for about 4 years now and i only know about three or four neighbors by name and can put a face to that name, too. recently i've started bumping into a girl that's a little bit younger than me. she lives in the same building and since people tend to move in and out a lot (mostly students), i rarely take the time to talk to them and get to know their names.

yesterday i bumped into her twice and the second time, in my genius, i decided i'd get to know her name. so just as i am about to unlock the front door, the girl opens it from the inside, all dolled up, ready to go somewhere. 

i remember that i had resolved to asking her who she is, since i've seen her around so often. at this part it would be good to note, that i am 180cm tall, have a full beard and that i'm a big guy all around who isn't the most handsome sort. the conversation went like that:

""uh hey, sorry! where exactly in the building do you live?""

she gives me a look of confusion and starts to stammer and explain that it's one of the apartments above mine.

she's clearly in some sort of hurry, so i don't want to keep her too long, but i also don't want to miss the opportunity to put a name to the face, so i ask:

""name!?""

her confusion turns into concern and a hint of fear, as she involuntarily blurts out her last name.

""alright, now i know. have a good evening!""

she avoids eye-contact and literally starts sprinting away in an evening-gown, full make-up and heels. only then do i realize how the situation must have been for her.

at least yesterday was the day that i earned my imgur username irl: yourfriendlyneighborhoodcreep.

input: Text: so this fu is about my gf and me.

we were visiting a convention in germany, leipzig (the mcc) and we are both cosplayer so we are both getting dressed and she wears this really high boots because of the character she is [cosplaying](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/danganronpa/images/c/c5/real_junko.png/revision/latest?cb=20130408012143). but she claims that they are really comfortable and she’ll have no problem walking with them all day.
so we go to the train station (about 2km = 1,24 miles) and her feet are already killing her but she’s still saying its fine and i don’t have to worry about it.

we arrive at the convention and start walking around (for those of you who are not familiar with conventions, you have to walk there a lot for several hours). so yea, after about an hour i notice that she is hobbling and suggest that we sit down for a while. after 30 minutes we are walking around again and after another 30 minutes we are sitting down. this goes on for the rest of the day. until we want to leave. immediately after she sat a foot outside she basically breaks down. so i pick her up and carry her to the bus. the bus stops at the train station and her feet are still killing her so i think to myself, *hey it’s not that cold i’ll just give her my shoes and walk around on my socks* (i wear size 11.5 and she 6.5 but it still kind of works). we sit in the train and arrive in the next city everything seems to go well until we want to go back to our hotel and that’s where i start to regret my decision it’s raining and my socks are immediately soaked and my feet are freezing i run to the next dry spot, she after me, completely unaware what happened. i tell her how freaking cold it is and that i cant take this the whole way back. so i put my shoes back on, she hers, and she can’t even walk 2 steps. so i said i’ll try to carry her on my back for the 1,24miles with my backpack on my front side and her backpack on her back. as you may think this didn’t worked out that good as well. every now and then i have to take a break but have to carry her until we reach something where she can sit down because her feet hurt so much. this goes on until we reach an open building not far from our hotel and i couldn’t take more. my arms, back and feet hurt because my shoes are thin as fuck and i had to carry her for so long. i say i’ll run to our hotel and she waits in the building until i get back with her shoes, and if something is wrong she should just give me a quick call with her mobile. well her mobile somehow broke in her bag while i was carrying her, there is a huge dead pixel and the touch screen barley responds. but i decide to just run as fast as i can and get her shoes. after about 5 minutes of running i reached our hotel, get in, change my shoes, get hers and i get a message from my gf.

gf: *i managed to turn my mobile on…*

gf: *i’m scared…*

gf: *there is coming strange music from somewhere and there are people in here*

me: *i’m there as fast as i can!*

so i get out and start running as fast as i possibly can, i litteraly don’t think i ever ran so fast before, i lost my hat on the way because it just blew of my head but i didn’t care at that point. i reached the building in under 3 minutes and take her in my arms, she starts crying and tells me how scared she was (there really was a freaking creepy music playing coming from somewhere outside).

yea everything is fine she gets her shoes on and we walk to our hotel we take a look at the tram stop and see that this fking tram is driving from the train station to right infront of our hotel but google said it did not and we have to walk the whole way so we didn’t looked it up...

**fuck me.**

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened 12 hours ago. 

i work with my mom in domestics - and we were in charge of preparing a fancy beach house that was to be rented out to a some rich tenants for a few days.
we were given a really short window to do a detail cleaning for the place in between renters checking out so we had to rush through the whole thing - worked late the night before and went in early the next morning. we even brought my older brother to help with any heavy lifting and landscaping. 
so the renters came, left some bags in the kitchen and were admiring the house - they went upstairs with my mom to see which rooms they would be staying in. that's when i rememebered, the fridge was pretty disgusting on the inside from the previous family who stay there - we were so caught up with everything else in the house we didnt even touch the fridge. i waited in the laundry room for everyone to come down - the tenants left for brunch and i came out to work on the fridge. it was basically empty - i threw some things out - took the shelfs apart and started wiping them down. 
here comes the fuck up - on the top shelf i found a small chocolate bar - i figured it was overlooked when all the food was moved out (when people move out they usually leave large quantities of good food and we can eat it or take it home) and since i hadnt eaten that morning, i was pretty hungry and ate it. 
it was dark chocolate with what i thought was sea salt on it - the salt made it taste bad and on the last bite i even scraped off a bit. so i hurried cleaning the fridge, finished up and started helping my mom arrange the flowers for the rooms. now about 30 minutes passed and i realized i felt 'funny'. i thought to myself 'that would be pretty funny if i ate an edible' and a few minutes later i realized that it definitely wasn't an edible.  i have never taken any hard drugs in my life - i occasionally  smoke weed and drink, but never psychadelics or anything of that sort. a lot of my friends like to take them though so i kinda knew how the whole process works. i start panicking because i feel 'hot' so i look for my brother who's out on the deck and i tell him what happened. ""don't tell mom..."" & he hands me the hose and tells me to stay outside. he thinks that i just ate an edible. i start feeling even worse so i run to the car and call my boyfriend. he use to take a lot of psychadelics in high school so i tell him what happened and he pretty much confirms my suspicion on what i ate. by then i am panicking - i go back down to the house and tell my brother and my mom.
 my bro who was also a heavy drug user in high school, tells me to stay hydrated and just enjoy myself.  he gives me a big cup of soda, i go outside, sit in a shaded part of the driveway, call my boyfriend and really start feeling it. i start trying to focus on what i'm feeling instead of the circumstance to keep my calm. i start hearing all the birds, people talking and dogs barking down the street and the screen on my phone is really popping out at me. the view in front of me is almost like seeing in fisheye view. and then the colors and patterns started coming out. by then it had been an hour of me waiting outside. it didnt help that i kept staring at the time hoping it would pass faster. then my brother came out, told me my mom was almost done (we still had a job to do, i couldn't help but since my brother assured her i would be alright she continued wrapping things up) and he sat down to talk to me. which honest to god made things worse... i was fine sitting on the phone listening to my boyfriend's voice but then my brother started joking about the situation and then for some stupid reason talking about the hardship in my families lives.... and by then i am absolutely stuck to the ground and cant say anything. i love my brother but i cannot stand him 90% of the time and there he was - with his tiny chicken feet and big head - giving me his 2 cents about my living situation. we had to wait a while for my mom to finish. by the time i climbed in the car and we drive away i was at my ""peak"". it felt a lot like the part in dr. strange when he's tumbling through all the dimensions and floats helplessly. i lost track of time and i couldn't really feel anything, but i kept focusing on 3 names - my boyfriend's and my daughters names. i also kept apologizing to my poor mom who was scared shitless. by the time we got home (live about 1 1/2 from my job) i was still loopey but not as bad. 
this is probably the only part i liked about the situation. my dog came and knew i wasn't well so she kept licking my hands and my youngest daughter lay down next to me. it felt a lot like a dream at this point. my daughter had warm hands and was playing some funny videos on youtube and my dogs fur was so soft, she just stretched out along my back. i thought to myself if i'm stuck like this its fine - don't need anything else but my kiddies and my dog and just for this to be a never-ending loop of comfort. my mom made me a sandwich which i could hardly eat. finally 2 hrs later i was exhausted but back in my senses and i cried. no ugly crying but just a defeated whimper because i'm an idiot who's appetite got the better of me.
and we did find out that the chocolate belonged to one of the new tenants, apparently while i waited in the laundry room for them to leave they put it in the fridge. they called my mom twice when we were on our way home and they suggested she take me to the hospital... but i was fine and despite everything i felt i didn't do anything crazy... and no one at work will speak of this again because they know its a fuck up on their part as well.

so what could it have been?  it lasted for about 6hrs. everyone has been giving me different guesses.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: happened like ten years ago, of course, but i came to think of it today.

a friend of mine who lives in a more rural area came over to see me. on the way he had decided since it was such a lovely summer's day that he would take off his shoes and walk bare foot. but in a big city that may give you problems, and he ended up with a splinter in his foot, tiny but deep and irritating.

so when he came to my place he complained about how he couldn't get it out. after i gave him the proper scolding about being an idiot walking barefoot on these streets i came up with a solution...

you see i had recently been in greece and heard that when they get a splinter in the foot, they warm up some olive oil and soak the foot in it and the splinter slowly comes back out. i ask him if we should try that and he agrees.

so i start to heat up some olive oil on the stove. the thing is, i didn't consider that water and oil have different boiling points, so i treat it like water, heating it up until i could just start seeing some small bubbles. 

for water, this'd give you rather hot but bareable water if you just let it cool for a minute or pour in a dash of cold water.

for oil, though, this would be several hundred degrees more, i think (science nerds help me out here). hot enough to deep fry stuff at least.

so i let it cool for a minute, then put the pot on the floor and tell my friend to go ahead and dip his foot into the almost boiling oil.

he looks at me with doubt in his eyes and goes: ""you sure about this?""

""yeah man, they do this all the time in greece!""

so he dips his foot in the boiling oil...

and immediately he pulls it out again and screams a curse! 

as he hobbles over to the sink to flush cool water on his foot, i realize that *maybe* this wasn't such a good idea...

i immediately call emergency services. the lady who answered asked what is the emergency, so i have to tell her that i just deep fried my friend's foot. there was a pause as she had to let it sink in, and then she instructed me in how to take care of it until the ambulance got there.

the first responders came to take a look at it. i gave them the whole story and while still being professional about it, they made it abundantly clear that they thought i was an idiot. however they said that since he had only dipped the surface of the front sole and also because we had cooled it off promptly, the damage wasn't too serious. they didn't need to take him to the burn ward, so they just did their thing to fix it up and told him he had to stay off the foot for a while.

amazingly, we're still friends, however he does not trust my medical advice anymore.

 

**update**

[i ran in to him today at the dentist's office](http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/382scl/going_to_get_a_wisdom_tooth_pulled_need_some/) by coincidence. was just thinking about him this morning with the foot fries story and then meetnhim tje same day... small world.

input: Text: so this actually happened a few hours ago. it was breaktime and me and my friends were playing basketball. this dude comes up to us (let's call him crazy ruski) and he starts acting like he's the boss. i'm new to the school and have been here for 9 months and i've never properly spoken to him, but loads of people have told me he's a massive dickhead. 

anyway, we're just passing a ball around, and crazy ruski comes up to me (note: i'm 1m 85, he must be around 1m67) and says: ""hey you, pass me that ball asshole!""
i ignore him, thinking that that was a bit weird seeing as i've never even talked to the dude. 
he keeps repeating that, and then, in an angry-ass russian accent says: ""next time you touch that ball, you pass it to me. i'm giving you a warning."" 

now at this point, both of my friends are passing each other the ball, and i haven't even touched the god damn thing. they pass it to each other, and the next thing i know crazy ruski goes ape-shit on my ass. in an autistic fit of rage, the guy starts punching me in the face and pushing me. i'm solidly built, so all his punches felt like mosquito bites. 

fast-forward to 20 seconds later and the dude is still throwing punches. i decide i've had enough of his shit, and roundhouse kick the motherfucker in the face. seeing as he had the corpulence of a twig, he gets knocked back and falls on the floor. the retard must've landed on his wrist somehow, and he starts crying about how his wrist hurts.

again, fast forward to 30 minutes later, crazy ruski is taken to the nurse and me to the principal's office. we have a 10 minute talk about why i shouldn't do that, and the end result is a 2 day in-school suspension for me and a 1 week out-of-school suspension for him.

input: Text: yesterday i ordered something at bestbuy.com, because i had a gift card. the total was slightly over the gift card amount so i paid the extra few bucks with debit. it said i could pick it up that day, so i went over on my lunch break. the not-so-friendly lady at customer service told me they didn't have anything for me, and i couldn't find my order confirmation email so i couldn't prove her wrong. i searched all afternoon for my confirmation email, with no luck. 
when i got home, i had the bright idea to check my bank and see if the debit transaction went through but there was no best buy charge, not even pending. so i dug the gift card out of the trash and called to see how much $ was left on it. it was still full. 
i'm not sure if i had a psychotic episode or daydream or what, but apparently i never ordered anything, or at least never completed the order. i'm just glad it wasn't garbage day, that gift card would have been long gone.

input: Text: as with most posts, this one happened about 3 years ago.

i was a senior in high school at the time, and a very active member in my high school drama club/musical production crew. as a fundraiser, we would often hold a talent show and basket raffle in october, which would pay for our musical and leave us with some extra funds for next year's budget. this time, i was asked to host the event. not a problem for me, i loved being on stage and public speaking was no difficult task either.

come the night of the raffle, i showed up an hour early to make sure nobody was screwing up everything we had set up, checked the audio, counted the baskets, and moved a few centerpieces for the tables. everything was looking perfect. tonight was gonna be a success!

now comes the fuck up.

as the talent show drew to a close, it was time to raffle off some baskets. i drew the first ticket, called out the number, and heard a very familiar voice. it was a long-time supporter of our club, i'll call him ""joe."" joe stood up and cheered. in response, i said, ""congrats to joe! everybody give him a hand!""

dead silence. a few hushed whispers. joe busts out laughing.

that's when i remembered. joe only has one hand.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: alright, this needs some context. so i am not really a valentines person. i don't see the point in buying flowers on that day or doing something extra special. that's just me. 

moving onto second context. my first fuck up is when this morning i texted my girlfriend hello. she replies and we exchange mornings and how are you's. she says happy valentines, i say it back. then she goes on to how i should have said it first, and ""that i better have brought her flowers"", this i reply to ""i'll get right on that with all that money i have"", because i am not really the richest of fellows. 

this argument goes on for a little bit, but she leaves to go have coffee with a friend so i don't hear from her for a bit. i go to lunch at my school and the friend she(we will call her amanda) went to coffee with hands me chocolate from my girlfriend. i am confused and i tell her she is mad at me for not buying her flowers because i am poor and had other plans with her(we were going to go to the aquarium and then go to this awesome restaurant downtown), amanda doesn't say much, or at least i didn't hear it well. this is important.

i also told my roommate who we will call james. he agreed with me in saying that she overreacted and that it isn't a really big deal. this is also important. 

later that day, i go over to my girlfriends so we can argue more, because that's what we do. she won't hear anything from me so i tell her that i told amanda that she was mad at me for not buying her flowers and amanda thinks that is stupid. i said that amanda said it because my girlfriend doesn't really like my roommate that much, he is kind of unreliable and doesn't always get things done, but my girlfriend trusts amanda, so i needed something to get her to understand that she was overreacting and that we could hopefully fix this mess. 

long story short, we did figure it out. yay. we go to dinner together and watch the sun go down along the coast. it was nice. i peed in a bottle while driving home for the first time, it was a good memory. we head back over to her place so that we can talk about stuff and just be with each other. in the meantime, my girlfriend has apparently been texting amanda and asking why she thought it was stupid. amanda didn't understand and followed suit, which is starting to unravel what i said. this leads to spiral and i try to defend myself but it's no use.

i'm single now.

so we were planning on leaving saturday morning but we were out drinking late friday night and decide to head down in the middle of the night which was the first fuck up. no one was really sober but my one friend decided he was gonna drive anyways. it is about a 3.5 hour trip so we were hoping to get there around 5am and sleep in then go out saturday evening. everything was going fine me and the other friend not driving continued to drink the whole way. not wanting to stop to pee every 20 minutes i decide to piss in a empty fast food cup in the back seat. now this is the major fuck up, instead of dumping the cup out towards the back of the car i tilted it forward and since we were on the highway going about 70mph the piss just blew right back in the car all over my face and in my mouth.  my friends are dying laughing at me and there was nothing to clean myself up with so i had to take off my tshirt and wipe up the piss.  it was another hour or so away from the campus so i had to wait to clean myself up properly.  not my finest moment, but later that weekend i had another tifu moment which will be for a later post

input: Text: this happened yesterday but i didn't have time to post. 

i'll start with a little background. 

me and my fiancée decide to take a trip to disney world for memorial day weekend. on the car ride there we start to have a little war to mess with each other. i start by calling her ""bae"" and her by counterattacking by telling me ""oh yeah daddy"". i hate being called ""daddy"" because it creeps me out and she hates when i call her ""bae"" because she say's it makes me sound like an idiot. she continues to call me that, so in retaliation i start to fart. the conversation that followed was this


her: eww you farted, you're so gross

me: babe that wasn't me

her: you're the only other one here!!! you fart monster. 


i kept doing it and never owning up to it. so yesterday comes around and i fart in the hotel (we ate taco bell the night before) and i do my typical mo of not owning up to it. this is where i messed up. i had trained her to believe anytime a fart smell was around, that it was me. 


later in the day we get to end of the line for space mountain. the disney cast member instructs her to go to spot 1 and myself spot 2 for the space mountain coaster. all of sudden she starts with a disgusted face. i ask her what's wrong. that's when the stench hit's in my mouth and goes up my nose. the kid in front of me farted while being about 5 inches in front of me. the whole time i am telling my fiancée that it wasn't me, she see's how sincere i am being but she see's the opportunity to win our little war by making a scene and making the girls behind us believe that i was the creator of the foul stench. i am there with fart in my mouth, girls behind me with their noses in their shirts and a smiling fiancée. i won the battle but she won the war.

well the time comes that the dentist had to pull out my last two baby molars. i told the dentist that my mom couldn't handle the laughing gas, so i just wanted a little bit. i was afraid that i was a lightweight too and i would get sick.

i was soooo wrong. apparently i'm as tolerant as a horse. about 5 minutes into the procedure, i almost threw up because of the pain. they didn't let me numb up enough and the laughing gas did absolutely freakin nothing. as soon as she started, i could feel everything. the cracking of my teeth pretty much shocked through my whole jaw. i was crying, almost gagging, and squirming around. i couldn't say anything because she was working inside my mouth. when it finally ends, there are tears pouring down my cheeks and i can't breathe. she just looks at me, then at my mom, and says ""i don't think she's a lightweight.""

i know, i have a bad dentist. my mom also decided that we needed to go grocery shopping afterwards. walked around walmart silently crying with my mouth full of gauze.

 

edit: nitrous isn't a pain medicine but it reduces the feeling of pain, you pretty much don't give a shit. the numbing shots worked everywhere but my gums. so my chin, tongue, and cheeks were numb, but my gums weren't. that's why it hurt so much.

some people might find it funny, but when i was walking around walmart, i kept drooling bloody spit, and my mouth was numb so i couldn't tell. i'm sure i looked like an almost-adult baby. drooling, crying, babbling.

fast forward to the night in question. i'm going out to the bars with my buddies and we had pregamed in the car prior to walking to the bar. on our way there the topic of shitting came up and i just had to show my friends this glorious shit i had witnessed. we all had a good laugh with some shock and awe thrown in. 

so we get to the bar and it was a little dead but we stuck around. towards the end of the night some of my friends stepped outside for a smoke so i joined them. i notice a girl standing by herself so i approached her and chatted for a little while. it was time to go, so i asked her for her number. i went to pull out my phone, and what was the first thing we both saw? a toilet with a fucking 10 inch log in it. i panicked as i saw her face go from smiling to wtf in an instant. i explained the situation but needless to say it did not end well.

earlier in the day, she told me that she didn't want to turn off the ceiling fan (full speed, this is texas) while we had fun together the first time. because of that, i didn't bother asking about the ceiling fan the second time. my girlfriend got on her hands and knees in the bed, and i got behind her, aware of the spinning blades in close proximity to my head. unfortunately, about 20 seconds into the deed, i realized that i needed to adjust my body slightly. i ignore the concept of situational awareness as i'm trying to adjust to the position of maximum pleasure and comfort. the next thing i hear is a loud whack, my head immediately begins throbbing, and dust starts to rain down onto the playing field. my girlfriend flips out and asks if i'm okay. i try to play it off because, sex (and embarrassment), but i'm definitely hurting. my girlfriend gets away from me and examines my head. the result is several bleeding scratches (bleeding has ceased), two bumps, and a lingering headache on the left side of my head.

and no, we didn't finish fun time.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: ok, this actually happened last december.

my 38 weeks pregnant wife asked me who i would fuck if i could fuck anyone in the world. without thinking i said ""mila kunis before she got pregnant"".  

immediate cringe, followed by a quiet ride home.  we now have a beautiful healthy 7 month old and my wife still gives me shit for this comment.

edit: i just want to clarify since some people seem to be missing the point.  it was the ""before she got pregnant"" part of my answer that was the fuck up.  simply saying ""mila kunis"" would have been fine.  my wife jokingly gives me shit about it.  i swear my wife is hotter post-pregnancy.
output: ",TIFU by being honest with my pregnant wife

input: Text: this literally just happened, but heres some backstory


so i broke up with my ex today, it was bad. real bad. we had been together for 13 months, and a series of shitty things made today happen. i've been taking it super badly, she was one of those girls where you're just like ""theres no fucking way i'm actually fucking this girl right meow."" so anyways, we got in a fight today, she was yelling, i was yelling, the cat was scared shitless. so ya know i left to go kick it and hit some bowls with a buddy, take my mind off it as much as i can

my bud said, hey man go on *tinder* and bang something tonight. well, i swiped and swiped and swiped some more. i had a few matches (i'm honestly not bad looking, not to brag just for context) within a couple hours. i had been talking to this damn cute girl, small, cute green/blue eyes, and one of them short cuts, i like it.

so we're talking and talking, i eventually ask her for her number. we keep talking and we both just start getting more into it with the flirting, we're basically fucking over a text message at this point. i was gonna take off from my homies to go meet her and in one of those ""wow i'm fucking stoned and just blew it"" moments, i had sent a text saying ""i'm on my way to you my horny ass short haired fuck bag"" to my ex, instead of tinder girl. 

she has yet to respond

i am on my way to the bag now!
output: ","tifu by calling my ex a ""horny ass short haired fuck bag"""

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so a year ago i went to get the doctor because i found a lump on my breast, it wasn't too big but it was there. took some tests, turns out it was nothing but i had to get checked again in a few months. in april i went to get checked again and the lump was relatively the same size and the tests came back normal again but i had to get it checked again in a few months. so earlier this month i went to the doctor and she seemed alarmed. the lump had doubled in size and she noticed discharge coming from my breast. she says i have to get more tests done than usual. so i start freaking out because i believe i may have breast cancer. i tell my mother and she freaks as does my dad, so i decide not to tell anyone else. the thing is that if you think you may be dying the thoughts start to eat you alive and that's pretty much all i could think of. anyway, during this passed year, my friend(m) has had a bad breakup and a miscarriage as well as a new pregnancy where she had told virtually no one but me. i had been there for her the entire time, and tried my best to make her feel better. she vented to me and i lent her a shoulder to cry on because she didn't deserve any of that heartache plus she got dumped i didn't want her to go through everything alone, no one deserves that. so around 2 weeks ago i decide that since she confided in me all her problems she will probably help me relax and just reassure me that i'm going to be okay and that i am worrying for no reason. so i ended up telling (m) that i may have breast cancer and that i already had some tests taken but need to get more done and that i'm scared shitless. she tells me that my situation sucks and then doesn't respond. i messaged her the next day and i didn't get a reply. i thought perhaps she was just busy. i have texted her and snapchatted her...all she does is just look at them and not reply. i was already terrified of some of the tests i still had to do and of course about my results but now the only person i confided in doesn't respond to me or even acknowledge me and that hurt because here i may be dying and she doesn't even try to talk to me. if she didn't know how to comfort me, that's fine we could act like nothing is going on but i just got ghosted. i got my results on friday, i don't have cancer but i think i did lose a friend.
output: ",TIFU by telling my friend I may have cancer.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so yesterday morning i finished a my 14th straight nightshift. it must be said this is not part of my normal work pattern, and im feeling extremely tired, as i always wake up at midday, and not start my shift till 6pm. this longer than usual roster has given my body clock hell, and i have been a walking zombie for several days now. 

in an effort to reduce this i forced myself to say awake till about 9am, crusing reddit, youtube etc, to allow myself to sleep later in the afternoon, and hopefully give my body clock a chance at a semi normal amount of sleep. when i do allow myself to sleep, its glorious, i dont stir at all during the day. most unusual, as i am a light sleeper. 

when i wake, im feeling, for lack of a better word, hungover. groggy, puffy face, dazed and confused as to whats going on. i roll over and check the time on my phone, its 5:10pm. my shift starts at 6pm, and work is 30min drive away. fuck.

unfortunately in my extremely fatigued state, i neglected to set an alarm to wake myself. i have 20 minutes to get myself ready and on the road. not an impossible feat usually, but at this particular moment, i could barely remember which way was up. 

i head to the bathroom, hoping a quick shower will bring me back to the land of the living. grab my toothbrush and stick some toothpaste on it, the fancy whitening kind, that gets all bubbly. heading for the shower, my docile brain says, 'you need to poop'. no problem, probably best to do this before a shower. 

i sit on the toilet, and in a ill conceived effort to hurry up my routine, begin brushing my teeth while i poop. 

now at some stage of this poorly planned exercise of hygienic dysfunction, ive managed to dribble a wad of spit & toothpaste onto my leg. with nothing else nearer to clean it with, and neglecting to even consider that i am about to shower anyway, i reach for some paper to clean it up. 

as plainly obvious by now, i am in no mind set to make decisions. my brain is working on autopilot and muscle memory. so as i wipe my toothpaste off my thigh, the hand gets a mind of its own. down my hand goes, to dispose of this newly tooth pasted tissue of minty doom, and for some reason unknown to anyone living or dead, it wipes my asshole. 

almost immediately the burning started. i'm not sure of anyone else has toothpasted their asshole before, but this much is clear, its not to be done.

a mixture of warm, and cold, and stinging and sphincter clenching, and cursing follows. feverishly wiping my ass to try and mitigate the damage, i give up and head for the shower. i spend the next 10 minutes scrubbing my violated date with every available cream, lotion, shampoo and soap. protip here: dove seemed to work the best! 

eventually the pain subsides, however im well and truly behind schedule at this stage. i am, however wide awake!
