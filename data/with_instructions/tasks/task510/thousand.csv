Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this was about 10 years ago.

i worked as break relief in a bread factory. a ""wonderful"" bread factory, that at the time produced 3400-4000 loaves of bread per hour, and on a separate line 1800-3200 units of rolls (hamburg buns etc.) per hour. i was tasked with the job of relieving people for their breaks which were 20 minutes in length. 

there was this one job as a mixer operator. basically the job entails running a huge mixing machine, and the volume it could contain was measured in the thousands of gallons. typically, it would produce about 500 kg of dough every 15 minutes. visualize a 10 foot tall horseshoe-shaped bowl rotated vertically that is rotated down to empty and you get the idea.

so, to make dough, you have 4 basic ingredients: flour, water, yeast, and at this place, vegetable oil.

when i went to relieve the guy working this job, there has just been a change in the formula. to change the formula, you enter the new amounts of water, flour etc. on a keypad, and then press ""submit"" to save the changes.

what i hadn't noticed until it was too late was that the previous operator had forgotten to press ""submit"" on the amount of yeast for the new formula. so, what happened was i pressed the button to discharge flour, water, oil, and then yeast into the mixture, and then immediately noticed that the volume of yeast indicated on the panel was flashing, indicating that the previous operator did not press submit, and without intervention the machine will discharge only the amount that was in the previous formula. 

to correct this, for the first time ever, i pressed the big red stop button beside the control panel for yeast, inputted the correct amount less than the amount already discharged, and pressed the discharge button again. satisfied that i believe what i did was the right thing, i started the mix cycle, walked away and did something else.

15 minutes later, i'm relieving a different guy, but i have line of sight to the mixing machine. at the end of the cycle, the operator i relieved previously started to rotate the bowl, and not even after 10 degrees of rotation did a few dozen gallons of liquid yeast pour out. the mixing machine was completely full of yeast!

what had happened was, for some asinine reason, the ""stop"" button also reboots the plcs controlling the valve . i acted so quickly in inputting new numbers that the plc hadn't rebooted before i had hit the submit button. meaning, the valve was now stuck open. why they hadn't coded for that i'll never know.

in total, thousands of gallons of yeast were discharged into this mixing machine without anybody knowing for 15 minutes. as normally the amount used per run would be measured in the single digits of gallons, the facility only kept enough yeast to last about 3 days of normal production. this ""glitch"" ha actually depleted every last bit of yeast stored at the facility. they had to have a truck sent from a facility about 8 hours away to resupply, causing about 10 hours of downtime.

did i get fired? almost! they did try to scapegoat me saying i didn't follow proper procedure etc. but, the union came to my rescue and allowed me to keep my job. apparently this little bit of information was placed in the maintenance manuals, which are never provided to the operators for training.

input: Text: actually a couple months ago. forgot about it until now. i was on my school trip to dc, it was my first time going there so i was pumped. we went to see all of the main touristy attractions (this is day one) then lastly we go on this big yacht. it is pretty popular but i do not remember the name off of the top of my head. at this point i haven't slept for maybe 48 hours, as i can't sleep in vehicles and it is about an 8 hour ride down. i was sitting with my friend and looking out into the river, on the back of the boat. i lean over the railing and look down. my glasses decide to slide off my face. *shit what do i do now?* i text my mom to tell her my new glasses just fell through the propeller of a huge boat and are now chilling in the potomac. this was only at the start of the ride and i couldn't see at all for the rest of the time. remember this is only day one out of two. i missed on seeing about half of the stuff, including arlington, the lincoln, korean, and vietnam memorials.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: okay so giving the background to this story-
i'm a girl and my friends and i had been invited to come over to a house full of hot guys to chill. so naturally we go, and there's one hot guy i talk to the most, and we click and talk more and play beer pong. 
so we both get super drunk and we ended up in someone's bedroom where we proceeded to make out and take off each other's clothes. this next park might be tmi and you might get grossed out but it was literally the most embarrassed i've ever been with a guy.
so things escalate and he starts doing me, and then we switch positions and i start to give him a bj.
here's the bad part.
my stomach started to hurt from all the cheap burnettes mixed with cheap beer and after i gagged once there was no going back.
i threw up all over his junk. literally all over.
but here's the best part: he kept going.
he must've really wanted to fucking finish because we switched positions while there's vomit all over the bed and still on his dick.
needless to say i threw up again, and when he finally finished we kind of sobered up and realized there was fucking throw up all over us.
i apologized like a million times but he was a trooper and actually hugged me.
now we're friends on instagram. i'm still confused 

.

update: question to all guys out there: if this happened to you would you keep going, stop and be grossed out, stop but be understanding, or what? because for me in this situation i literally felt awful haha and i want to know if guys would think of this as a big deal??

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: several years ago, before i was in my current relationship, i was that douchebag guy. i would have different women come and go. well one day i had two different women, let's call them **hannah** and **alice**, that wanted to come over and see me, one of which, **hannah**, i liked a lot. well normally i wouldn't have two girls over in the same day, to prevent any of the *seeing* and *meeting* each other, but i was full of myself. i told **alice** to come over early that morning so we could spend most of the morning together, but i had to go in to work early that afternoon.  i told **hannah** that i was working all morning but to come over later that afternoon and she could stay the night. 

well **alice** shows up around 7am, and of course, we screw around all morning. well **dumbass** me falls asleep, without setting an alarm. **alice** is asleep now too, thinking i'll wake her up when i have to go to work. well not *only* did **hannah** show up earlier than expected, she walks into my apartment without knocking, something she's does from time to time. i'm telling you, we really liked each other and had been talking for a while. *i just happened to like all the pussy too*. well what happens is this. i hear the truck, i *look* at the clock, and see it's a little passed noon. well **fuck fuck fuck**. i'm getting hot, nervous, my heart is sinking, i know i'm caught. maybe i can rush **alice** out the door before **hannah** can get put of her truck, *maybe* **hannah** will take her time coming inside. i wake **alice** up, say, ""*shit babe, i overslept, we've gotta go!* well **fuck me again**, she's butt ass naked and taking her *fucking* time getting her clothes on. **i am panicking**, and that's that. i'm freaking, and **alice** can tell. she thinks it is because i'm *late*, how cute. then i hear it, someone walking down the stairs outside my apartment. *my apartment was below the parking lot.* **hannah** walks in. a portal to hell opens, and shit goes crazy! if you want to know how to open a portal to hell, have two women you're fucking, meet. they both ask ""*who is this?*"" i'm not even speaking, my brain has shut down, i remember they are both screaming now, they'll start at me, and then they'll go  at each other. **hannah** starting to cry out of rage. this lasts for at least **10 minutes**, but to me it feels like forever. i want to lay down and die. **alice** finally just says *fuck you* to *me*  and starts to leave,  **hannah** says something along the lines of, ""*oh you didn't get enough?*"". i shit you not, **alice**, holding onto the front door, turns, looks at **hannah** and says, ""*no, i got plenty, i was just warming him up for you.*"", and leaves from my apartment and my life. **hannah**, still standing there in shock and tears, wants me to explain, wants some kind of explanation. well reddit, i'm fried, my brain has completely overloaded, i can't even speak. i'm just standing there like a fucking mental patient with the dumbest look on my face i'm sure. after what seems like forever, she finally just leaves.

**hannah** and i spoke a little after that from time to time. i still couldn't think of anything to say to make anything right. what was i suppose to say? i can't even think of anything smartass to say.  to this day, that was my biggest fuck up ever.

input: Text: this actually happened about a year and a half ago. my best friend and i im each other almost every day (we don't live near each other). this has been going on for about 10 years at the time, so, yanno, we're comfortable with each other. we make lots of really bad, off color jokes, all the time. he's also gotten me really good on multiple april fool's, so, yanno, sometimes i take what he says with a big grain of salt.

now, all i know at this point is that my friend, let's call him tim, is super clumsy. that's cool, i'm pretty clumsy myself, but he just seems to have a knack for getting into awful situations and mildly hurting himself. so i lovingly refer to his mishaps as ""timming"", and we kek mightily over this for years. it becomes one of our biggest inside jokes, to refer to accident prone people as ""tims"", or the act of being in one of these accidents as ""timming"". (i'd like to stress here that we'd never make fun of people in serious accidents. we're talking about small cuts, bruises, scrapes, that kind of thing.)

anyway, on this fateful day, he winds up tripping and falling and mildly hurting himself as he usually does. i worry over him of course, because i'm a good friend dammit, and whip out with ""why do you tim yourself so much?!"" i've asked similar things over the years and expect a good-natured ""i dunno"" or the usual off hand joke, but instead he tells me, ""because i have cerebral palsy.""

again, this dude and i, we've been chatting with each other for 10 years. i've stayed with him and his family and had a rockin' good time. we make horrible jokes all the time. this isn't even the most horrible of all of them, so i cackle and tell him that isn't a nice thing to say. ""muffinbutton, i'm serious."" ""lol kay."" (to be fair and to make me look like less of the asshole i'm quickly shaping up to sound like, he put a smiley face at the end of his sentence. how was i supposed to know he was being serious when he uses emoticons?!)

""muffinbutton, i have a mild case of cerebral palsy. there were complications when i was born. i had years of therapy to learn to walk right. i'm very lucky, but i still walk with a limp and don't have the best motor skills. that's why i fall over a lot and hurt myself.""

oops! i'll just be over here at the shovel store, buying a bigger shovel so i can dig the hole i've dug myself just a bit deeper!

the incident didn't change our relationship at all, and he admitted that me coming up with the whole ""timming"" thing made him feel a lot better about things but wow i felt like an asshole that day. i'm just happy to have such a good friend that didn't immediately block my stupid ass and has a great sense of humor.

input: Text: ah, there's a first for everything, including smoking. here's how my first smoke went:

it was a cold november evening at a house party and i was very drunk. i see a girl smoking outside and start a drunken conversation with her. we got onto the topic of smoking and she offers me a puff of her cigarette. me being inexperienced at that sort of thing politely took the cigarette and pretended to inhale. drunk people aren't great at being subtle and she saw right through my act and lightly teased me for it. 

so, i decided to take in the biggest puff my lungs could hold. i had vaped clouds before, how different could it be?

the answer was, very fucking different. the shock of all that smoke going down into my virgin alveoli immediately produced a reaction in the form of violent coughing and me dropping the cigarette inside the wooden decking of the garden, losing the cigarette. ah fuck, i had made a complete jackass of myself in front of this girl *and* lost her cigarette. oh well, time to go to back into the house.

5 minutes later i walk back outside and nearly shat myself. the cigarette i had dropped had turned from a tiny clump of embers into a plume of smoke and flame coming out between the holes of my friend's decking. shit. fuck. within a few minutes the whole deck would be on fire then my friend's house would be ground-zero within hours.

thank god for garden hoses and sober friends i guess, the next few minutes was a blur of water jugs and hosesprays all around the garden

input: Text: this is currently happening as i am typing this. 

every friday at our school we don't have classes and instead of classes we have year long projects. my friends and i decided to do some studies by using blue crabs and testing them in different environments. so today my friend walked in with a white 5 gallon bucket of baby blue crabs, there were probably 4 or 5 in the bucket. i was in charge of watching the crabs and staying with the bucket. this is all happening at lunch time and as the clock winds down i haven't gone to get my lunch yet. i am pretty hungry and had an extremely small breakfast. so i decide to place the bucket in the corner of the room and go and get lunch. 

i had a great lunch. the pizza that i had was fantastic so a+ lunch. as i return the 5 gallon bucket is gone from where i put it. i immediately go into panic mode and start running all over the school to find it. with the bucket no where to be found i rush to the front office and ask if they have seen it anywhere? they say they haven't. we then as a team of group and front office staff run around the school to find the crabs. again no luck. we then used the intercom which has only been used 2 other times in the existence of the school. once for a flood and once for a medical emergency. ""a group has lost a  gallon bucket of crabs if anyone has taken it or sees it pleas bring it to the front office. 

 


edit: here is the update no news from the thief. also haven't found them we are going in to school today on a saturday to tear the school apart to look for them. our school has a knack of putting things in the ceiling so this is the first place we are going to check. 


edit2: after yesterday's search we believe that a group of freshman took them.

input: Text: all right, so this just happened to me and i am so embarrassed. today's my birthday and my girlfriend and i were supposed to go out, but she had to pick up an extra shift at work, so we both decided to celebrate my birthday tomorrow. it was a boring night and i had nothing to do but stream netflix, so what's the next best thing? i decided to watch some porn to pass by time before i sleep. my roommate is gone for the weekend, so i was able to masturbate freely. as i was getting into it, i hear the front door open. i heard the voice of my roommate echoing through the walls. i was sure he heard my sexual moans. instead of stopping, i decided to continue masturbating making all these sounds. my girlfriend and i have sex all the time in my room, but my roommate doesn't seem to care too much, so i decided to let my roommate believe i was with my girlfriend. it's better than masturbating, right? all of a sudden, i heard a door slam. i dismissed it and continued to masturbate. 10 minutes later, i received a text from my girlfriend.
                                  
**girlfriend:** it's over

**me:** what?

**girlfriend:** i can't believe you...i was going to surprise you. i never want to see you again.

 5 minutes later, my roommate texted me...

**roommate:** that's messed up, man.

**me:** what did i do?

**roommate:** you had another girl in your room.

that's when i realized that my roommate and girlfriend thought that i was with another girl in my room. she's not responding to my texts.

 

**update:** wow, today is just not my day. it's also friday the 13th. i got a text back from her telling me that it was okay that i cheated on her because she also had a moment of weakness a month ago when she cheated on it. i don't know how to take this right now.

**update #2:** she cheated on me with my roommate. supposedly they were heading back to my place together to fuck. i told my roommate that i would be out with another friend celebrating my birthday for the night, so it looks like my roommate and girlfriend took the opportunity to fuck while i was gone. little did they know that i decided to stay home.

the reason it hurt my dad's feelings is because when i was a baby my mother left my dad one day while he was at work. she wrote a letter that explained how she was unhappy in their marriage and that she was taking my sister and i with her and moving ""home.""  my mother's home is the tiny island in the south pacific called guam.  my dad lived in colorado.  i did not meet my father until i was around 11 years old.  it wasn't my father's fault he wasn't there when i was growing up.  

a few years later while my dad and i were hunting, he had told me that i hurt his feelings that day and he hadn't forgotten. he knew i had not done it on purpose but it reminded him of all the time he missed out while my sister and i were growing up.

input: Text: not only did this happen today, i am 10 minutes beyond this experience as i write.

  let me start off by saying i get filthy at work. my skin is usually fifty shades of gray. 

   i get frustrated at work a lot. i come home stressed, and usually just want to sit on the porch and browse reddit for hours. there comes a time when my lazy ass finally says, ""ok, this is the last link i click"", and i head inside.
   so after my routine reddit sesh, i find myself in the shower. hot water feeling great, excited to get the filth off.  i can't stop thinking about what i'm going to have for dinner. things are just right with the earth. 
  i grab my bottle of axe body wash and my axe scrubber thingy, and i start to squeeze some jelly out of it.  i'm a little low. i gotta shake it a bit.
  fueled by the rage of the day, and the thought of not smelling like a black ice, i give it one last vicious shake (those real snappy shakes to get your money's worth) while letting out an affirmitive, ""oh, you fucking cunt!""
  i made sure to time the ""cunt!"" perfectly with the apex of my final, most ferocious shake to make sure all my rage was focused on getting those last drops of goo. 
   well, instead, i lost my grip of the oddly shaped bottle and flung it, full speed, directly into one of my testicles. i also then dropped the scrubby thingy, losing what remaining goo i managed to scavenge in the first place.
   i took a few seconds to gather myself. i then began to lather myself with shampoo. i was out of options.

so this happened about a week ago(insert song here). in my university, they had a welcome day. it was tempting to stay home but i decided to go to it.

now here the fuck up. 
under the chairs, they placed cards(you know like the one's to win a prize), so me unknowingly sat on one of those chairs. 

the card had a symbol that was unknown until later on. my mind was telling me to give it to a girl from my class but my mind said no.

later on, they said those with that card had to dance. my mind was fucked up. my heart started beating. so i walked up and had to chose a dance to dance to. i drawed it and it was...... watch me whip(or whatever the hell that dance is called).

so when it was my turn, i was one if the few people who didn't know how to dance to it. i was forced to do it as i couldn't drop out. while this was going in, the back of my neck was paining like *insert vulgar word here"" hell.

afterwards, the embarrassment screwed me over. i felt like crap. my mind was uneasy. after all this bs, they then said it was able to view on the school's website.

few days went by and i completely forgot about it then my cousin tagged me in the video. now my family will know about the fuck up.

last night i got shitfaced.  i bowl on thursdays, and my buddies and i usually enjoy a few beers, but i guess i felt like letting loose a little bit, and we were also getting some free drinks and shots from the wait staff. also, i had a designated driver, so everything fell into place to have a blast. 
i was shitfaced at that level where you can't really see anything, and what you can see looks like the milenium falcon jumping into hyperdrive, while also spinning in a circle. good times. 

i got home and stumbled into bed. the world was spinning, i was doing everything i could to avoid having to throw up. i know some people would rather puke and feel better, but i just have an aversion to it and avoid it at all costs. plus i didn't want to wake my wife up. 

fast forward to today. i of course woke up with a pretty nasty headache and some residual nausea, but i'm a grown up so a dragged myself out of bed and got to work on time. i was playing it safe. had a few bites of toast. alternated sipping water and gatorade, just trying to get things back to normal. i thought i had it under control.  

at 9 i had a meeting with my boss and a couple of other fellows, discussing a pretty exciting opportunity that's coming my way which includes a promotion and a pretty significant raise. my boss was sitting at the head of a rounded off conference table. i was sitting next to him on one side, so we were in fairly close proximity.  at some point, it started to hit me that i was not ok, and the hangover was making a strong comeback. i felt sick.  i tried to power through and pay attention, and i just kept hoping this meeting would be over soon, because i was pretty sure i was going to have to hurl this poison out of me.  finally, my boss asked me a direct question.  i turned to face him, and i opened my mouth to answer....and out of me erupted a wet death with the force of a fire hose. it was exactly like something out of a movie. it looked fake as it happened, when i see it in my memories, it still looks fake. i absolutely destroyed the man who is in direct control of my financial future. 

he left work to change and clean up. 4 hours ago. i still haven't heard from him.

input: Text: yea well, happened like 2 minutes ago.

im at my archery shooting range right now to do some training, since its one of those days its not raining, weird. so when i arrived i first made my way to the bushes next to the range to have a wee pee. there was this huge plant of nettles in front of me so by male instinct i had to pee on the leafs. very soon i would regret, because in a very fast pace the whole spawn of satan bend over right to my..yes. it rested his itchy leaf on my best parts. because i was in the middle of the act i could not just do a backflip or something, took me by surprise. 

so now my pantsnake is itching and i dont even know how im supposed to hold a steady bow, i hope it wears off soon. never even thought something like this could happen. it looks and feels like i caught a nasty std.

input: Text: i posted this 2 days ago but i didn't know about the no poop stories on weekdays thing. so here it goes again:

after a party today i was heading off home and just missed my train. no worries i'll just go to kfc to pass time.
i go up and order my zinger burger meal then sit down and start eating it. i'm looking at my phone and eating at the same time, once i finished i discover some bastard has left his twister, wrapped and all.


i give it a poke. hmm seems fine, just cold. seems like it was from around an hour ago. being the frugal, greedy fat cunt i am, i wait until the person next to me leaves and i go ahead and eat the twister. all i can say is, it was delicious at the time.


now i'm at the train station. that's when the immense stomach aches begin. but you know what i'm a tough guy and ain't letting no pussy ass aches stop me. the train comes and i get onto the train with no problems and the ache goes away.


then... 4 stops before home. my phone is about is dead and i'm reading the local newspaper which i found on the train.
boom. my ache is back. fuckkkk its so bad this time. my ass hole begins to let air out once every second to ease the ache.
3 stops from home.


gg there's no more air left in my bowels and i can feel poop edging out of my butt. the uneasiness is fucking unreal. i grab a few pages of the newspaper and shape it quickly into a nappy and stuff it in my underpants..


im pacing down the hallways now to stop my sphincter from failing me. the people on the other carriages can see me with my but clenched walking up and down the aisle.
1 stop from home.


holy fuck. you know how the closer you get to the toilet the looser your anus becomes. fuck me at this point i feel like a 60 year old slut who loves it up in hole #2. there has got to be a bit of poop in my hand made newspaper nappy.


this has got to be the greatest mental and physical challenge of my life. my whole body and mind is failing me at this point. but you know what i can do this,!!!


i clench my sphincter like i'm doing my last rep in my last set. it's the finale boys. you will be free soon mr brown.
the doors open to my train stop and bolt to the toilet. and fuck me am i a dumb cunt. it's fucking 2am of course the toilets locked.


but my anal muscles cannot handle the weight of my poop. i am this choice have no choice but to empty my bowels onto the grass right outside the station. it is the biggest shit i've ever taken and looks like 3kg of satay sauce from the local thai restaurant.
i cleaned my ass hole with the leftover newspaper and covered the poop with it and ran home where i'm currently recovering safely.


sorry to whoever is greeted by a giant pile of shit tomorrow morning at the station. i promise this will never happen again

** 

edit: i should mention i live in australia!!!

edit 2: just went back to the same station. can confirm the poop is still there, albeit dried up. looks like a circular piece of meatloaf now. it smells like total shit,  no one has cleaned it up and there are flies buzzing around.

input: Text: so this tifu did not happen today, although i just found about this subreddit from my brother when i told him this story. this happened two days ago.  
   
   so i walked into work this morning, and i was about 15 minutes early, so i decided to chill in the break room for a few minutes. as i sit down at a table in the break room, i spot the vending machine. what are the odds! i have a five dollar bill in my pocket! but the vending machine wont accept a five dollar bill for a one dollar beverage. i decide to hurry to another break room in another section of the hangar. (i work at an airport.) i go to the other break room which has a money changing machine. i skip to the machine and insert my five dollar bill. now, i was expecting to get five ones or even a few quarters. i was not expecting what happened next. the machine beeped, and then started spewing nickels. nickels! fucking nickels!!!!! 5 dollars in nickels is 100 nickels! i stood there, frozen, in front of a crowded break room. it was completely quiet, (except all those fucking nickels rolling around), and everyone was staring at me. i kinda just stood there for a few seconds, thinking it was a joke. but it wasn't. i quickly got down and grabbed all the nickels, shoving them into my pockets. everyone began to laugh. i ran out of the room, leaving a trail of nickels.  i walked around work clinking and jingling for the rest of the day. but i decide i already sacrificed so much for this gatorade, i will get this damn thing. so i stood in front of the machine putting nickel after nickel in. it takes forever but i do it. as im leaving work, i have to go through security. i beep and the security guard asks me to hold out my arms. i try to tell the man i have some loose change, but he just goes ""ok sonny but ima going to need you to hold out your arms."" (i live in the southern u.s.) he waves his wand around, gets to my hips and the wand beeps. he asks me to empty my pockets.  i start pulling out handfuls of nickels. the security people dont believe this, but i tell them what happened and they all started laughing. they said i could go through. so yes. that happened. it was one of the most embrassing moments of my life.

input: Text: not today but...

two weeks ago i went to a 3 day festival, a regional burning man event. fast forward to the day after the festy i went to a party at a friend's house and got extremely drunk. as soon as i came home, i passed out. 

i woke up a few hours later with the  very strong urge to take a piss. when i woke up, i woke up in a half-dream state and i thought i was still camping and i was in the tent. it was dark as fuck in my room. in my half-asleep and possibly still drunk haze, i then got out of bed, and started feeling around for the tent flaps. i eventually found the ""tent flaps"" but then tried to feel around for open space so i can find a nice spot to release my urine. couldn't find it, but i thought ""well, i'm outside of the tent, i'll just piss directly out of it."" and i started taking a leak. 

about 3 seconds into my stream, i then came to my senses. ""wait, i'm no longer at the festival. i'm at home... and in my closet"" and then stopped pissing and then found the restroom. my closet floor was pretty wet but i didn't fuck it up as bad as i thought.

it was embarrassing as fuck even though i'm the only one that knows about it, and now internet strangers do too.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: first, a little context for the story.  i am a 22 year old male and i just finished working that [pennsylvania farm show](http://www.farmshow.state.pa.us/), with 14-hour-days on my feet, 9 days straight.  i won’t mention exactly what my job was because it would be obvious who i was irl, but it involved making food and picking up heavy things fairly regularly.  

now, on to the fuck up.  due to the strenuous nature of my job, i had developed a sore, knotty back, so i decided that a nice long soak in the tub would probably do wonders for me.  i hadn’t taken a bath in probably 8 years, i just prefer showers.  so i get all set up; the perfect temperature, epsom salts, bubble bath, a nice bowl of weed… the whole nine yards.  anyways, as i’m sitting there, i need to reach out of the tub to grab the shampoo.  at this point, i was pretty high.  i reach forward at kind of an odd angle, and suddenly feel water shoot up my ass, catching me totally by surprise.  after the initial shock wears off, i think, “huh, i can probably clean my butthole like that”.  did i mention that i was high?

so i start shifting back and forth and, at first, it is working/feeling kinda good.  i guess i must have moved too forcefully, because all of a sudden, i shit myself.  i am so caught off-guard that i drop my bowl right into the tub.  so now have shit on me, shit floating in the bathwater, and my weed is gone.
  
i open the drain, turn the shower on and rinse myself off.  once the tub is empty, i see there is still some left in the tub, so i now have to clean that shit up.

input: Text: original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3o60y2/tifu_by_telling_my_girlfriend_that_i_masturbate/

*originally i posted this on tuesday but those darn mods wouldn't let me. it's fine now.*

okay, so like i said i went into school today and at lunch went to the library. she wasn't there this time around, so i went to the cafeteria.

now, i had gotten strange looks and some laughs earlier in the day, so i knew she had spread the word with my mastery to masturbate. 

when i went into the cafeteria, i saw her with her friends, so i decided to sit alone at the table across from her. i had no lunch as usual, so i simply stared at her for, say, thirty seconds before realizing i was being cringy so i went up and sat as close to her as possible.

immediately, her friends either giggled or called me nasty and told me to sit away from them, so i acted. i read every single comment, and i chose was i thought would be the most flattering and best plan by combining a couple of suggestions.

in front of all her friends, i said something like this:

""gf, i'm sincerely sorry for disgusting you. however, i want you to know that the very reason i chose to jack off to you was because i cared about you.""

i obviously wasn't that eloquent, but she was blushing, so i thought i was doing well.

""over all the naked women on the internet, i chose your body to lust to. i had hoped you'd think it's flattering.""

i was wrong about how i was doing.

""don't talk to me anymore"", said gf.

i was desperate, so i used what i learned from nofap.

""gf, i haven't jacked off to you in nearly a month. please, i do not jack off anymore. not in 25 days."" she ignored me.

i left, in defeat and shame. 

we're officially broken up and i'm now known as the fapmaster around school.

*edit* i'm fapmaster flash now. a lot of things happened since tuesday. this isn't the right sub for the story, though.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: background info: when i was around 5 years old, i had a rat named bob and he lived in one of those little glass aquarium/cages.  there is only one  bathroom that i could use back then (the other is attached to my parents room).  i also had no concept of how much small animals peed. 

one day my parents were having a party, and they said they weren't going to force me to mingle with their friends.  during the party i was hiding in my room when i realized i really had to pee, but i didn't want to make it known that i was home by going to the bathroom.  i ended up holding my pee for far too long and finally made a run for it, but there was someone in there.  whoever was in the bathroom must have been having some problems because they were there for a really long time.  meanwhile my bladder was about to burst, so i ran back into my room frantic, saw the glass aquarium and let loose.  bob immediately sought out shelter on top of his little house while his aquarium filled with over an inch of pee.  

after i peed in his cage i panicked, but then realized i had a perfect scapegoat... the rat.  i gathered up my courage, ran upstairs and told my mom that bob had an accident in his cage.  she was confused but came down to my room, along with a bunch of her friends.  as soon as everyone walked in and saw bob swimming around in an inch of pee i confidently said ""i think bob peed"".  everyone was able to come to the conclusion that that i was the one who peed in the aquarium and burst out laughing, i was absolutely mortified at the time.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i was walking home after work and, with it being friday, had planned to stop by the shop and grab myself a few drinks for the festivities later on. i waited in line at the cash machine to collect the rewards of my hard graft that week, or rather what was left of it after rent and bills had been stripped away. 

i don't know if it's common in other countries, but we would have some homeless people who would sit beside the cash machine and relentlessly beg ""change please"" at any one using the machine. i don't have a single coin on my being to buy their silence, and i'm lifting cash from the machine... i suspect it might be their game plan, but there is no way i'm passing on notes. so i stare blankly ahead, trying my best to put on my 'i've-had-a-tough-day' face on and faking deafness or letting on i'm zoned out, i'm never sure which. i get my money and go. i'm a bastard.

about 200 yards further along on my journey to home, i call into the garage. outside is a scruffy looking character squatting outside the window. the beggars don't usually come down these parts, but this one had the instrument that really tugs my heart strings. a dog. a dog, possibly some sort of terrier but i'm no dog expert, lying sprawled out in front of him. like the chaps lingering at the cash machine, i was aware of this guys plan (the dog) but this time, it was going to work. not only that, but this time i'd be coming out of the shop with change. i had the coins, he had the dog. i had also trailed a little bit of guilt with me from the previous beggar encounter. 

i purchased my goods, handed over my notes, and then, as predicted, my hand was filled with cumbersome change. but this time i had a plan. rid myself of guilt and loose change in a single arm movement. i don't know about other people, but i feel awkward passing change to homeless people. guilty when not doing it, awkward when doing it. am i giving enough? is this a tad condescending that i'm walking away with extravagant goods whilst dumping my change to this poor chap who has nothing but some clothes, a dog and a cup?

my plan was to walk out throw the change in the cup, maybe even recall my 'i've-had-a-tough-day' demeanor with a hint of '-but-hey-i'm-still-helping'. out the shop i go, avoiding eye contact, a slight bend of the knee to lower myself closer to the target and i drop 5-6 coins into the cup.

only there is an unexpected splash. it's not a begging cup, it's a cup of coffee. that i've probably just ruined. my face goes bright red (i can be an awkward guy). i freeze and am forced to make unwanted eye contact. 

after an eternity of 3 seconds, i cough (that's an acceptable apology right?) and hastily make my exit. i perhaps should have bought him a new coffee but i'm a cowardly bastard. i'm 95% sure he wasn't even homeless. but that my guilty mind had fashioned some scruffy bloke with his dog and a cup of coffee into the homeless person i could help.

  eventually the side of my driveway is filled with tire tracks and i take the long approach driving diagonally up the side.  this was my first mistake.  mistake number 2 was having the lull arm extended high into the air to keep the tree of the ground.  so i'm going up the side of the driveway and gravity decides to remind me, i can't do that and throws the lull onto it's side.  i don't know what i was thinking except here we go.  the lull starts flipping and i pull myself to the inside and hold on for dear life as i fall at the speed of a scene from 300.  the lull comes crashing down with glass shattering everywhere.
  i look up to see diesel spewing from the fuel tank overtop of me.  now i've seen one or two action movies so i think to myself, oh shit this is where the lull blows up and i die and the thought process was if i shut it off it won't blow up.  (i later learned that won't explode).  the front glass shattered in the crash so i was able to climb out.  i escaped unscavanged except a few cuts on my hands from the glass while crawling out.  sorry i'm not very good at telling stories or grammar, but i thought maybe one person would enjoy my tale.

input: Text: so in the turkish republic foreigners residing in the country for an extended period of time are required to get a residence permit.  today was my appointment.  this occurs at the fatih police station.

a lot of people have trouble finding finding the location within the complex where you turn in your papers.  in light of this, after i turn mine in i thought to myself, ""wouldn't it be useful to create a guide so other people could use it.""  why this guide should include some photos! 

so stupid me decides to act on this, at the time, brilliant idea and on my way out im merrily taking photos of landmarks to use.  since my appointment is late, (9pm) there is nobody around and i can take these photos unabated.  all is well until i get to the front and i take a photo of the building.  i get accosted by what i assume to be a non uniformed police officer and i tell him in turkish that i don't speak enough to understand him.  he takes me to a uniformed officer sporting an mp5 submachine gun and tells him the situation in turkish.  by now i realized i've made a mistake but i have no choice but to ride this rollercoaster until the end.

so since i realize my mistake and i already know what's coming next i hand the officer my device with the photos pulled up and i delete one making sure to show him the process.  he takes it and repeats the process for every photo while asking questions like, 

where are you from?
why are you taking photos?
why are you in turkey?
where do you study?
what do you study?

by this point i'm attracting a lot of attention from the other officers posted in front because there is literally nothing else happening other than cars driving by, it's really late like 9:45pm local time.  so every time another officer joins our new circle of friends i have to repeat my story.  by the end i'm encircled by 6 police officers armed with an assortment of automatic weapons including mp5 and m4 looking weapons that may have been hks since they already had mp5s.  

the last officer that joined our circle of friendship came up on my left and cut me off mid sentence and yelled,""dont panic, dont panic my friend.""  now, i dont feel like i was panicking, i could feel some adrenaline sure but even if i was panicking i feel like i was perfectly within my right to panic because i was encircled by police in a foreign country sporting automatic weapons after doing something very stupid.  

right before this the original english speaking officer asked if i took videos, i hadnt but he had to check anyway.  he watches a few of them, and scrolls through some like he had before with the pictures, at some point he was just admiring my collection, anyway he selects one more to play and this one happened to be me shooting a handgun at an indoor firing range.  so that didn't look good.

anyway, since the new guy joined i had to go through the gauntlet of questions again and this time at the end, kind of out of the blue, he asks if i know of [kevin mitnick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kevin_mitnick).  now, i did two internships at a defense contractor during high school after i performed well in a cyber security competition and at a time i trained to be a penetration tester.  so yeah, i know who kevin mitnick is we hit it off from there.  i had the fortune to take a cybersecurity centric tour of the pentagon before and i happen to have a cio.gov folder from that day that i used to carry all my residence permit shit.  it has a presidential seal on it and binary 1s and 0s aesthetically faded on the interior, they ooo'ed and aaahh'ed at it for a few moments and made polite conversation about hacking and firearms.  when i'm about to leave he says something about a photo and facebook, i didn't ask to clarify because i really wanted to get out of that situation since my fight or flight response was still active.  we exchange goodbyes in turkish after a few steps i say turn and say the equivalent of ""bye-bye"" in turkish and wave.  they respond the same as a group with a smile and i ran to cross the street.

it's weird to think had we been born in the same city we may have been best friends.

turns out i hit the gas and floored it. i went full speed into the back of some 50 year old guy in front of about 75 people. he sat there rubbing his neck the whole time while im sitting here getting yelled at by the person who worked there.

input: Text: i have to be to work everyday at 8:00 am. i do not need to clock in, but i am a contractor and it is really easy to get fired without warning. the commute is 20-45 minutes depending on traffic. anyway, the last time i drove my car i was too lazy to refuel my car and did not fill up before heading home. i completely forgot about this fact and this morning, after getting my morning donuts i looked at the gauge and the time.  the needle was on the empty and it was 7:41am.  i knew if i fueled up, i would definitely be late and get in trouble if not fired. if i chose to go directly to work, i risk running out of gas and being terribly late or simply getting to work on time.  i chose poorly.  

i did not want to run out of gas, so i decided to fuel up and be a couple of minutes late. i still rushed as fast as i could to minimize the time it took to refuel.  i prepared the words i would use while i was fueling up and on my way to work. refueling cost me 7 minutes. this would put me getting to work about 10 minutes late. it is not unheard of for traffic to set someone back that far, so i was prepared to lie, using that as an excuse. now 7:48 i drive as fast as i was comfortable with to get to work. apparently, i drove a bit too fast; i got pulled over by the cops. i could probably write some interesting dialog that sounds like some kind of a joke, but let's just say i was embarrassed. the cop gave me a $140 ticket for speeding and a court date to assess the damage i did to the fuel pump. in my rush, i left the handle in my gas tank and when i took off, i snapped the connector. fortunately, the handle of the pump was designed with dummies like me in mind and it snapped right where it could easily be repaired. i showed up to work an hour late this morning. i hope they will give me leniency since i have a citation to prove it was the cop that slowed me down.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened over the summer, but it was the most embarrasing situation i've ever been in. i'm a sixteen year old guy, but i'm pretty tall for my age, about 6'3.

anyway, my brother and his buddies decide to head out for a party that night. i had a date with a girl i really liked (an hour after the party started) and mum was out of town taking care of grandma after her knee surgery. i really wanted to start things off right with this girl because she was literally perfect. cute, smart, funny, and a little geeky like me. i got myself a new shirt and cleaned up nicely. i was ready for this.

my brother didn't want to come back and pick me up, so he took me with him. now my brother isn't the smartest guy and two weeks ago he bought this old, junky car that probably couldn't last more than six months. we were finding problems with this piece of shit literally every three days.

so i get into the car and buckle up. immediately, i knew something was wrong. the clip took a lot more effort to put in and it snapped closed when i finally pushed it in. i thought, no big deal, it's just old. my brother and his friends get in and i get to go to the party place. it's the middle of summer vacation, so everybody's outside and in the pool. the car (piece of shit that it is) doesn't have working windows, so it's almost 110 degrees inside. my brother and his friends get out of this heat and i go to unbuckle myself. that's weird. the button's not going down. i push the buckle again, a lot harder than i need to. nothing. the damn thing stays locked! i think, okay, i'll just extend the belt and pull myself out. nope. the belt is locked in place.

i was stuck in that car for the next sixty minutes. my tall, lanky body sweated itself out, and then boiled itself in that little metal box. but the smell...oh god the smell. i am not a person who has a problem with bad b.o, but the stench of that car baked itself into my skin.

i finally see my brother coming back. i'm sitting in the back, and he's basically carrying this other guy with him. he said something about vodka, and this dude was about as drunk as you could get. my brother basically dumped him into the seat next to me and got in the driver's seat to take me to my date.

at this point, i'm not sure why i still wanted to go. i probably smelled like the entire boy's locker room distilled into one teenage boy. we get to the fountain (where i was going to meet this girl), and this drunk turns around and throws up in my lap. this foul-smelling green concoction of guacamole, vodka, and stomach acid. right onto my new shirt and clean jeans. i sat there, shocked.

my date was already there and she was looking for me. i decide to just text her and call off the date. two seconds after i send her the text, i see her coming towards the car, looking like she was ready to kill me. keep in mind, this car's windows don't work. she tells me to roll down the window. i try to signal to her that the windows don't work and to go away(i didn't want her to see me with the dude or the vomit) but she looks shocked and starts crying. i told my brother to just drive home. he was just sitting there, laughing his ass off. as i later found out, my date had a crush on me for quite a bit of time, and i basically told her to get lost on what would have been our first date.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: hey, so, this happened yesterday but after it all i was too tired to do much but crawl into bed with food & netflix till i passed out so just be happy it happened this year, ok? awesome, shall we begin?

i'll start off by explaining i work in a museum as part of the education team which means i teach school groups most days. yesterday we had a school we weren't expecting show up (which doesn't happen often but still happens) but it was only one class so while another member of our team lead the group i spent most of the day getting on with preparing a presentation i have to give in a few weeks.

now we're a fairly laid back office on days like this & recently when i'm busy at home i generally have something playing on netflix in the background, so much so that i'm used to have background noise while i'm working on anything for a long period of time, so i spent most of yesterday working on my presentation with 'scrubs' on in the background. 

most days i work from 9-4 but on tuesdays i finish at 3 because i have to get from work to a brownie unit i've been helping with but that's currently on hold however i still planned to leave early as i had two flat viewings that evening with bob (the fiance mentioned in previous posts), one at 4:30 & one at 5. now at lunch time bob rang me to say he wasn't well & wouldn't be able to make the viewings, so i rang & cancelled the 4:30 one as it was a secondary viewing booked because he got held up at work last week & couldn't make it there last week & it seemed pointless viewing it alone again but we decided i should go to the other one & report back if it was any good. i told him to go to bed & get some rest then had some lunch before getting back to work.
i keep working on my presentation, 'scrubs' happily playing on in the background & before i know it, it's 3 o'clock. now usually i'd be out like a shot (not that i don't love my job but that office gets really hot & stuffy) but i'm doing well with my work & it won't take me two hours to get to this flat so i decide to get a drink then stick around till half past instead, not so long that i'd be late but long enough to get a bit more work done & one more episode of 'scrubs' to play, seems like a good plan, don't you think?

so i keep going till half past, i save, shut down, sign out & head for the bus stop. the bus is late of course, as usual but it eventually turns up & i get on & start my way to this flat. i get into town at about quarter to & worry i might be a tad late so i ring the estate agent to let them know just in case then head off to get the bus that will take me closer to where i need to be. this bus is also late but i get on & at 4:59 i am sitting in my seat on the top deck, waiting for us to move when suddenly another bus comes up to pull in at the stop just in front of the one my bus is at. 

now this particular street is part of a busy bus station that also allows general traffic, so at times this street can be packed with vehicles & clearly this particular bus driver doesn't have the patience to wait for anyone else to move so he can pull in & he obviously thinks that there's enough space for him to get past...he's almost right, almost. 

for a moment he glides past with ease then suddenly there's a horribly loud, wrenching, unfamiliar noise that sounds a lot like something breaking & quite a few people seem more than a bit concerned with the events unfolding outside of our bus. after about a minute or so we hear the inevitable sentence ""you'll have to get off & wait for the next one""...shit. we all pile off & only then to we see what's really happened, the moving bus has almost made it but for that darn protrusion at the front of our bus known as the wing mirror...which is now in two parts, the arm lying on the ground, abandoned by the actual mirror which is now residing on the dashboard inside the bus, a hitherto unexplored area now accessed due to the window now broken & spread across the road. the bus that was moving also has a broken window at the back (really hope no one was sat there at the time, there didn't seem to be anyone hurt thankfully). i look at this scene as anger flashes briefly through me, soon replaced by acceptance at my shitty luck, why am i surprised? i take out my phone to call the estate agent 

""sorry, i'm going to be later than expected, my bus was just hit by another bus"" 

""oh, wow, well we can wait around for you but we have to have the keys back at the office by half past so if you make it by twenty past you'll only have a few minutes to look around, you'll have to hurry, see you soon""

...shit. the time is now 5:18 & i'm trapped in the back corner of a completely packed single decker trying to hold everyone who just got off the double decker, panicking that when i get there a, i won't be able to get off because of all the people & b, the estate agent will have gone already.

at 5:25 i squeeze my way off the bus, apologizing to everyone i have to push past on my way, & run from the stop round the corner, following the dot on my phone & praying she's still there...she is, thank god! & after all that effort? it's not really that great, not what i was expecting & definitely not what bob & i are looking for, oh well, such is life, guess we'll just have to keep looking, eh?

input: Text: met this girl in a nightclub, seemed fairly into me from the get go but playing a little hard to get. club closes and she's basically sticking with me the whole time. she's with a couple of friends but says she lives on the other side of the city. we goof around for a while in the city and get with each other a few times then eventually get the metro towards her place. 

we get off the metro and her and her friends all just randomly leg it. i follow for a bit, and they just laugh and keep running. turn a few more corners and they are gone. now i'm on the other side of the city and its 4am...$40 taxi back to where i've come from.

i've had games played before...but really would you drag a guy halfway across the city just to run away and see his reaction?!

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i like hats. particular now that i'm going bald and need to protect my dome from the sun. but a hat can give a person character also. personally, i like stetsons, barmahs and panama hats. the gambler hat looks cool too but the undertaker pretty much killed the look for me from overuse. i even like the original federas - not these newer clown hats without a brim, many of them here being sold in tourist stores. 

right now i own a straw western type hat. it's not your atypical hat unless you are a mexican landscaper or do other work activities in the sun. underneath this, because i have a bald head, i wear a bandanna to keep the itch away, and to help keep my head cooler. 

today,  i wanted another hat. one with a bit more character than this straw hat. i want a barmah. i've been wanting another one for a while actually. i have had one in the past, though that one may not have been an original, it still did well. 

i charted a few hat store locations via google maps and knew of 2 from my past purchase of a barmah. all of these locations were on ""the strip"" in las ridiculous . right now i don't have a car so i'll be walking. the strip's not that far anyway. so i dressed for comfort and went out the door.

i've forgotten how hot it gets in vegas. at 12 pm at the start of my adventure,  it was already reaching 100. but that's ok. living here, i've learned to always bring water, no matter if it's just across the street, or across the desert. i have ran an average of 3 to 5 miles 3 times a week. but not in heat like this. the strip was about 5 miles away. on the way i made a few stops for more water. 

the first destination, the store didn't exist, nor did the second, or even the 3rd. in the process, i have walked the entire strip and back. and because of my running experience chose to run up and down steps instead of waiting on escalator tourists. 

my last hope was in the venetian. i had already past it because the old hat shop was in front nearby, but was no longer there, but the maps showed one near here. fuck it, i'll try the forum shops. they are a kind of upper class kind of place, specializing in name brands  and such. it really is the best place to have a name brand hat shop.

this place is huge! i was wandering around and seeing a lot of food court, so i figured it to be a good time for a restroom stop and to fill my bottle. then i found a cool shaving place and was a bit timid going in because i didn't really bring enough money for all that. after looking at a few creams and double edges, i basically stated, ""na, i better go before i start buying everything "" 

thinking back. this may have been the point that put me under radar.

i was still searching for this supposed store. if it exists. i checked the map but nothing popped out at me. i seen a group of security that i passed and turned around and asked them. one pointed me in a direction stating ""keep right"" 

""oh cool. how did i pass it?"" 

walked a ways staying on the right, past another fork because there didnt seem like anything down there. but didn't see anything else none the less. fine. lets try this other direction anyway.

 at that corridor, there now existed a big beef of a guy, dressed much differently than the other security.  he looked the part of 3rd world soldier minus the cigar and machine gun. and he was looking at me. but whatever, not my concern, though i noticed him turn in the same general direction as i went, but much more slower.down this corridor on the right was a restaurant, on the left i don't even remember. maybe a small gift shop, and in front of me was the exit. nope, nothing this way. i must have missed it again somewhere. i started back down the corridor while seeing this cuban dictator staring me down and started angling to stop me before i passed.

oh. fuck. i just realized i gone goofed. i was quite unshaven, and my shirt had a hole in it and probably looked like shit from all the sweat and salt of the day, and running up and down stairs. i also happened to be in need of new shoes. i definitely looked the part of the homeless man which are literately everywhere on the strip these days. 

""whatcha looking for?"" 

myself: ""oh, i am looking for a hat shop that's supposed to be in here or around the venison.""

""i think you have the wrong cassino.""

i took the hint. even if there was a hat store, they didn't want what appeared to them as homeless in their shops.

myself: "" oh ok, thank you""

feeling dejected i decided to walk back home.

10 waterbottles later and back home, i now understand why they call them sweatpants. i literally sweated in them the entire time. sitting down was not fun. i had a huge heatrash from my ass crack to the entire sack of my balls which burned like hell. it also felt like i went through leg day. probably because of those steps.

input: Text: so this happened earlier this week at my university where i was running a bit late for my lecture. right outside the classroom there were two people fighting, a young lady in her late twenties and a man of about 40. the woman was clawing for the man's eyes and screaming ""kill him! kill him!"". the man was trying to pin her arms down and control her.

instead of intervening i walked up to them and asked if they wanted help. i was directing this to the man since people were standing around and one was calling for police. neither the man nor the woman replied and i continued in to my class. later when police came to the scene and i learned that the student had been banned from the school and had attacked the lecturer when he told her to leave it felt really silly that i hadn't helped him restrain her. it struck me much later how bizarre it was to ask two people fighting ""hey do you want some help?""   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

input: Text: literally just happened less than 15 minutes ago.
i decided to fry some breaded pork chops in my cast iron skillet. i get the oil to a nice hot 375 degrees and place my pork chops one at a time into the oil.

here's the laziness part of my fuck up: i go into my utensil drawer and there's only one clean fork left in there. i probably should have just gone into my dishwasher and cleaned a second fork for dining and used one for cooking, but like i said i was being lazy.

so, i cook the first pork chop to satisfaction and take it out of the oil. i am also hungry and start cutting open the pork chop after i put the second on in the oil. after flipping the second chop (using aforementioned only fork) i go back to my already cut up chop, and immediately take a piece to bite. of course, i didn't consider waiting a minute or so for the fork which i was just swishing around in the hot oil to cool down.

i now have a fork shaped second degree burn in the corner of my mouth and on my lips; but damn are these pork chops tasty.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: long time lurker, first time poster. like most this f up occured quite a few years ago. almost 9 to be exact, the day before my 16th birthday. 

so i decided to hang out with my younger sister, and her two friends, one of which was a guy about her age. she is only a few years younger than me. we decided to head to this wooded part of a subdivision down the road the road from our house on bikes, its almost right acrossed the road from our local bmx track and there was a race going on at the time. 

being the younger rebels that we were, most of us had already picked up the habit if smoking so i always had a lighter on me. so not thinking about what could happen or the consequences that could happen after that. we started usong the lighter to light some pine needles on fire, i used it the first time and lit a small fire, seeing how quickly it spread i put it out. i was the oldest in the group and had more common sense than the other 3 even though it wasnt very much more.

so my sisters guy friend had asked to see my lighter, and of course being the dumbass i was, i let him use it. well he used it on a small fallen pine tree that happened to have a bunch of dead needles on it. the fire started to get pretty big so when i went to put it out he had stopped me and said wait a couple more seconds. i have no clue why i listened to him because in that couple seconds the fire became so unmanageable. our first instinct was to throw dirt on it, well thats wasnt quite working. next thing you know this fire is spreading acrossed this pine wooda quickly. 

so we did the next logical thing, because we didnt want to see any nearby homes catch fire, we called 911. at this point, this kid is panicking, talking about how he will get in so much trouble blah blah blah. i felt bad for him, he was a few years younger than me so i told him to take his bike and head home and i would deal with the police and firefighters even though mind you, he is the one who started that fire. i was already on juvenile probation at the time so i figured what else could it really hurt. later, did i find out it really couldve hurt alot. so he takes off for his house as quick as possible. 

next thing you know the police and firefighters show up and while the cops talking to me filling out a police report, the firefighters put out the fire. i told the cop that i had started the fire. he takes me and my sister home and tells my mom that i was lucky that i wasnt a day older or he would've taken me straight to juvenile detention.  

i almost got hit with a felony arson charge for that but my probation officer helped me get it down to a misdemeanor of unability to contain a fire and extended probation for six more months and i also had to take a couple fire safety courses courtesy of the fire department.

this just happened 10 minutes ago.
i have a propane torch i played with outside and melted some snow  outside our garage port and i decided to melt something more that just snow with it.

so i got this big chunk of maybe 50 grams of tin that i put on in jar lid and melted. the lid was surrounded by snow since it melted through the snow down to the ground.
so i decided to move the lid a bit to make it lay more even and not risking to tip over.
and now i really goofed, i accidentally tipped the lid too much so the tin poured down on the snow.
pop! and since i was crouching over the tin splattered right all over my face.

input: Text: today, at the gym, i was having a wonderful morning with a red bull and a bench press. the way my gym is set up, there is a leg press machine where your back is kind of to the ground at a 45* angle and you push up with your legs as the weight comes down at you, almost like an inverted squat. i'm sure most of you have seen this machine before. to its right, there is a chest butterfly machine, and to its left, there is a curling machine. on the curling machine was a 30-40 yr old guy. on the leg press is a 20-25 yr old girl. as i was saying about the machines, the girl's face is about 2 ft lower than the guy's face since the leg press has you basically laying down. 

  i was sitting up waiting to start my next set while something awesomely bad happened. mid-curl, the older male turned his head to his right and sneezed right onto the younger gal. i saw projectile. in my mind i even felt the mist landing on her. i'm listening to cypress hill by the way. i took off my headphones to see this play out. the girl shrieked and then started to cry. the guy said he was sorry and walked away embarrassed. for some reason, i walked to the disinfectant, sprayed it on a paper towel and tried to hand it to her to maybe wipe her arms or something. she looked at me and said, ""and what the fuck is this going to do?"". she then took the paper towel spit on it and wiped it on my arm. then said,""there, now your clean right?"" 

  luckily, one personal trainer saw this. he told her to leave and that i was just trying to help.

input: Text: so this didn't happen today, but it was over thanksgiving break in 2012. i lived in south lake tahoe, california, and my parents live in wisconsin. to start the story, i used to be prescribed a large amount of benzodiazepines (klonipin and xanax), as well as live in a city where marijuana is more than acceptable, and on the border of nevada so there are a dozen or so casinos just a few minutes away. if anyone has drank while taking xanax or any other type of benzo, you know that it is a recipe for blacking out, and often disaster.  in my infinite wisdom when i was 22 years old and in the middle of a xanax blackout, i decided to bring a quarter ounce of weed in my carry-on bag that i was packing for my trip home the next day. fast forward to a day later, my girlfriend is dropping me off at the airport in reno, nevada (the closest large airport) and i have taken so many pills that i can barely say goodbye, let alone walk myself into the airport and go through security. i didnt check a bag so all i had was my carry-on, and somehow i made it through security completely fine. i have about 40 minutes before my flight leaves at this point, and i decide to get a drink at the airport bar. i start talking to someone and lose track of time after a couple beers and i hear my name being announced over the loudspeaker. i had almost missed my flight, and i hurried to get on the plane. up until this point everything was fine and i was on my way home. i had a connecting flight in minneapolis that take me on the final leg home. after the flight takes off, i take a couple more of my 2 mg xanax and proceed to order some beers. i dont remember exactly how many beers i had on the plane, but it couldn't have been more than 4 or 5 . this combined with 20 plus milligrams of xanax caused me to go into a deep sleep. somewhere during the flight i passed out, however when it came time to get off the plane, no one could wake me up. i was breathing, but basically in a drug and alcohol induced coma. the police were called and they had to basically carry me out of the airport. the last thing i vaguely remember is walking out of the terminal with a police officer on both sides. the next morning at around 5 am i woke up, with both arms restrained in a hospital type bed. i immediately screamed, and a nurse came and untied me. i asked what happened, they informed me of the events, said they had talked to my dad and he had rescheduled my flight for later that morning, handed me all of my stuff along with a police report and my new plane ticket and told me to be on my way. i had a short walk to the airport from the hospital, and i began reading the police report. i had completely forgotten about the weed that i had in my backpack, and the police had found it. in the report it said that they found a container with ""medical marijuana"" in it, along with my empty bottle of prescription pills. they took the bud, but somehow i managed to escape that situation without any tickets or criminal charges. my family was extremely worried and disappointed when i didn't show up as scheduled, but in the end everything worked out.

 i have been so lucky multiple times in my life, and i thank god that i know better than to do this type of this now. i don't know if i ever actually got arrested either, this whole memory is kinda a blur for obvious reasons. my dad still has the copy of the police report that i was handed after this all happened. maybe i will ask him for it soon and post it if anyone is interested. i also have 2 or 3 other stories that involve me getting extremely lucky, i might post them later separately.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: obligatory ""this happened a while ago.""

it's my sophomore year in hs and i'm trying my best to make friends and not let my social awkwardness get the better of me. i had this crush on a girl who we'll just refer to as sarah. i managed to finally get her to come to the mall with me and we actually have a pleasant time. but about an hour in we pass by a makeup shop... sarah, of course, gets this wonderful idea that it would be just amazing if she could do my makeup here. my awkward teenaged mind wasn't throwing any red flags, so i accepted. i'm in that shop for almost a full half an hour and she's finally doing the finishing touches on my previously ok face. she insist i don't get to see what i look like until we're done. but i already know what i look like. i see people staring from the main hall outside the store. i was socially adept enough to know that the faces people were making meant that i... looked... bad.

now that we're done with adding makeup to my face, i'm dying to get it off already. i look like the lead singers from kiss and slipknot had a cosmetic breakdown on my face. i legitimately looked like one of those troubled teens going through ""that phase,"" except to an extreme extent. now she's making me walk all around the mall. my mind is yelling at me to make her take it off, while on the outside i'm trying to nonchalantly walk with my friend like nothing's wrong. she has to use the restroom, so i get the pleasure of waiting outside facing everyone in the hall. i child looks at me, then to his mother he ask, ""mom why is that man so scary."" thankfully the mother didn't say anything, i might have collapsed in tears. sarah comes back out from the restroom, and i'm begging her to take it off. i become a bad friend for making her take my makeup off, thus ruining everything i worked towards getting on her good side. seriously, fuck the way everyone's mind worked at that age.

now we walk back into the makeup shop from earlier and an old friend of sarah's sees her. they we're about to make a quick exchange of greetings but then, she saw me. she quickly takes me to the back and does her best to remove/cover all of my makeup. she had already figured out how i got in this mess, because little words were exchanged between us and she had acted so quickly. she had basically told me not to do this to myself, which i made sure i haven't done since.

 

this fucking sucked and had it happened more recently, probably would have been recorded. thanks for reading, and i hope this'll make someone's day. also apologies if formatting is crap from my mobile.

input: Text: so to give you an idea of my surroundings, i have a small desk with a few things on it. there's an ethernet cable strung around the front of my desk to my dvd player since it's a hassle to get it around back and it was only temporary. there's also one of those plastic things you put on the floor to keep messes off of the carpet. there isn't much room left for my tea, so i just set it beside me, which happened to be in front of the cord.

i really had to use the bathroom, so i got up to do so and as the genius i am i start walking and trip over the cord. the router/modem thingie (i think it's both in one, but i'm not 100% on that.) falls over and my tea topples off the desk. at this point i'd like to mention that the glass i was using was big as hell. it was probably 24 ounces and about 2/3 full, so as you can imagine it was a mess. when it fell it also went all down my pants and off of the plastic carpet protector thing. lucky me.

the towel closet is right next to my room.my mom is in the living room in clear view of my room, so i sneak out and get a towel as quietly as possible. mission accomplished. i go back to my room and start wiping up the sticky, stain-making sweet tea. at this point my mom comes in here to hand me some papers for school. she, of course, sees me vigorously wiping the (surprisingly not stained) carpet. she asks me what the ruckus is about and i just mumble answers because i'm ashamed of how stupid i was. i guess she mistook it for passive-agression because she got pissed and walked off. now i'm just sitting here writing this with yet another glass of tea. wish me luck in not doing something dumb!

anyway, in my excitement, today i sent a girl a message saying only: 'netflix and chill?' she says yes, and comes over. yeey, finally a real world meme coming to life outside of the us. she comes over, we fool around, have a good time.

now, my understanding of 'netflix and chill' is just  a hookup. wasn't looking for anything else, don't really have the time. as she leaves, i walk her to the bus station, and by the time i get back, i see a relationship request in my facebook notifications. so as much as i thought she was familiar with a lot of memes, obviously i misplayed.

okay, so i'm on my school group. there's 49 students on it. i meet them nearly everyday. i've never sent anything on it, nor am i social irl. i'm the guy that sits in a corner doodling, avoiding social contact.  

anyway, today, i decided to break my virtual silence. the topic of conversation was one of our dickhead teachers, who happens to be a muslim. a dude cracked a mildly offensive muslim joke and i don't know why, it made the light bulb in my head shine bright. you see, i'm the guy that loves dark humour, and i often spend hours on /r/imgoingtohellforthis and on 4chan, so i have a wide array of offensive jokes. i think 'fuck i gotta send this shit to them. they'll think i'm hilarious!', forgetting that there's stupid religious people in my class who quite obviously won't find it funny.  

anyway, i post this (http://imgur.com/4mfljjq). it doesn't exactly settle well... i start freaking out. i still am freaked out. there's a guy who thinks this joke is racist? huh... normally, i'd call him a foolish mango; seeing how islam is a religion, not a race, but at that moment i felt strangely apologetic. basically, i just went batshit crazy in my irrational freak out period and apologised for something that i wouldn't usually apologise. everyone thinks i'm even weirder now. great. i'm contemplating on being a professional hermit now. i definitely have social anxiety.

input: Text: so this fuck-up happened literally 30 minutes ago. 

for the past couple weeks, my mom has been meticulously planning a surprise birthday party for my sister, whose birthday is in late march. my sister loves surprises and my mom is trying to be extremely secretive about this party in order to really catch my sister off guard. my mom doesn't let anybody discuss details of the party while my sister is in the house and even created a fake email account to plan the party, just in case my sister somehow sees my mom's emails and discovers the surprise. as you can tell, my mom is really serious about this surprise party and wants to it to be a mind-blowing experience for my sister. as a result, my mom as booked a popular dj, a fashion lady (or something like that - i don't know the actual title) to give all the girls at the party make-overs and whatnot, as well several expensive birthday presents. the next step for my mom was to discreetly invite a bunch of my sister's friends (i think about 10-15 in total) by sending an email (using the fake email account) to each friend asking if they are available to attend the party.

here's where i get involved: 

i'm on facebook today looking at pictures and scrolling through my news feed just like any other day when one of my friends suddenly chats me. 

him: ""dude i got a weird email from your mom. i think she sent it to the wrong person.""

me: ""oh really? what is it about?""

him: ""it's an invitation for some girl named samantha to attend your sister's birthday or something. how did your mom even get my email address?""

me: ""hahaha. that must be for my sister's surprise birthday party. i have no idea how my mom sent *you* that email though. i'll go ask her.""

immediately after this conversation i try to ask my mom why she sent my friend that email. so usually when i try to ask my mom for something and she is in the living room and i am on the second floor of my house, i just yell really loudly to get her attention. so, without thinking, i scream, ""hey mom! why did you send an invitation to *friend's name* for *sister's name*'s party? i think you meant to send it to samantha!"" while i was so caught up in why my mom sent my friend that wrong email, i didn't realize that my sister's room was right next to where i was standing. i take a peek inside the room (somehow hoping that my sister didn't hear what i had just yelled) and much to my dismay, my sister is sitting on her bed where she was definitely able to hear everything that just happened. 

oops. needless to say, but my mom was pissed.

i pull up to her house and i'm feeling very confident. this is her parents house, so i'm not going inside, but i'm certain i can at least get some hot smooch action before i go. she thanks me for the ride and then we stare at each other for a few seconds. i decide to go in for the kiss slowly, real smooth-like. our lips meet and there is a single moment of sexiness before a loud bang and our heads jolt forward. turns out i hadn't put the truck in park, so when i leaned in for the kiss my foot was removed from the brake, resulting in me slowly rolling into the back of her dads car. 
her dad then came outside in his pajamas, yelled at me, assessed the damage (thank god there was none) and sent me on my way. i drove off in my tiny sad truck and never heard from her again.

input: Text: first things first - i am usually against using herbicides and/or pesticides for home lawncare. last july, however, i needed to fill some cracks in my driveway. the only problem? dandelions were growing in the cracks. so, like any honest son of a pei homeowner, i found an old container of concentrated weedout and went to work.

conveniently, the container had a built-in spray nozzle attached to a tube - no need to tilt it and risk spilling it anywhere. if i'm going to use herbicide, might as well minimize the impact, right? so i happily sprayed each and every dandelion i saw in the driveway. great! there's still half the bottle left for next year! so i put the container on a shelf in the shed, washed my hands, and forgot about it.

today, i opened the shed and looked at the shelf. the nozzle was sitting on the shelf next to the mostly emptied container - fuckfuckfuck - surrounded by a sticky puddle of half-crystallized weed killer. i figured out that the tube had still been full when i put it away - the container acted as a siphon, emptying itself out. now i can look forward to cleaning up some carcinogens tomorrow :|. so much for minimizing spill damage.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i was riding the bus home this morning after working a 12-hour night shift without much sleep before work. i did what i usually do on the ride home, which consists of alternating between passing out and waking up every thirty seconds or so. for some reason the combination of falling asleep and the vibrations from sitting over the rear wheel of the bus commissioned a rigid, throbbing, leaning tower of mushroom meat in my pants. i woke up after a middle aged, southeast asian lady occupied the seat next to me, her legs awkwardly touching mine and her breast rubbing against my arm with every pothole as we shared a seat in the confined rear corner of this stinking vessel for the disabled and vehicularly challenged.   
  
i panicked. my stop was approaching and i was battling a trouser dragon which i could not slay. her unintended grinding and the bumpy road certainly did not help my cause. i considered riding the bus all the way around town until my man steak returned to medium rare, but this was not an option as i had to be home to let my girlfriend in, who did not yet have a key to the apartment.  
  
so i pressed the button to signal the driver to stop, planning in detail how i would exit the bus without alerting my fellow passengers to the angle of my dangle. i would put my backpack in front of my junk, stand up, and walk out the back door. the perfect crime.  
  
**where i fucked up:** as i stood up, i dropped my bag. no fear, i thought, her satellites haven't detected my surface-to-air missile yet, i will just bend over and pick up my knapsack and carry on. so i did, i bent over, inadvertently tucking my cock rocket back behind my legs. as soon as i retrieved my back pack and stood up, i noticed she was getting up from her seat. too late. wrong place, wrong time, one inch too far. in a cruel twist of fate, the instant she arose from her seat, my beef torpedo launched from between my legs and slapped her square in the jaw. fucking track pants allowed maximum velocity, too. nothing but jeans from now on.   
 
  
i was off the bus and running for my life before i had a chance to witness the look of horror that was undoubtedly pasted on her face. i am never riding that bus again. *never.*

input: Text: okay, so i have just created an account after lurking and getting schadenfreude from posts here, it is only fair that i return the favour. 

i work at a supermarket in new zealand as a grocery assistant, nothing fancy but it pays the bills for now. a big complaint i have about my uniform is that it is not well suited for physical work, the trousers are especially inflexible which results in tears down the seam of the pants. i have been fed up with resewing time and time again and have elected to use a few safety pins threaded through the split to keep my trousers together until i can be bothered fixing them.

so, work as usual yesterday and i am walking back to where i am working, and i decided to walk through the least crowded aisle, which contains snack foods on one side and baby needs and wax, condoms and lube on the other. there are only a couple of young guys down there, i'd guess mid twenties, and when i get closer i see that they are a couple, no big deal to me. they take little notice of me and are looking at the lube. as i pass them however, my pants feel a bit weird, they are moving just slightly strangely on me and that is when i feel one of the safety pins stabbing into my upper inner thigh and i yelped ""jesus that hurts!"" whilst clutching that backside of my trousers and limping off, only to look back at them to see if they heard me out of mild embarrassment. i was not even thinking about what it looked like, until i saw one of them scowling at me, his partner merely nonplussed with the lube in his hand. i turned back the direction i was heading in disbelief at what i had just done and feeling absolutely awful. 

so yeah, i would say i fucked up.

""i'm sure w thinks its ok"" that in hindsight was a bit of a stretch. ""you are in my bed, that means you want it"". i could only think that she would hate me if i said no. so i caved in. i did enjoy it (she is gorgeous, has a great body, stamina, and is quite talented). i remember feeling that i had to keep focusing on pleasing her, i couldn't focus on myself. after a few hours of that we went to sleep and the next morning i was kinda still drunk. i want sure if i was feeling a hangover or regret the next day. i haven't told w yet. i don't know how. we are all supposed to hang out in a few weeks. i guess i feel really guilty and dumb for getting myself into a situation i couldn't back. i fucked up. i'm a dick. i kinda hate myself. lay it on me.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this actually happened sunday, but started about a week ago. i woke up at 3am with severe pain in my chest and left arm. my first though was ""shit, i'm having a fucking heart attack!"". i'm 44m and takes meds for anxiety, so my second thought was that a panic attack or stress made a lot more sense. i grabbed my phone and googled the symptoms, and panic attack did fit. i had no other symptoms. wasn't sweating, no shortness of breath. no rapid heartbeat. it went away after about 20 minutes, and i went back to sleep.

a few days later i decided to walk on my treadmill and after 3 minutes i had some mild chest discomfort. it quickly went away with rest, so i called and made an appointment with my doctor on thursday. ekg was normal. he assumed stress, but was a bit concerned that pain came back with activity. we scheduled an appointment to see a cardiologist for monday. 

on saturday night at bedtime i had pain again, but seeing as the ekg was normal, i ignored it. same thing sunday, but figured i'd go to the er and get another ekg just in case. that one also looked normal, but after checking the one from thursday they noticed a ""subtle difference"" and decided i needed to be at a bigger hospital. 

i arrived at that hospital at 1am monday morning. by 9am i had a stent in the left anterior descending artery (also known as the ""widow maker"") of my heart due to a 95% blockage. the cardiologist and nurses all said i was lucky to be alive, and had i waited i likely would have had a heart attack. due to where the blockage was, that would have killed me before i could have gotten medical help.

input: Text: this happened when i was fifteen. for background i grew up in hickville, usa and the high school i went to was crazy. about 95% of the guys chewed (really dipped as everyone had copenhagen rather than redman) tobacco or smoked. people were showing up drunk on the daily. people got expelled for bringing guns onto campus so they could sell them (this was after columbine and newtown, and shame on the school's administration for not locking down the school each time they knew about it).  almost everyone carried knives. i was in the majority that used tobacco. around that time i was dipping like crazy. 

the night before the fuck up i was caught by my dad (an essentially straight edge man who rarely drank and never smoked anything in his life) while i had a massive dip in.  i swallowed the fat dip i had in so naturally i threw up (i couldn't stomach it at all) a lot. i had just gotten three cans of grizzly that day and didn't want to waste them. so the next morning i faked being sick so i could stay home as i didn't sleep that night.  

so onto the fuck up. i decided to get rid of the cans by dipping them off quickly rather than throw away two and a half cans of wintergreen flavored cancer. i got through the half can and had the biggest nicotine buzz of my life. i then open the second can and put one in while resisting the urge to vomit as at that point me and wintergreen weren't friends. a few minutes later i put another in. i repeat until half of can #2 is gone. 

i then get the familiar gagging and run to the bathroom. i managed to lose half of my stomach acid as i hadn't eaten anything. i got up and was really fucking dizzy, like the house is spinning  at 50 miles an hour. my heart was racing and i was shaking so a lot.  my stomach hurt a lot and i felt like i was still going to vomit. i then went into my room and sat down for a bit. i still felt like i was going to pass out. i got up and laid on the clothes strewn across my bedroom for about an hour. i didn't move aside from the shaking and it still felt like the house was spinning. i ended up blacking out for twenty minutes or so.

i got up and went to the living room and sat on the couch for another hour. then the fog of dizziness and nausea slowly faded away.  you would have thought that that would have swayed me from ever touching that stuff again but that wasn't the case. i ate a leftover steak and opened the can again and dipped more. the exact same thing happened again. i stopped once and for all that day. looking back now i realize what a fucking idiot i was. i'm lucky i didn't fucking die. to this day if someone opens a can around me my stomach does violent barrel rolls.

when my wife scheduled her surgery it was all good. she scheduled it and went through with it on novemember 5th. we were not covered at that time and insurance company probably won't pay for it. they had mailed us the notice of non payment, but those envelopes got buried in the chaos, and i'm not responsible with opening my mail.

the day before follow up surgery, we find out we don't have coverage, just over 3 months passed last payment so i don't think there is anyway to fix this. went from everything going great, to catastrophy

got the explanation of benefits and the total cost is a little over $20,000. i'm just thankful it's not more, but it easily could be.

i'm hoping they will reduce the costs if we pay in cash and give us a discount or payment plan options. wife is furious, it was my job to make sure health insurance is taken care of. man i fucked up

input: Text: i tend to write rather long posts, so  

so long time lurker here but this is my first post. 

mandatory 'did not happen today' but actually two years ago. posting though as my friends still enjoy laughing at it. 

i started learning guitar about 3 years ago. all self-taught by youtube and i became rather comfortable playing the instrument. 

i had progressed quite a bit when my friend and i decided to enter our school's interhouse music competition. we got a band together and entered a group piece. i would be playing guitar and singing. 

my music teacher at school had recently discovered that i could play guitar and sing so she asked me to also enter in a solo piece. i considered this and finally decided to enter as i thought 'hey, it's a good way for me to get out of my comfort zone right?' 

to give you an idea what i was like then, i was shy. i was able to talk in front of 5 people but the moment the group got larger than that, i got stage fright. now what was i thinking registering to play in front of the whole school. 

my band practiced everyday for weeks before the show and i could play and sing the songs in my sleep. unfortunately this left me very little time to practice my own piece. i would practice quickly before leaving for school or before bed, but never enough until i was confident with the piece. 

the night of the show arrives and my band is pumped. we've practiced this over and over again. we were determined to nail this performance. i on the other hand was not feeling that great about my solo piece. 

the show starts and i am to perform my solo piece third and then our band will perform after interval.

the second performance begins and i plug in back stage and get ready. i am practically struggling to stand up straight. second performance finishes and the mc goes up to announce me while i stumble on stage, trembling. i'm thankful for the spotlight which prevents me from seeing the crowd,  but i'm sure it illuminated my embarrassed face even more. the sound engineers give the thumbs up that i can begin. 

i start playing jeff buckley's hallelujah, remembering the lyrics and notes. first verse goes well and i get through the chorus. when i reach the second verse though i suddenly blank. i stop right there on stage in front of my school, trying to figure out what the note was, but my mind was mush. nothing. i do the next appropriate thing i can think of and apologise profusely to the audience. i then, in an obviously shaky voice ask the judges if i may restart. they nod and i start again. 

this time i start and play the song. i missed out the last verse but i keep telling myself that no one notice. i also found out later that i played the wrong chords and sounded completely off, but i was just thankful that it was over and found relief in the fact that i wouldn't have to face my peers until... i played for my band in half an hour. my mortified self realised that my embarrassment would have to be short lived. 

my band finds me during interval, trying to hide my face, and we get ready. instruments are tuned and, after warming up, my voice feels brilliant.

we go on stage and we kill it. we absolutely nailed the song and received a standing applause. 

i definitely fu my first performance but i stepped out of my comfort zone and as a result am much more confident now. this may sound strange, but i'm kind of glad i fu, at least now it can't get worse (i hope). 

tl;dr signed up for a school music competition. forget the words of my solo and made a fool of myself in front of my school but saved my reputation (well most of it) with my band's performance. thank you band! all in all i'm glad i did it as it built confidence.

sorry there hasn't been one yet, but nothing's happened. bit of an anti climax really:

i raised it with my girlfriend by asking to talk about ""those texts i sent you"" and she had no idea what i was talking about. i gave a bit more detail without giving too much away and it was clear they'd never gone through.  

my ipad is wifi only, and so only those people on ios received the messages, meaning the gf and mother are none the wiser. 

in any case, it wasn't something i was actively hiding, it just never came up. i abhor lying and will always tell the truth if asked, so i thought fuck it and told her what i'd sent (without the gruesome details), she was nonplussed, asked a couple of expected questions and semi-jokingly told me that she would cost more. then we ate a pizza. 

so while my mom didn't receive the messages, my sister definitely did, and would have told her about them, in how much detail i don't know. i still haven't spoken to either of them but there's still a chance of a minor shitstorm.

i'll update again if any lols come out of this.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: my son has been in college since last fall. last november, my 16 year old stepdaughter brought up allegations that my son had abused her repeatedly for several years. i confronted my son and he categorically denied it. but i knew that even though he was my son, i could not defend him for such an awful act.

my wife and i reported him to the authorities. my son was arrested in december and held in prison for a several weeks because i refused to provide him bail money. he was eventually expelled from his ivy league college.

in the middle of january, my stepdaughter broke down and admitted she lied about everything. she had actually been having sex with her boyfriend and was scared the news would reach us.

the charges were dismissed and my son was released immediately but the damage was done. his first girlfriend from college ended things with him. the news spread about the allegations and all his childhood friends have decided to just stay away from him even though i called each and every one of them personally.

i have called the school and explained the situation and even though they sympathized, they said he needed to reapply for the next school year and go through the admissions process again. 

my son is understandably furious at us. he has moved back home and refuses to talk to me at all. both my wife and i have apologized to him repeatedly. we have banned my stepdaughter from our home permanently and she has been sent to live with her father in another state. my wife and i also agreed to completely disinherit her from our wills. it has been a very painful situation. all of us started therapy.

the realization of how badly i ruined my son’s life hit me when i picked up his first prescription of anti-depressants today. i bawled my eyes out in my car.

he is the pride and joy of my life. he is outgoing, funny, intelligent and the kindest person i know. but when i handed him his medication, i could not even recognize him. he locks himself in his room, does not eat properly and has lost several pounds so far. 

whenever i try talking to him, i just see the hate he has for me in his eyes. i don’t know if i can ever get him to love me again.

i know he is on reddit very often. t, if you are reading, i want to tell you again how sorry your stepmom and i are. i promise i will get you into college again. i know i can’t get you back the year you lost. but i will do everything in my power to make this right. everything i have has always been for you. i hope you will give me a chance to fix this. i love you so much it hurts. i failed as a father and i hope one day you will forgive me.

this just happened like 20 minutes ago and i had to type this because i felt so dumb.

input: Text: so i moved away from home for the first time at the beginning of this semester, and i've been putting off doing my laundry basically this whole time. i don't have any washing machines in my building, so it's just a big inconvenience i'd like to avoid. anyways after going commando  for a couple of days (which i've discovered is actually wonderful) i finally conceded. 

i don't have any laundry detergent, so i go to the store to pick some up , how hard could it be. well apparently there are a lot of different kinds of laundry detergent, and seeing as i usually just use whatever's around the house i get a little bit lost. luckily, my friend zack is with me and he points one out, ""this one's good,"" he says. "" it smells great."" so i buy it , go home, throw my clothes in a garbage bag (a pretty big garbage bag, considering how long i've avoided laundry) and head out.
the washing machines seem pretty standard, so i pour my detergent in, start it, and then sit around and wait. an hour later it's done and dry, so i throw it back in the garbage bag and head home to fold them. 

as soon as i take them out of the bag the smell hits me, and it's not bad, it's just familiar. memories start pouring in to my mind as this smell rushes through my nostrils, and that's when i realize that i bought the same detergent my ex-girlfriend uses. my whole wardrobe now smells like her now.

input: Text: so this actually happened about a week ago when my girlfriend and i moved into our new place.

we had just finished consummating our new home and smoking a celebratory first house blunt when we decided to go smoke a cigarette. now, going outside is something we never had to do before to smoke a cig. we'd just open a window in the apartment we used to live in and smoke inside. this being the first night at the new place we hadn't properly learned all the locks and what not on the doors. mainly the doorknob locks. never had those before at the apartment, just bolt locks. so happily we go outside in our pjs, me in gym shorts and a crappy white tshirt i had on for most of the day, and her in capitals boxers with an expressions of darth vader tshirt on. both in flip flops. as soon as i shut the back door i knew i had fucked up as i could feel how the knob was locked literally a second too late. i turned to my girl with a look of terror and she knew immediately that i had just caused a first homeowners mistake and locked ourselves out of our house...in our pjs...at midnight...both cell phones upstairs in the bedroom...at about an [8]. we tried all the windows, which were locked, and contemplated breaking a window (as she put it, we have a year to fix it so whatever). of course we ended up deciding to just suck it up and go to a neighbors house, none of which we had met yet. she suggested i go by myself as she was embarrassed to which i responded there's no way in hell anyone in their right mind would open their front door for a guy that looks like me (big beard, big guy, in pjs) at midnight and that having her was essential to getting someone to let us use their phone. 

so we started knocking. we got through about three houses before finally someone opened their door for us. it was a nice asian man and what i presume was his just woken up by our knocking grandma or mother who didn't speak english. i should mention he didn't speak english very well either so it took about five minutes of explaining why we needed his phone and that yes, we really were his neighbors. luckily he had seen our moving truck and believed us.  the whole time they're just staring at my girlfriend probably due to the mix of funny clothing, sex hair, stoned eyes, and no bra while i frantically call my dad so he can bring the spare key out (for the life of me i don't know what made me make an extra earlier that day at home depot, but it saved our ass). after hanging up we thanked him, rosy cheeked and all, as we went to leave. he offered to let us hang out there until my father came but we were way too embarrassed to sit there any longer. my dad decided it was hilarious so he went and picked my mom up and bought some coffees (all the time we're outside in pjs like where the fuck is he?!) to bring over. he was giggling and doing a little dance as he walked up to the house, i guess he thought it was funny as hell (we did too honestly, i'm sure the weed helped). all in all it turned out to be a pretty funny experience, and not gonna lie, i did it again a day later but luckily we had our phones and my dad was close by so we didn't have to go through anything embarrassing again. needless to say we have a hidden key now, but we never lock the doorknob lock anymore anyways. now every time i call my dad he starts off by answering with ""please, not again."" honestly, i can't help but laugh and think of how awesome a story it is for our first night living together. oh, and the house is fucking awwwwesome!

fast forward several hours later to this morning, i'm in the bathroom getting ready for my day. my mind begins to wander when i notice a small, red blob on my shorts. i thought, ""oh! jam!"" i swiped it up with my finger and stuck in my mouth, licking it clean. hmm.... it doesn't taste very sweet. and the texture is a bit mucousy. wait.... i used grape jam. we don't even *have* any strawberry jam. then what did i...? oh. oh my god. ooooh shit. what the fuck did i just put in my mouth? fucking fuck! ack! i began to gag a bit. it was a clot of blood. menstrual blood. i ate my own goddamn fucking menstrual blood and it didn't even *taste good*!!!

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: alright so this happened about 6 months ago but it's probably the stupidest decision i've ever made in my life and quite the story to tell. so anyway my best friend and i were bored over the summer and would always go to ikea/various stores and entertain ourselves usually involving building toilet paper/ mattress forts or even playing kickball in a variety of stores. anyway we were at ikea late at night over the summer and entered a big storage area of the store with 5-6 story high shelves loaded with furniture and cardboard boxes. keep in mind the store closed at 9 and we were in there around 9:45-10....
trying our best not to make any noise or get caught, i thought'd it'd be sweet if we could climb up some of these storage shelves 50-60 ft above the ground and just chill out. so he told me to go first and i just made my way up, realizing it probably wasn't the safest idea we ever had, but hey we were teenagers looking for some fun. so i get about halfway up the structure (30-40 ft) swing my leg up to get higher. i wasn't really focusing on where my leg was going and smacked it on a metal bracket that held the shelf up. at first i didn't really think much of it because it didn't hurt at all and just thought it would bruise up the next day. however, as i pulled myself to my feet on the next shelf, i felt something drop down my leg and sure enough i've got a massive gash on my kneecap and i'm gushing blood all over assorted furniture and cardboard boxes. like these things are soaked and the blood continues to drip shelf by shelf onto more ikea products.
at this point my friend starts to begin to notice what's going on and starts to freak out. i'm working my way down so we can get to an urgent care or something when an ikea employee appears and begins to stock the shelves just below me. this is the point where i'm honestly worried for my life. meanwhile i just wait for this guy to stock his cardboard boxes while i'm sweating bullets 5 ft above him, all the while losing massive amounts of blood which continues to spill on ikea products. he eventually leaves and i make my way down. however, because the store had already closed, these metal barriers had separated the doors from this storage area for god knows what reason. anyway, my friend and i proceed to hop this barrier (still bleeding) and find our way to the men's room. we spent the next 45 minutes stopping the bleeding and making sure we wouldn't get caught on the way out if they hadn't already found the trail of blood we had left. at around 10:45 we stopped hearing the construction sounds/ banging of boxes and decided it was time. we ran out the door( me limping) and booked it down an escalator to my car, hearing people yelling behind us but not stopping for anything. he drove me home where we put cleaned up the wound and had to tell our parents the stupid decision i had made😂. we went to urgent care the next morning and got my knee stitched it up, explaining to my doctor how exactly it had happened. still wondering what they thought about the incident/ how they took care of the blood i left up there😂

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so this story happened a while ago, but when i told it to a friend of mine he urged me to post it here. so here goes..

i was at a party in a flat where only students live and at a certain time i was getting pretty intoxicated. i’m not quite sure how it started, but at some point i was making out with this girl, let’s call her emily, who lived on the same floor the party was at. we wanted some more privacy and thus she was dragging me to her room, which had been seen by some other girls. i think for the story it’s good to know that most people knew each other at this party. the girls who saw us were friends of emily and they all had another friend who i had hooked up with a while before this party. anyway, we entered the bedroom, locked the door and things were progressing to the point where we were no longer wearing clothes. the girls who spotted us thought emily couldn’t do this to their mutual friend and they were banging on the bedroom door. we were pretty drunk and the banging on the door, combined with screaming was kind of disturbing. in fact, emily thought she could convince her friends that i was not in her room, so that they would leave and we could continue. she quickly put some clothes on, but obviously i had to hide and the only place our drunk minds could think of was her closet. so while she was telling her friends to leave, i was hiding in the closet. i honestly believe they could still see my clothes on the floor though.

they soon left though and we were able to continue. about 10 minutes later, i think, they were back and we were getting annoyed. once again she opened the door to tell them to leave. this time i just hid under the blankets; she asked me to. they obviously knew emily wasn’t alone, but she thought she would just say it was someone else who was with her. the girls actually came in the room and i heard them talking right beside me. one person actually sat down on the bed, but that might have been emily as well, i never found out. i was just not giving a fuck (literally) and waiting for them to finally leave, which they eventually did.

 however, this is when shit got weird.. before we went to sleep, i had to pee. emily didn’t want me to go to the toilet, because then her friends would see me coming out of her bedroom. she suggested i used some sort of bucket she had in her room. so, i was peeing in a bucket in her bedroom, which was really strange to me. i remember thinking, why am i even doing this? i was honestly happy that i could sleep after that. in the middle of the night i woke up, when i noticed she was moving around. i was half asleep and not really sure if i was seeing things right, but it seemed as if she was peeing next to the bed. i’m not sure if she realised it, or maybe she thought the bucket was there or something. all i know is that she was still very drunk and i just fell back asleep. and then the morning sun rose and we were both waking up. i just wanted to go home asap and got out of bed to search for my clothes. and then i saw them lying next to the bed, on her side. i remembered waking up in the middle of the night, but i was hoping i had it all wrong. i did not. i picked up my clothes and they were wet. my jeans, shirt and vest had been freaking pissed on. the only thing i thought of was the fact that i had to cycle home for about 20 minutes, and i could not do that in my underwear only. so i just sucked it up, put on my pissed on clothes, cycled home and showered for about an hour while thinking: what the hell happened? emily and i never spoke of the pissed on clothes. i think she was too drunk to remember and i just found it way too awkward to tell her.

 

edit: okay so people seem to think the vest is weird. i'm also not sure if vest is the correct word, maybe its a cardigan. at least this is what it looks like: http://www.asos.com/asos/asos-cardigan-in-teal-green-cotton/prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=6359938&cid=7617&sh=0&pge=0&pgesize=36&sort=-1&clr=teal&totalstyles=462&gridsize=3

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: today i fucked up. after a long shift at work in a restaurant, i sat down on the porcelain throne for my ""evening constitutional."" (i promise that the details about defecation are necessary to set the mood, but that the post doesn't ""center"" around them.)

the men's room here has two urinals and one stall, the latter of which i'm occupying - and i tend to take my time when i go about my business. the stall is excessively large, with room for a diaper changing table and enough handicap access area to fit one and a half hoverounds. the partition blocks off the entire bathroom width (maybe five or six feet), with the door situated in a way that, upon entering the stall, one would have to make a ninety degree turn to navigate to the toilet.

i'd finished dropping the cosby kids off at the community pool and begun my paperwork when i heard a new party enter the bathroom: a trio of voices - two high pitched, one normal masculine - that i can only assume is a father and his two kids. as per usual, they beeline straight for the single stall, and quickly find that the door is locked.

this is not the first time that i've been in this situation in this restroom - last time, an intoxicated fellow decided to have a full conversation with me through the stall walls as he waited not-so-patiently outside. despite the inherent humor in the bawdy conversational material that the man had chosen to regale me with, i was distinctly unhappy at having my poo party-of-one crashed.

i hoped to avoid the same fate this time by ignoring all other would-be stall users. so as this man and his two kids began knocking on the door, i carefully folded the two-ply into a nice stack and lifted my rear off the seat for a big, hopefully final, wipe.

it was this most compromising moment when i caught a flash of motion in the edge of my vision. i look up to see a young girl, maybe five years old, on her hands and knees, half-entered into my private lounge. her eyes get big with surprise.

i make emergency maneuvers, but it is too late. the angle is just right that she had a clear view of my dingling-dangling wonder worm. 

""daddy, it's a boy!"" she gasps, as she retreat crawls back. 

""fucking christ!"" i exclaim, just as astonished (it's a *girl*!) as she at this pickle of a situation.

the father makes an unhappy grunt and yanks his offspring to her feet. i hurry the rest of my visit and shuffle out where we all avoid eye contact.

it's time for bed, my boyfriend lying on his side next to me and i was rubbing his back. i got turned on and tried to ignore it because i knew he would say no. then he turns to his other side and we are now lying face to face. in my head i am thinking, ""okay, just start kissing him while you are still rubbing his back"", so i lift my head a little and move in closer to him. with it being so dark in the room i couldn't tell how close he was to me and landed my cheek right on his nose. he lays on his back and says, ""damn it, my nose is bleeding,"" then gets  up and heads to the rest room. i lie there in my bed feeling like an embarrassed teenage girl who was trying to seduce her boyfriend for the first time. ugh...went to bed feeling horny and embarrassed.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened when i was 7 years old.  


i lived in suburban midwest us, where all the kids in the neighborhood could walk alone to the park and each other's houses well across town.  my best friend lived on the other side of the park and for some reason i had this idea that it would be fun to write her an anonymous letter giving hints about which friend i was, and then inviting her to meet me at the park later to see if she had guessed correctly
.

i decided that the letter had to be typed so the handwriting wouldn't give me away.  this was 1997 and computers were so new that microsoft word was entertaining.  i had played pretend secratary enough that i had taught myself to print addresses on an envelope.  i typed up this long letter and gave her 3 clues describing who i was and set a future date for her to meet me.
    
a week or so goes by and i've pretty much forgotten about the letter when we get a frantic phone call from my friend's mom asking if i had received any suspicious mail.  she was so upset when she saw the letter that she went immediately to the police.  due to the typed envelope and the advanced grammar (thanks mom) the police believed there was no way this letter was from a 7 year old but surely a local child molester.  then undercover agents were sent to stake out the park and wait for his arrival.
her mom was calling all the parents in town warning them to check the mail and be on the lookout for local predators.

i got grounded *for lying about my involvement  at first* for quite awhile and was scared straight after i had to tell my story to the policeman.  whoops.

*edit:  yes, everyone, i know computers existed well before 1997

input: Text: backstory- this happened maybe an hour ago. i'm new to weightlifting, but progressing quickly. i got sick twice back-to-back and then had finals week, then got my wisdom teeth taken out, so i haven't been to the weight room in a month or so. i get there, and start deadlifting. after a bit, this very fit, very beautiful girl starts deadlifting next to me. because i haven't been to the gym in a month, i'm pretty weak, and also, she's very strong. she's lifting the same as me, which is unacceptable. i must assert alpha-ness by lifting heavier things. so i keep piling the weights on, even though i'm weak from sickness and mouth surgery. maybe if i lift heavy enough things, she'll see me for the fine muscular specimen i (kinda) am. eventually, i lift to the point where i know she won't be able to match me. this is when i realize that legs feel very, very bad. i call it quits, and hobble to my car. i just got home, and i think my legs are done for the day. i can't really even walk normal.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: help me. i fucked up so bad. i don't know where i am. i don't know what is real and what is not. i think my computer and my phone is the only way i can communicate with the real world. fuck.

these were exactly my thoughts at the apex of my fuck up. 

i've never been a person to really use drugs or alcohol, but i decided to go on a hike with some friends where 7 (out of 8) of us decided to trip on shrooms. i've had my fair share with alcohol and weed, but i've always started out slow and built up a pretty good tolerance and gauge of my limits. this time however, i decided to start with 3 grams which supposedly is the regular dose (we found out later that the scale was broken and it was closer to 4 grams). for 5 of us, it was our first time. i took the lowest dose, with one of my friends taking 6 grams. 

we finally got to the beginning of the trail and we all ate our shrooms. the trail was about 1.3 miles long and we began walking. roughly 20 minutes in and my friends were beginning to trip, there was a nice waterfall or something at the end of the trail so we really wanted to make it; however, after half an hour or so we found a flat area where we decided we had to sit down.

until we sat down, i had felt little to nothing. then it hit me like a brick wall. almost immediately after sitting down, the ground beneath me starting moving. i've always been skeptical of hallucinogenics so i thought i was maybe just dehydrated from the heat. i drank water, and the trees started to move. i realized this shit was real, i was tripping. i saw light streaks, the trees moved like the optical illusion with leaves. i was feeling a lot of things at this time, just laughing a lot, it felt a little hard to breathe, but i was having a good time. the sky would turn from blue to green to purple and back to blue. i was just seeing crazy shit. this phase lasted from around 3pm to 5 pm. i was tripping balls but i still remember roughly what happened. after 5 pm...not so much.

the last thing i do remember between 5pm - 8pm is when my friends ask if we're ready to go. i think there's a general consensus of yes. 

i wake up in a car, with half of my friends. i think i've passed out for a long time. i check my phone...""8:30 pm"". i think to myself, there's no way i was out for only 3 hours. if i was, how the fuck am i in a car? the only possible solution? i was in a dream.

i vaguely remember my friends being hostile to me, but for no reason. constantly telling me to ""stop"" and then asking me if i was okay. it was scary, i didn't know what i did wrong. i remember trying to talk to get the attention of the sober member of my group, but not really sure why. i then remember being choke slammed into dirt by one of my friends. this really hurt in my mind. a lot. (apparently my friends told me later that i was trying to touch her hair and getting her to turn around and that resulted in me being slammed into the ground by my friend who took 6 grams.) at this point, the slamming, the hostility, it all felt unreal. it added to the idea that i was stuck in a dream world. i hadn't really woken up. i feel cuts on over my body and i feel a little sore, but i thought my mind was just compensating for when i got slammed in my dream.

i felt like it was really hard to move my body. i felt a cold breeze and it took almost 15 minutes to realize i wasn't wearing a shirt and i finally put it on. i looked at my friend, he was smoking from a bong. i saw the smoke come out and a couple seconds later i could smell the weed. it was a very weird disconnect between my senses. nothing felt right. they were still asking if i was okay from time to time but i couldn't really respond. they would occasionally say ""wooo! we made it."" i thought my mind was fabricating all of this. i was definitely not feeling okay, and these ""projections"" of my friends were trying to make me feel better.

i'm stuck in a car for over an hour, studying these projections, trying to figure out how i can tell they aren't real. i check my phone...no notifications, no messages, no phone call from my mom even though i've been passed out for what feels like probably a day (in reality i didn't remember what happened for 3 hours but i was awake). facebook seems like it didn't update since i checked it at lunch, it was just the same news feed. my mind was projecting this. i was in the car, afraid. i didn't know how to get out, where the car was, why i was with these 3 friends, why they were smoking. i was constantly touching the car around me. i was thinking that i should roll out of the car.

i felt powerless in the car and i decided maybe if i go to sleep i'll wake up for real. i remember thinking, holy shit the mind is so powerful, being able to fabricate all of this. i can live my world so differently, it's really what i believe is true is true. i don't really remember what happens in the car, probably because i decided to take a nap.

i finally get out of the fucking car. i feel a little better now. i remember my friend asking for my address, and as i get outside of the car, i see the in-n-out that's across my house. i'm thinking, of course. this is the easiest way my mind would recognize i'm home, of course i would fabricate it. 

i start running to my house and i try to open the door without keys. it's my mind fabricating this world right? i can unlock the door with my mind. nope. i can't open the door. i'm confused as fuck at this point. i check my pockets, my keys are gone. i didn't fabricate keys in my pocket? what the fuck am i doing? goddamn it. i start peering into my house, seeing if i can see my mom. i'm thinking maybe i should run through the window. i start to get scared again. i look at the streets with the cars flying by. i start to think about the easiest way to get out of this dream world. run onto the streets and get hit by a car? drive my own car and just speed into something? fortunately, i was too scared to do either. instead i constantly ask my friends for hugs. when i hug them, i feel body warmth. at this point i'm hoping i'm in the real world, but it doesn't feel like it. i'm desperately looking for things to help convince myself that i am in the real world. i start touching my friend's hair to see if it's real. 

the door opens. my mom is there. i was thinking holy shit, my mind finally opened the door. i'm not really convinced my mom is real. i say bye to my friends who dropped me off and walk straight to my room and get on the computer. for some reason, i felt that the internet would be the only way for me communicate with the real world. i looked up bad trips on shrooms but i couldn't find anything too similar to what i was feeling. i thought about posting on reddit that i was stuck, that i needed help and asap. i thought about calling the cops that i was stuck. i was in my room but i didn't feel at home at all.

i was still thinking of ways of how i had to die so i could wake up in the real world. am i in a coma right now? on a bed in the hospital? should i starve myself to death? what's the easiest way? or should i go with a fast way like getting hit by a car? this was some inception shit. oh fuck i'm like molly. what the fuck is real.

as i'm thinking of these ways to fix everything. i'm interrupted by a phone call from my best friend. i think to myself, holy shit. finally. someone in the real world that realizes i'm gone. i choose not to pick up, because i need to figure this out by myself. i don't want to freak out anyone in the real world. if i got a phone call from my best friend telling me that he's stuck in some dream world, i would think it's a joke. i didn't want to burden anyone else in this. i fucked up, it's my responsibility to fix all of this. two missed calls from my best friend. i start to think to myself, maybe i should let my phone die, so i don't have the temptation to communicate with the real world. what if i'm in a coma for months but my phone somehow is still working, that would freak everyone out. holy shit, this is how ghost stories work. fuckkkk. maybe it's like interstellar where i have to try and communicate with the real world.

my thoughts are interrupted by knocking at the door. my mom asks me who that is, and i respond with shrug. my best friend is suddenly at the door. i think to myself holy fuck my projections are on point. he's wearing the same clothes as i last saw him, meaning my brain is just using the last available information to reconstruct him. i wasn't sure if he was real or not, but i start freaking out in front of him and my mom. i tell him that i don't know what's real and that i'm really scared. like really scared. (he later tells me that i straight up asked if we did shrooms in front of my mom, lol). they both tell me to take a shower, listen to some happy music and go to sleep. i'm thinking to myself, of course i make my projections agree with each other. i tell them okay, go into the bathroom and completely break down.

i stare into the mirror and start crying. i repeat variations of ""i fucked up"" for a minute or so. i come back out and they're standing right there, and i pretend as if nothing happened. i grab my pj's and go take a shower. i see cuts and bruises on my ribs and think maybe that me getting slammed to the ground was actually real. as i'm taking a shower, i'm still thinking of the best ways to kill myself and get out of this dream world because this is too scary. i realize that i don't have my glasses and i've been wearing my contacts this entire time. just like my keys, my glasses are missing. at the time i thought, shit, my mind is getting tired, it can't fabricate everything. i can't keep this up. i have to do something.

i get out of the shower and decide i should probably look more into shrooms and their effects (something i should've done before i agreed to even take any). my phone starts ringing again, my best friend. what? he was just here...my mom is by me, probably because she notices that something isn't right. i still think my mom is a projection at this point, so i figured i might as well ask her if i should pick up my friend's phone call. she says yes, so after two missed calls, i pick up the phone. 

i couldn't hold my shit together. i don't remember exactly what went on during the phone call but i kept apologizing to my friend. i told him i'm so sorry that i fucked up so bad. i didn't know what was real and what wasn't. he tries to assure me that everything will be fine, and that we'll play volleyball tomorrow. i then told him that i was having a terrible trip, which he tells me that saying that in itself shows what kind of grasp i have on reality. this is probably the turning point in the night where i'm like oh shit. that makes sense. we laugh a little about that.

my mom tells me that there's food, i'm reluctant to eat because starving feels like a good way to die. i decide to test my mom, i ask her for a cup of water. i walk into my room and walk back into the dining area to see if a cup of water appears. okay, maybe she is real after all. i end up eating because i was hungry and wasn't too sleepy. 

i start to think back. i was in the car with those friends, and say not with my best friend was because we all live fairly close to each other, whereas my best friend lives a little further. i didn't have my keys and glasses because they were in my bag that i left in my friends car. everything begins to make more sense. 

i begin texting all my friends who were on that trip, to see if they would respond with something genuine. even my best friend, i texted him to see if i would get responses that my mind couldn't possibly fabricate. the texts between my friends and i gave me more and more assurance that i was actually in the real world all this time. i was still confused about some things as to how i got into the car, why i was choke slammed, all cut up etc, but i figured i would ask my friends tomorrow when i see them and i had a much better grasp now that i felt okay not knowing exactly what happened. my sober friend took videos and pictures of our trip (no pun intended) and i figured that it would answer all my questions. 

i go to sleep and that's pretty much the end of it because i wake up the next day completely fine, just still a little confused.

i still haven't asked my friends about all the details, because it's a little embarrassing and my sober friend hadn't brought up the fact that i tried to touch her hair (i had just heard from my other friends). i haven't seen the videos and i still need to apologize to her. i'm so grateful and surprised that my friends didn't freak out too when i was having a really bad trip. i love my friends, even the one that choke slammed me (i was really wishing this was actually a dream). i think that the hallucinations were made worse because i was probably dehydrated (i don't recall drinking water after 5 pm until i got home, and i lost my water bottle).

at the end of the day, i just wanted to say that definitely be careful of what you're putting into your body. i'm not going to tell you how to live your life but my advice with substances is not to go too hard the first time. i'm so grateful that nothing bad actually happened that day because i realize now that we could all have fallen off a cliff and died. this experience has made me feel so much more grateful for the people around me and the things that i have. i've never been more scared in my life, not knowing what is real and what isn't. it really isn't something you can entirely explain, and something you have to experience for yourself (hopefully you won't have to).

input: Text: so this happened about 20 min ago. i had gotten done with my quiet night of gaming and decided to take a shower before bed. as i was brining my dinner plate downstairs i noted my roommate was out and about. 

a little info: if i know my roommate is home, i will take my clothes into the shower with me and come out with at least pants on, out of courtesy for another person. if he is not home, i may or may not have boxers on, depending on how i feel. 

anyway, after drying off i open the door, and there are two girls standing outside his room, which happens to be directly adjacent to the bathroom. i was definitely not wearing pants, or boxers. aside from the brief awkwardness, i shrugged it off and walked to my room, down the hall a bit. 

i don't tend to get uncomfortable, as being in the military really prevents you from being shy. can't speak for them though, they seemed shocked for sure. 

 

edit: they're still here, so i'm hoping i didn't scare them off and my roommate can get some.

edit:i learned i should learn to be a human and put on a towel when walking out of the bathroom. but for my credit, i didn't expect anyone there!

edit: as absolutely crazy as this is gonna sound, i was not looking to hook up with either of them, because i had to get up early this morning for studying/homework, and just wanted to sleep. 

update: got a text this morning from roommate. apparently they found it hilarious, and a huge turn on. not sure what happened, as i passed out shortly after this post, but i'm assuming the best for him.

input: Text: so tonight, a sweet little girl rang my doorbell to sell me some chocolate almonds for her youth bowling club. i asked her how much it was and she said it was 3 dollars, so i quickly ran to my room and got 5 dollars for her, just so she would have an extra 2 dollars for her bowling club. i didn't realize until about 5 minutes later while opening the pack that she meant 3 dollars per pack, she gave me two packs which meant i actually owed her a dollar. i felt so fucking bad that i quickly got on my bike to look for them around my neighborhood, but it's pretty dark already so they're probably back home ;(

i feel like such an asshole, but i was trying to do something good. the packs came with the address and phone number of the bowling club though, i'm gonna stop by tomorrow and make things right. happy ending i guess!

short version: got into wrong car and drove for half an hour before realizing it wasn't mine.

input: Text: back in the 10th grade, i was a pretty dumbass kid. i was one of those people who were absolute nerds but were well-known throughout the whole school... that's being understated here.

it was that time where portable cd players were starting to become the norm for music, people had ridiculous clothing styles, and everything was pretty much better. popular music at that time consisted of girl group hip-hop and techno beats and love songs, one song in particular became sort of a chant within the vicinity of our school population. 

in early december a week or so before winter break was going to begin this song craze hit the school. the song at that point had hit #2 and everybody knew about it. so the faculty decided to ban the popular chorus from the song in order to try and restrict people from it, from what i heard it had to do with sexual innuedos or something.

nobody told me that they banned it.

so a few days before the break i was sitting at the nerd table and we were talking about the direction of music in the past few years. we agreed that the general quality of music was starting to go down, and i brought up the name of that song.

so the dean right by our table came up to me with a stern look on her face, wrote me a note and sent me right off to the principal's office. i got yelled at for about 20-30 minutes... it left me with a 2-day suspension. i pretty much kept my mouth shut until break began.

input: Text: one of my goals in life is to become a responsible adult. today, i thought i'd be a responsible adult by washing and folding the huge pile of sheets, towels, and linens that have been on the basement floor ever since my boyfriend and i moved into our new place.

the first load was in the dryer and the second load was in the washing machine when i spotted [this](http://imgur.com/flvt3mq) on the floor. 

""hey, that looks like a lock of my hair,"" i thought.

only later did i realize the true implications of what i saw.

half an hour later, i'm checking the first load of sheets out in the dryer when [this]( http://imgur.com/mnoa0lz) falls on the floor. 

apparently, at some point in the forgotten past, i had cut off my (long) ponytail and decided to tuck it away as some kind of memento. which is weird and kind of gross, i know, but now things were weirder and grosser: there was a fluffy four inch freshly laundered hairball on the ground in front of me, and everything in the dryer is covered in a thin layer of my old hair. hairy sheets, hairy pillowcases, hairy dishtowels...

the lint screen was an abomination: half fuzzy, half hairy, like the untimely doom of some kind of terrible little creature. the inside of the dryer was also coated in hot, dry, staticky hair. 

 i cleaned off as much as i could. some of the sheets shook it off easily, but the terry cloth towels and flannel pillowcases are still noticeably hairy. i ran two more loads of laundry, and cleaned more hair out of the dryer each time.

i'm rewashing the hairier things tonight. hopefully that will get rid of most of it  but if it doesn't? 

am i going to have to confess to my boyfriend that his girlfriend is a weird hair-hoarding freak? or will he just get more and more confused when his socks and boxers start come out of the dryer covered in thin layers of blond hair?

at one point he started forcing my head which usually i like, but with the bad angle i was gagging every time so i pulled away... thought he would get the signal.  a few minutes later he tries again and i felt the wave coming.  i kept my mouth wrapped around and swallowed it at least, but i could taste the fucking garlic bread i had at dinner.

needless to say, the blow job ended there.  i am way less grossed out that i barfed on his dick and hardly embarrassed at all (we have been together a long time), but just totally disgusted that i swallowed my own fucking barf.

now driving home, the wad of paper pressed against my crotch became very uncomfortable, and really started up a crazy storm of debilitating cramps, and i can hardly believe i made it home alive. luckily, i was able to go home and shower, and my pants were safe.

i work at a small business in a small town in nw louisiana. we sell outdoor power equipment (lawnmowers, string trimmers, leaf blowers, etc.). i had a customer come in monday that was looking at a lawnmower. i was pretty sure he would buy but he wanted to, ""talk to the wife""...sales code for, ""eh...i'll pass."" anyway he calls back today and asks about an extended service plan the manufacturer offers. i have only been at this job for a month so i wasn't aware of this service plan. i say i'll look into it and he agrees. he says he will come in later and we'll discuss it then. 

fast forward to this afternoon. boss has been gone all day on a sales call (we also sell fireplaces so he was setting up an install) so i didn't have a chance to ask him. keep in mind this is a really small small business. like 6 employees. the guy i run the place with had no clue about this service plan. anyway, the customer comes in and we're discussing the lawnmower. i'm 99% sure he's going to buy so we're at my desk. he asks about the service plan and i again say i'm unfamiliar. he says it is on the manufacturer's website. the manufacturer is a company called hustler. i turn my monitor to the customer so we can both see and put www.hustler.com in the address bar. bam. brazilian chick getting railed in the pooper. awkward silence. 

i had another manufacturer's website open on another tab because i was putting in a big order when he came in so i couldn't just x out of the main window. it felt like it took an hour to find the x on the hustler tab but i finally hit it and went to the correct website, www.hustlerturf.com. 

the customer was a good sport about it in the end and ended up buying the mower. we laughed it off but the awkward moment still existed.

so, in pre-ap we had an athens-sparta debate (go sparta), and during the debate, the athenians said that ""making technology for war causes more war"" so i respond by saying ""really? ever since ww2, there have been no wars -- (i get cut off here) the class is now flipping shit, calling me retarded, autistic, and stupid. the teacher tries to now explain to me how there have been multiple wars since ww2. i know this. i'm not a dumbfuck. i was trying to say there had been no wars using nuclear weapons since ww2. i know this quite well. my family has fought in every single one of those wars. but seriously? why not let me finish my fucking sentence? 

so after she lets me finish, half of my class tells me to leave, the other half to go back to athens, and then the teacher is still calling me stupid.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i was sleeping in from a really late night of studying. i had two  finals in less than 3 hours. i checked my phone and i noticed my friend sent me a snapchat of a really tiny kitten. i saw something was wrong because it was sitting in the middle of a parking lot and wasn't moving much. it looked to be about 2-3 weeks old. i knew she wouldn't do anything about it because she's not an animal person, so i had to get over there and check the situation out. 
when i got there, my heart dropped. it was frail, sickly, and all alone. it was way too young to have walked there by itself, so i'm assuming it's mother moved it. 
this is where i faced my moral dilemma. 
should i save the kitten? i really don't have time for this. i need to get to the library and cram for my final exams. i'm wasting time just by being here. 
i have rescued strays before and know it takes a lot of time and effort. this one in particular needed medical attention. 

eventually, i decided to take it with me because i knew if i left it in the parking lot, it would be run over or a hawk would eat it. the sky also looked like it was going to rain heavily as well. 

i was soo happy to have a kitten. i love kittens so much, but i don't have one due to financial reasons. but now, i have a job lined up and i'll definitely have the resources available to raise one. 

it was soo cute and when it got into my car, it seemed to perk up a bit. it meowing and crawling around. it's life didn't seem in such dire need at that point.  however, it looked like it would be old enough to walk, but it was just crawling instead. i knew it needed a vet immediately. 
i went to my computer and looked up some places. no one was answering their phone! i must have called 4 places and this is a small college town.  i was pretty upset at this point. stressing that i'm not studying and i have to take care of a young kitten. i noticed it smelled really bad. it's mother wasn't properly cleaning it, which may have caused her to leave it in the parking lot. i suspected some type of internal problem. 

i made the decision of waiting until after i was done with my finals today to start feeding it. that would be about 5-6 hours and i really thought it could make it until then. my mom has experience taking care of young kittens and bottle feeding them, so i wanted to take it to her to raise.  i was going to take it to the vet's office as soon as finished my finals.

unfortunately, by the time i got home, it was dead. 

i was so angry. i was soooo upset that the one day in the entire year that i have two final exams is also the same day that i found it. any other day, i would have been able to work around. it was the worst timing ever. i really wish i had just gone to a vet's office and left it there. i feel like such a failure and a disappointment to myself. 
i can't even enjoy my graduation at this point. all i can think about is what i should have done to save this cat's life. it was so young....

if anything, i learned some valuable lessons from this experience.

at about 1am i wake up and am suddenly wide awake, then i hear someone cough downstairs. i'm suddenly convinced that a) i forgot to lock the back door and b) therefore someone is in the house.

instead of acting like a sane person, i decide that, as a reasonably scary looking guy, i should grab some larp gear and scare this fucker out of my house. of the stuff that was lying about i grab a reasonably realistic looking foam axe and a ram's skull, and head downstairs to confront whoever it is and scare them the fuck out of my house.

end result, i turn on all the lights realise that i locked all the doors. i then wake up enough to remember that a) i live in an end terrace house, it was probably my neighbours and b) i'm now wondering around the house at 1am in the buff holding an axe and a ram's skull. i'm glad there's nobody actually about to see this and try to go back to sleep.

not a fu of the kind of magnitude usually seen here, but hopefully that'll entertain some people.

turns out, she had gotten pregnant and we weren't entirely sure who's it was as there was a week between my last hookup with her and his first. since we couldn't exactly keep it secret from family until the baby was born and we couldn't do a paternity test we just decided he would say it was his, since we figured that was most likely anyway. after he was born we secretly did the test and found out he is, in fact, mine. him and the mom got married a year later and i am very close to them so i get to be a big part of the kids life.


my son has found out about the whole 23andme thing and purchased the genetic testing kit. i had done it about a year ago when they still had the medical screening part, now that he has submitted his i'm worried what will happen if his results come up showing his father in the relatives, when my brother hasn't taken the test. does anybody know if that is a possibility? i don't really know how the kid will take it or how we could explain this to a 9 year old.

i am in dubai and after a tiring day of competition and sightseeing, i am on my hotel bed and trying to sleep. but i couldn't. i open my laptop and type xvideos. porn in blocked! not in the hotel, throughout the city. zenmate is not establishing a secure server for some reason. the level of surveillance in dubai scares me. 

now earlier that day i overheard a couple in the elevator. they sounded obviously british. i knew their room number (hotel bill in hand). so i 'forget' logged in wifi. log in again. type their room number - 18010. it asked for surname. i type a bunch of generic british surnames i can think of. clarkson. hammond. cameron. brown. blair. adams. it was baldwin. i felt so sherlock for observing my surroundings. i use fillterbypass.me and start browsing on xvideos. i browsed through some weird weird weird stuff (for 20 minutes or so) before finding the perfect video of shazia sahari.

at breakfast next morning, i proudly tell my partner (in competition) the shit i pulled off last night. we laugh. we're in the elevator, going back to our room from the downstairs restaurant, when two cops walk in and press 18. my partner stares at me terrified. we get off on our floor (14) and make pact to never speak of it again.

input: Text: i was on my way to bring in the trash cans this afternoon when i saw a dust ball like figuring moving on the road. it came towards me and ran away towards my neighbor. my neighbors cat was on the road and ignored the dust ball. as i kept surveying it, the dust like figure moved further up the road and attempted to enter my garden again. 

i stopped it the second time with my presence and it went down the street. it traveled under one of my recycling bins and without thinking i rolled over one of it's hands and it made a loud squeal. 

lying on my front lawn, was a mole that just screamed at the top of its lungs and not moving. the cat finally comes over and sniffs the mole and leaves! i have left incriminating evidence of my assault towards a defenseless animal on my lawn and do not know what the neighbors will think of it. to quickly hide the evidence, i scooped the mole up with a shovel into a bucket and brought it to my backyard. 

the mole was disoriented for about 20 minutes and started acting lively again. it is still injured though and if i were to release it, the mole might just come back to my garden again. 

i started to look up what i could feed the mole for the time being, and realized it eats nothing but worms and larvae. i also found out, a mole cannot remain without food for 24 hours or it will die!

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this actually happened around four years ago.

at the time i was studying on exchange in a small german coastal town. needless to say, it was a long way away from my hometown in sydney. so one day my german roommates took pity on me and decided to buy me a box of unopened (with shells) macadamia nuts to remind me of home. 

fast forward a week later and am at my desk trying to write an essay on jane austen out of all things and naturally i'm bored to tears. i've got no smokes left so i'm scanning my desk for something to do and awesome! i spot my macadamia nuts that i had forgotten about. i couldn't be bothered walking to the kitchen so smart-as fuck me decides that the best option is the pair of scissors that i have in my room. sweet! 

i grip the macadamia with my thumb and index finger and then use the scissors to hit and jab at the nut, thinking that it will cause it to break open. 

it all goes to shit when with one hit i miss the nut, and manage to not only hit the main nerves in my thumb but also break off the main tendon for my thumb as well. mayhem ensues. i can't move my index finger and thumb, i let out a bloodcurdling scream before i go into shock, german roommates rush in, are all efficient as one of them grabs ice and the other rushes me to the hospital in her car. 

this is at around 11:30pm and the doctor in the er tells me that they have to quickly do a surgery on my hand to re-tie the tendon and to repair the nerves. they call in one of their best hand doctors (wtf are they called) along with a plastic surgeon and then nonchalantly tell me that the surgery would cost 16,000 euros. lol wtf, umm. 

'do you have insurance?'

'i think my australian uni is covering my insurance during my time on exchange?'

'ok. we will call them' (side note: the doctor is hot as fuck here and i realise that i haven't shaved my legs)

'ok, our administrators called them. yes, you are covered. you will not pay anything. your surgery is at 6am tomorrow, you will sleep here.'

the next morning the surgery goes well, i vomit a shitload of anaesthesia out, and then i spend the next 6 months relearning how to use my thumb. 

the next christmas i think that i'm gifted a million nutcrackers. oh, and i totally passed that jane austen essay. 

 

for those curious, here are old photos of my thumb progress: http://i.imgur.com/g3jvywy.jpghttp://i.imgur.com/6tz9hw6.jpg

input: Text: note: this didn't actually happen today. it occurred awhile ago before i even discovered reddit.

the date was june 11, 2013. i was in my room on the second floor of my house talking with a few of my friends. we we're discussing the different action movies we had seen since being released from school in may. 

after a good hour or so of rambling on about all of the ridiculous stunts in the movies my friend brought up a very particular, and cliched, stunt. 

this was, of course, the stunt where the hero jumps out of the window and lands on the ground without suffering injuries from the glass or the fall.

being the jokester of the group i commented that i could probably preform that stunt 'in my sleep'. to which my friend replied, ""alright then, hot wheels. how about you demonstrate it for us then?""

being also the dumbass of the group (hence why i'm here), i took him up on his offer. i got up, backed up against the wall, and ran full speed through the window. 

that's where i fucked up.

not only did i cut my arms and face on the glass, but i also fell face first onto the hood of my father's white volkswagen.

might i add that it hurt like hell.

i was taken to the hospital where i learned that i had broken my left arm and received a concussion from impacting the car. oh, and don't forget countless cuts that required stitches.

what did i learn from this? to leave stunts to the professional idiots...

...and that my father's car was covered in bird shit.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: **backstory:** this was about three years ago and recently something brought this back to the surface of my mind. at this time i was a 21 year old male and my friend at the time was a 22 year old female who we will call 'summer'. in a very short amount of time we became extremely close and i did fall for her. after doing something very stupid to her we never spoke again. until yesterday.

**real story:**so on this particular day everything was right in the world. it was about noonish and we were supposed to go hang out and do whatever it was we did. or in this case didn't wind up doing. i went over to her house to pick her up(as planned, no surprise visit or anything) and she answered her door still in pajamas. she explained that she just got out of the shower so she still needed to put on actual clothes for going out.

okay, cool. no big deal. she gave me a hug and asked me to wait. she is a small person and was wearing a zipup hoodie 2 sizes too big for her. it wasn't exactly zipped up all the way and she's shorter than me. so inadvertently i wound up looking at her breast since she didn't have bra on. she did not notice that i saw and that's when i began my fuck up. 

instead of just taking a mental snapshot and waiting on the bed(this was a studio type of apartment) i decided it would be a great opportunity to *flirt*. i believe my words were ""huh...those are really nice."" she was a bit confused at first until she realized what i was talking about and where i was looking. she started blushing profusely and didn't look at me. she didn't say anything and just stood there really embarrassed. 

i realized that it probably wasn't a smart thing so i apologized right there on the spot. she still didn't say anything or look at me. she's always been a shy type of person and self conscious about herself. *i* in my stupidly young mind couldn't quite figure out what to do next. and then it hit me. and this is where it all went to hell.

i wanted to fix her embarrassment by embarrassing myself. my dumb idiot self thought it was a fantastic idea to drop my pants and pull down my boxers and shout ""hey look at me! it's fine summer! now you've seen me and i'm not comfortable with this either!!!"" and some other nonsense like that.

she briefly looked and all the blood drained from her face. there wasn't anymore blushing or anything like that. she just stood there white as a ghost. summer walked over to the bed and laid down in the fetal position hugging herself. i have never witnessed a sadder sight. and it was even worse to know that i was the cause of it.

i pulled my pants back up and started to call her name but she told me to stop talking. i walked towards her and it was told ""don't"". so i did exactly that and froze in my tracks. i really didn't know what to do at this point. i thought it was supposed to be kinda funny and at the most just get slapped. i apologized some more and asked her if she wanted me to leave. she was still laying there and began to cry. summer never looked at me and she stopped answering. i took that as an understandably sign to get the fuck out of her house.

the next day i tried to call but she didn't answer. i texted her apologies using as many synonyms for the word that i could find in a thesaurus. i tried a few more times over the course of a few weeks and one day she did say that it was ""okay"". even still we never hung out or spoke again after that.

i never regretted a moment in my life and much as that one. i not only lost what i felt was my best friend but i did it by making her cry. i disgusted her beyond belief and i can't even fathom what the hell made me think that was a good idea in the first place. it wasn't funny as i was expecting and instead was just depressing. i was the cause of it.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: quick background: i've had insomnia issues for years and went the prescription route about six months ago. tried a thousand options, all unsuccessfully, and finally struck gold with ambien. i take 10mg pretty much every night - total godsend. recently started dating a new guy. he's great, i'm infatuated, and i'm doing everything in my power to not fuck it up.


as most of you probably know, the ambien walrus is very real. if you don't go to bed within 20-30 minutes, you'll probably start seeing and doing weird shit. most nights i'm asleep in minutes, but i've never had insane hallucinations or blacked out and done something ridiculous. i've watched pillows growl like lions, picture frames morph into dragons, and towels turn into the couple from american gothic. the worst thing thus far was waking up to an order confirmation from amazon prime for 24 boxes of sugar-free jello.


well, that is until 3:30 am today. last night was our second adult sleepover. around 3, he's sound asleep and starting to snore a little while i'm lying there under his cuddle trap, bug-eyed and wide awake. i'd had a long week and the idea of a sleepless night isn't too appealing, so i grab one from my purse, swallow the fucker, and crawl back into bed. we didn't have much to drink earlier and the ambien walrus rarely hangs out with me, so i wasn't worried about anything.


about 15 minutes later, the bf wakes up and starts initiating sex, and i'm very down. he's hot, sex is fun, and let's just say 2015 was the most celibate year of my adult life. everything's going great - a little making out, a little foreplay, the p goes in the v, everyone's happy. important to note: we aren't doing anything remotely freaky. very enjoyable, but very vanilla.


at this point, it's right around the 30 minute mark and just in time, the walrus pulls a michael jordan and comes out of retirement. the bf's been on top for a few minutes when i suddenly recoil a little. out of nowhere i scream, ""oh my god stop. can't we just have sex normally?!"" he pulls off and says, ""i'm sorry, of course...but what do you mean? did i do something wrong?"" 


i was 100% convinced that we were having sex on stage at the democratic national convention while hillary clinton was delivering a speech. i thought his bed was next to the podium, and hil was narrating our every move and explaining how real sex, aka not porn sex, works as part of some sex ed thing. he's howling laughing, can barely breathe, rolls off of me and tells me that sure, we can leave, we'll just go to sleep and have some normal sex later.


i wake up at 9-ish and as a huge fan of morning nookie, i'm all over him. right as he's about to stick his dick in me, he smirks and goes, ""oh i'm sorry, is this normal enough for you?"" i don't have a fucking clue what he's talking about. he starts cracking up and explains the entire thing, which i had zero recollection of (though it's been coming back to me today). i don't think i've ever been more embarrassed or turned a brighter shade of red in my life.


the bad news is, i don't think i can take ambien again. ever. i want to flush my remaining supply down the toilet and tell my doctor to cancel my refills and get me on something new. the good news is, this guy must be quite fond of me, because i'm pretty sure yelling that you don't want to fuck on stage at the democratic national convention would be a dealbreaker for most people. ^don't^worry^we^still^boned^after


oh, and i'm not even a democrat. and i really don't like hillary clinton.

input: Text: so 1 week ago, i was on my laptop browsing reddit, and i got thirsty. i got a 2l water bottle and just put it on the table next to my laptop. what i didn't know is that the water bottle was cracked, or unbalanced, not sure how to put it, so basically the second i put the bottle on the table, it tilted towards the right side and fell, right on top of my brother's unprotected glasses, so they are a little dented but idk how damaged they really are. expecting lots of yelling either way.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened an hour ago. at around 8:50pm i realised i didn't get my paychecks yet, so i asked one of the employees, australian by the way, to get them. she came back and gave me $400 worth. 

here's where the f.u. happened. i loosely tucked the paychecks into a sleeve in my apron (i work as a courtesy clerk) and went on the rest of my shift. apparently, i was so zoned out that i didn't notice that all the paychecks, at some point, just fell out of the sleeve. i clocked out at 9:15, folded up my apron, and ran home (i don't own a car). it wasn't until i settled down at home 30 minutes later that i finally realised the checks were gone.

i panicked like crazy, dropping lots of sweat and mumbling in a very worrying tone. i decided to go back to the store through the fastest way possible: my little brother's bike. upon arriving, i asked all the employees if they saw anything; each said no. the head clerk then said to wait until tomorrow to tell the manager what happened, and he will be able to reprint the checks. i got home another 20 minutes later disappointed but relieved. all my mother had to say was, ""well, i hope you learned a very important lesson in responsibility.""

let's see what happens tomorrow.

*not a big f.u., but it's one that made me very flustered.*

**edit 1:** i finally called up the manager at around 8:00 today, as the head clerk told me. after 10 minutes of being on hold listening to some ambient jungle music, the manager picked up. i told him what happened. and the first thing he said was, ""i'm not the one in charge of checks."" he then said i had to call up another department if i ever had this problem, but they're closed on the weekends. so now, i'll have to wait until monday to get the checks renewed. fml?

input: Text: so thursday i was taking a test for my english class. now this test was an interesting one because of what it was over. the test was on an outside of class reading book, basically we had to do a short answer writing assignments for a test grade. i read catch-22 which is a great novel, i highly recommend it. however, despite my normally being a good student, i am struggling in this class. the teacher hates me and thinks i am a slacker who doesn't try because i have accommodations. i have some adhd and dislexia so i get a few little aids like time and a half on tests and the ability to type my papers instead of hand writing them. this doesn't give me an excuse, in fact i have to work harder than others to reach my full potential. 

so, there i am the morning of the test an i am freaking out. i'm under a lot of pressure because i am trying to get my grade up in that class to get an academic scholarship. since i'm nervous i decide to cram using sparknotes and wikipedia. unfortunately, i got distracted and moved to another tab without closing the wiki links. now when i went to type my test those tabs were still open but i opened my word processor from a reddit tab and didn't notice. i type my test and everything is going swimmingly, until my teacher decided to monitor my chrome book i was typing on. it is the schools chromebook so there is a program that my teacher can access a listing of what tabs i have open. now those tabs of wikipedia and sparknotes are still open and my teacher sees those. boom  instant failure. written up for cheating. in school suspension. 0 on the test. no exam exemptions.  this has screwed my chances of getting into my dream college and i will lose my scholarships at my safety school. i fucked up boys, and i don't know what to do.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so it was summer vacation and my friend and i were staying at another friend's house while he was in new york for the summer. his parents owned the place and were relatively wealthy. they also worked in lived and worked in holland at the time. when my friend and i moved into his house he mentioned that we could have any of the alcohol that he left behind. throughout the summer went went through quite a few bottles of vodka, rum etc. we had a good time. 

one day, whilst snooping around we found a hidden cabinet in the bathroom way up high. after standing on a chair, i found a few bottles of bright green alcohol. there was a grey goose bottle, a sapphire bottle, and various others all filled with this same green. 

our immediate thought:  omg... absinthe (at least the hard stuff with real wormwood) is illegal in the us. these guys live in holland. it's hidden away. it's in different bottles so it won't be suspicious. holy shit we just found a shit ton of absinthe. 

we spent the next hour or so debating what to do. do we drink it? as people who don't do any drugs, we were pretty nervous about the potential hallucinations we might have... but eventually we gave in and thought we'd drink some. 

we each took a shot. we waited. ""do you feel anything yet?"" was a constant question we asked. 

we took a few more shots. after all, one shot isn't gonna do anything. after about six shots a piece we became skeptical. we finally gave in and texted our friend to ask about the absinthe in his cabinet... who knows... maybe we were drinking it wrong. 

he said we'd have to specify about the bottle so we sent him this picture:

http://imgur.com/bljcrjk

he responded, and it turns out that we had been taking shots of highlighter ink that he would display under backlights for backlight parties.
we freaked out obviously and called poison control. they basically told us to piss a lot and not sleep till we thought it was out of our systems.

so my family decided to holiday on the remote scottish island of uist a few years ago.
my dad and i were having a play fight (as you do) and i pushed him onto the arm of a rigid leather sofa and then proceeded to body slam him with all my weight.
what followed was the crack of 2 of his ribs breaking (i felt it travel through my body, like when someone farts on the couch next to you and you can feel it vibrating).
my poor dad then fell to the floor gasping for breath as i stood speechless, looking down at him in horror.
it was at this moment that my brother (who hadn't heard/felt the bones break) mistook my dads gasping for laughing and jumped on his head.

just to make matters worse he's a doctor so he didn't think he should be bothering emergency services with something he could treat himself.
all night i could hear him groaning and gasping in pain and i've never felt so bad in my life though i'm fairly sure he felt worse.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i wouldn't really say it's much of a fuck up since i never see people do this but i still consider it to be a normal. least that's what my parents taught me. first post on reddit btw.

i was going home on the 6 train in nyc headed towrds pelham bay and i get on the train and find a nice seat. a few stops later i notice a bunch of somewhat old people getting on the train. they weren't handicapped nor had a cain or any disabilities from what i first noticed. 

a lady, i'd say around 60 years old entered the train with a pully bag (idk the proper name), she looked around and just stood near the door. i didn't think anything of it. i finished eating my lunch (a samosa chaat, if you were curious) and just closed my eyes listening to lindsey stirling. 

a few stops later i looked to see what stop the train was on and the same lady was standing in the same spot. the lady was looking around the train and her eyes were red and she looked like she was crying a little. she was shaking a little but i didn't think much of it.

after a few stops, the train was much more crowded now with little room. the train stopped on 110th. someone got off and the lady was on her way there but some asshole rushed passed her and sat down. she looked hurt and disappointed. i began thinking what should i do. i mean i knew i should have immediately offered my seat but i didn't. i didn't know why either. the lady now was tearing up. 

the train cleared up a little and i finally noticed her knees shaking a little. i then immediately got up and gave her my seat and she said thank you. i feel like i should have noticed it much earlier. normally i'm much more observant but waking up at 5:30 in the morning to get to an 8am class is tiring but it's no excuse for my fuck up. i got off the train at parkchester which is like maybe a 40 minute ride from where the lady originally got on and she was still on the train. i guess she was headed further uptown. but regardless, i don't know if this qualifies for a tifu but it just left me with a nasty feeling knowing i could have offered myself earlier. just felt like a fuck up to me.

input: Text: so this happened about a year ago when i was working at a creamery that made cheese and ice cream. now i don't want to say the name of the company but they sell cheddar throughout the u.s.

so i worked graveyard which was just 4 guys. 2 guys making the cheese and 2 guys cleaning and no supervisor . there was 1 guy running the cooking vats and one guy running the whey and milk presses and we'd switch every couple hours


now we have very strict time schedules that we try to adhere to and when it was my turn on the vats i noticed we were about a minute or so behind. so i remembered in my training that if we were that far behind we could speed up the pumps that pump the cheese curd into the cheddaring machine. so i sped the pump up from about 30 percent to about 70 percent for 1 vat and set it back. made up the time loss and then some so i was happy with what i had done.

fast forward to about an hour later i was coming back from break and saw the guys running around in a panic. apparently the cheese that got pumped out faster all got clogged up about halfway through the cheddaring machine. nobody noticed until about 2 more vats worth of cheese had also been pumped behind it.

so we had to call in the boss and wake him up to come down while we stopped production and tried to manually cut the cheese out of the machine through little windows. 

because of the stop in production we had to pasteurize( instead of heat shock as we normally would) about 4 vats worth of cheese which makes it a lot less valuable. plus we were unable to make as much cheese throughout the day, putting the estimated loss at around $100,000.

luckily i didn't get in any trouble since my trainer had taught me to speed it up( although i sped it up a lot higher than i should've)

i looked down at my foot in shock, i couldn't believe a knife had the audacity to interrupt my honey bun time. luckily the knife bounced out after it landed sharp end down on my foot. the next logical step was to find my honey bun and proceed to the toilet (since i also had to pee). while eating my honey bun and staring at my bleeding foot, i came up with what i believe to be a brilliant idea, at the time. i decided to put two socks on my damaged foot, to help stop the bleeding, i recognized the importance that two socks on one foot would provide absorbency and pressure. after applying the two socks, i finished eating and peeing, and went back to sleep.

input: Text: my father in law has been over at the house lately helping me with a little project in the backyard. we realized today that we needed a couple of bolts and washers from lowes to complete the project, so we decided to take my car and head over there so that we could wrap up the job.

as we are walking to my car my father in law starts to ask me if i have sirius satellite radio hooked up. he's thinking about getting it activated in his car since his trial ran out so he's questioning me on what channels i listen to. i tell him about bbc radio (he's originally from the uk) and he's quite excited to hear that its a channel option. i listen to bbc radio all the time so the channel is pretty much permanently on. 

so we hop into my car and i start it and begin to back out of the garage. i have a newer volkswagen so the stereo has a large push button screen that allows you to select radio stations. the radio station screen with all the stations listed disappears when you put the car into reverse because the image from the reverse camera then takes over the display.

just as we are backing out of the garage i hear the words '...birth control' over the radio, but somewhat quiet. i proceed to turn up the volume because i assume that the radio is still tuned to the bbc and they are talking about some new pubic healthcare issue or some such thing. 
the next words i hear just after i turn up the radio, and much louder this time, is:

'aaaahhh...i just shot a huge load into your pu**y'

what the hell!?

i frantically try to switch the radio station but the god damned backup camera is on the screen showing where i am going, and it won't allow me to change the radio stations! im trying to act casual here, but its pretty clear at this point that my father in law heard what was going on and can see that i am frantically trying to change the station. then comes the next words from the radio..

<fart noise> 'oh yeah baby push it out of there! i love that sound. fart my cum right out of your pu**y'

fml... is this for real?

finally i remember there is a 'band' button physically on front of the radio so that i can switch between am/fm and i start pushing the damned thing fast. finally the f*cking porno sounds end and some song comes up.

i've stopped the car half way out of my driveway at this point because i have put so much attention on this damned radio. i can't believe i panicked so much that i didn't just hit the stupid power button or band button earlier. what the hell was i thinking?

a few seconds of silence pass and then my father in law finally says 'what exactly did we need again? some bolts and washers right?' 
a nice attempt on his part, but i was as red as a tomato at this point and my shame was everywhere. we drove the rest of the way in relative silence, minus the bbc radio that i was finally able to put on. 

what happened you ask? well my stupid fucking radio has a bluetooth function which allows you to stream audio from your phone over the speakers. its nice because you can listen to your music/audiobooks/whatever from your phone over the car speakers. 

well the last time i had gotten out of the car the radio was set to this bluetooth mode because i had been listening to an audiobook on the way home from work. well shortly after i had gotten home from work that night, i decided to check out pornhub on my phone and watch a few 'tasteful' videos.

because the porn video was the last thing that i had looked at on my phone before i had gotten into the car, the sound from that porn was broadcast through my car speakers as soon as the car turned on. turning on the car essentially unpaused that fucking video and proceeded to play the rest of the audio through my car speakers. 

we finished the job and my father in law pretended like it never happened. i appreciate that. but this will always go down as one of the worst things that has ever happened to me.

input: Text: like most tifu's, this did not occur today.

in a former life i was a nightclub manager in the heart of sydney. locals will know it as the infamous 'lockout' district. i dealt with the local police on an almost nightly basis and was on a first name basis with most of the licensing unit (the cops assigned to bars and clubs specifically).

on this fateful monday venue management is having our weekly catch up with marketing. marketing lets us know they have booked an event aimed at gay middle eastern men. cool, new crowd, new revenue stream and it fills a big hole in the event calendar.

marketing does let us know that the guy running this event (commonly called a promoter) is experienced, professional but personality wise is somewhat erratic and prone to over-reacting to small things. not a problem, we've dealt with far worse.

so wednesday rolls around and marketing texts me that there's an issue: threats have been made against this event. the promoter is really worried - apparently he's pretty sure he knows who issued the threats (but has no proof) and is concerned for the safety of staff and the patrons.

his prediction is the the person making the threats will send in a 3rd party, unknown to anyone there, who will play nice with security to get in the door and only cause trouble once the event is in full swing. big fucking knives on a crowded, dark, loud dance floor kind of trouble.

so i contact local police and let them know the situation. given we only have vague threats and no proof at this point we ask for a uniformed presence to be in the area to deter any troublemakers, as well as be nearby if the shit does hit the fan.

7.30 friday rolls around, doors open at 8. as i'm setting up the door i notice not only a uniformed presence, but groups of 4-5 police every 200 meters or so, just roaming the street. seems like overkill for one potential troublemaker, but it's not uncommon to see a lot of uniforms out if there's a footy game or festival or other  big event with a large number of people heading into town after to kick on.

it's at this point i personally meet the promoter for the first time. he's not 'slightly erratic' as marketing warned, he's a fucking jittery whirlwind who talks a mile a minute and squirrel is very easily squirrel distracted. we shake hands, chat about the plans for the night and i give him a final run down of a few house rules and legal requirements we have to abide by.

it's at this point the aforementioned licensing cops roll up, which is good timing because i was about to go over the threats made and their exact nature with the jittery whirlwind. so i introduce him to officers 1, 2 and 3 and ask him to go over exactly what's been said by who.

he begins by saying the threats were made on facebook and he has screenshots. he pulls out his tablet to show us.

>see here, here and here? i don't know this guy but the profile picture is someone else i know and he's been all over the event page telling me he's going to get it shut down. that's a threat. we've been threatened. i'm really worried about this, i don't want anyone getting stabbed by this psycho or his hit-men.

we all just stop and stare. you see, this kind of shit is really, really common. it's usually a rival event or promoter trying to sabotage their competition. the oldest, dirtiest trick in the book is to call the cops, tell them the headlining dj or band is a drug dealer or carrying a gun or whatever. said entertainer gets detained, sometimes for an extended period, which essentially kills the event. officer 1 looks me in the eye. officer 2 is dumbfounded. officer 3 breaks the silence.

>you're telling me this is all over some facebook bullshit? we've pulled in officers from other parts of town for this!

it's then that i realize all those cops i saw aren't out for a footy game or a festival crowd, they're out because this crazy son of a bitch said his *gay middle eastern* event had received threats. post 9/11. and because i was a known entity to local police and they know i'm not a fucking idiot they took it fairly seriously.

officer 1 looks me in the eye again and motions me to one side to speak privately. as i'm walking off i hear officers 2 and 3 berating this idiot for wasting their time.

i *immediately* begin apologizing. i had no idea. he said there were knives and hit-men involved. he never told me, or marketing, that this was facebook bullshit. he just said they'd been threatened.

officer 1 shakes his head, takes a few steps away and gets on his radio. within 20 minutes there's not a cop to be seen.

i find out the following week, via a phone call from the venues owner, who was on holiday and none too pleased to be dealing with this bullshit, that my call had in fact met the criteria for a low level terror alert, and in the future i'd better be real fucking sure i do my due diligence and investigate any 'threats' made before calling the police.

input: Text: &nbsp;  
(like all tifus, t=""that time when"" not ""today."")  back in the late 80s, i was a repair tech for a computer manufacturer.  a lot of maintenance had to be done in the wee hours because i worked on production systems that ran entire businesses.  i had to upgrade a system, but wasn't allowed to take it offline until 3am.  i got to the data center around midnight, though.  so i was pretty bored.  at the time, computers were huge, and most were encased in large fridge-sized (or bigger) enclosures.  ""skins,"" we called them.  today everything is in standard 19"" rack enclosures.  
so to amuse myself and pass the time, i went around the data center and peered into other systems.  many of them had a sort of lever-style handle that opened them up, so when i came to a really large handle on a system that was set up against the wall, i didn't really pay attention to anything else.  
i pulled the lever, thinking it would open and i'd see whatever was inside.  nope.  it turned off all the things.  the data center went dark.  the emergency lighting came on.  and i heard the sound of hundreds of fans, disk drives, high-speed printers, tape drives, etc. whirring down all at once.  it was like that scene in star wars where obi wan kenobi powers down the death star's tractor beams.  
peering up in the dim emergency lighting, i read the words ""ups power cut off"" (or something like).  a ups is an uninterruptible power supply.  it keeps power going to a system or a place in the event of a blackout.  in a data center, they sometimes use really big ones, with the temporary power provided by of lead/acid batteries.  lots and lots of 'em.  i realized had just cut power to the entire data center.  
i can only describe the sensation i felt by saying that it was like someone had replaced all the blood in my body with liquid nitrogen.  i couldn't breathe.  my vision narrowed until i could only see a small spot in front of me.  i was screwed.  
i tried pulling the handle/lever back to its original position, but only a few systems started coming up.  in my panic, i thought maybe another power cycle would help.  so i threw the switch off again, then back on.  even fewer systems booted up.  so i did it again.  and again.  and then finally the ups wouldn't provide power anymore, and i smelled burning insulation somewhere in one of the battery enclosures.  double screwed.  
being a basically good person and wanting to take responsibility, i immediately phoned my customer contact and confessed what i had done.  except not really.  
instead, i got out a flashlight from my tool kit and went all over the data center wiping my fingerprints from every handle.  and then i called my customer contact and said ""the data center just went dark.  i smell burnt insulation.  you probably need to get an electrician in here.""  he paged a guy, who came out, looked into the ups, found a fried wire, and said ""here's the culprit!""  he fixed the problem, powered back up the data center, and then the rest of the evening other repair techs and administrators for all the other systems came in to boot up and get things running.  i quietly did my hardware upgrade and left.  
the next morning, my boss asked me to step into his office.  he said that the customer had called him because he wanted to formally thank our company for reporting the power problem, and that if i hadn't shown up for my work early they would have never gotten back online for the next business day.  he handed me a $50 gift certificate to a swanky restaurant and told me to take my wife out for dinner.  i have tifu'd many other times in my career, but that was the biggest one that i got away with and the only time i failed to fess up.  what can i say?  i was young, scared, and it was my first ""real"" job.  lesson learned.

input: Text: for this christmas i came up with the great idea of getting a weighted set of clothes for christmas. my logic behind it was, i could wear the clothes and get slowly used to them so when i take them off i move slightly faster than if i hadn't used them. so i requested to my parents to get me them.

they actually went and got me a weighted vest. i was pretty pleased. throughout the christmas holidays, i've resolved to doing the abdominal plank position for half an hour twice a day; so combined with the weighted vest i've improved my fitness somewhat.

i came up with the idea of wearing the weighted vest to sleep so i could get used to it more easily. yeah, not a great idea. i put it on over the top of my pajamas and went to sleep. i woke up in the middle of the night in horrendous pain and ripped off the weighted clothes, a portion of my chest felt like i had a small spike ball wedged deep inside. for that night and the next several nights it took my three hours to get to sleep. three. frigging. hours.

so the next few days i woke up and thanks to my near crippling ocd did my usual abdominal plank for half an hour and nearly collapsed from the pain afterwards, for the rest of the day i had to walk around looking like the hunchback of notredame to relieve my pain. after about four days i gave in and went to the doctor where i got informed that i've pulled a muscle in between my ribs and have been put on ibuprofen for two weeks.

input: Text: as with alot of these on here, this occurred **not** today, but rather about 3 years ago. also, this is my first post on tifu. i've always lurked and had alot of laughs at some of the epic fu's i've read, but never contributed or even signed up. i found myself remembering this incident we're about to dive into, and the absurdity of it. i figured it would be worthy material to share here. i get a kick out of looking back on it, and i figure some other folks will get a kick out of my eloquently written account of it


now that we've got that out of the way, strap in and please keep all hands and feet inside the ride until it has come to a complete stop. follow me as i set the scene.


**year:** 2012.
 
**location** a modest sized house with a group of inebriated individuals, located in a quiet suburb in the us. *(boy, that sounds like a recipe for disaster already)*

**time**: somewhere in the late night hours of 1am-2am.


let's preface by backtracking a few hours from when things *(quite literally)* came crashing down.


it was a frosty, cold night. winter was in full swing. the chill of the midnight air nipped at my face as i stepped out of the car, beers in hand and a cigarette hanging from my lips. it was dead quiet, except for the occasional car that passed by on the nearby main road, and the closing of our car doors. i had just arrived at the house-in-question with a couple friends and i was freezing. for this story, we'll call those friends charlie and william. 


we had just come from a concert and decided to keep the night going by stopping in at a party. the host was one of our friends and invited us over to join the festivities. i was still slightly buzzed from the overpriced concert beers and i didn't want to end the night just yet. so of course, i was on board to accept the host's invitation to invade his home, enjoy beer that didn't cost a fortune, and make an ass of myself in front of my friends. 


we stroll in through the front door. we're greeted by friends who are sitting around the coffee table in the living room. people are coming and going throughout the house. the air is filled with cigarette smoke, laughter, conversations and music. it's a typical house party. i shed my coat, winter hat, and gloves and then proceed to make my way to the kitchen to stash my beer.


i've partied at this house before and i swear this place has it in for me. the last time i was here, i tripped over a guitar amp in the living room and ended up being the proverbial tree that fell in the forest. the only difference is that everybody was around and everybody heard it. and everybody gave a shit. charlie, william and i made a reference to that incident on this night, but little did we know, it would serve as irony later on. 


fast forward. we're all wandering throughout the house and socializing with friends and other party goers. i'm downing beers and having a great time. i end up in the kitchen and start chatting up this cute girl, who we'll refer to as *""kitchen girl.""* we're getting on pretty well, flirting, and at some point, we had some close physical contact going. arms around each other and that sort of thing. everything's going smooth - even sidestepping a cockblock attempt from a lesbian who had taken a vehement interest in the girl as well.


at some point, in my drunken brilliance, i decide to start circle headbanging - or *""windmilling""* - in the kitchen in front of kitchen girl. yes, full blown windmills, as if i were on stage with cannibal corpse. i don't even remember what spurred that shenanigan or how, but i'm pretty sure it had something to do with our conversation at that moment. all i know is that i had copious amounts of alcohol coursing through my veins; and that is not a good thing when coupled with rapid, disorienting motions such as circle headbanging. it seemed like a good idea at the time. but as dave mustaine once sang - *""hindsight is always 20/20. looking back, it's still a bit fuzzy.""* the irony of that last line is so true, in light of the events to come.


**target in sight and lit**

when i brought my head up from my short cannibal corpse moment, the room started spinning. i'm nowhere in proximity of anything that i can grasp onto, in order to maintain my balance. i fear if i take a step forward to find something, i'll come crashing down. i figured i'll just stand still and wait for my heavy metal carousel to come to a complete stop, before i even think about making a move.


**we have tone. prepare to fire**

it's not working. my equilibrium is now fucked and i feel myself starting to sway. i'm trying to fight it, but vertigo has completely taken hold of me and has other ideas. my body starts shifting and my legs start moving. i knew what was coming.......damn you, physics.


**fox two! missile away!**

i stumble. i reach out preemptively so i can catch myself if i go down. i stumble again. the stumbling turns into a shuffling run. *(the stumble-run that you inadvertently do when you lose your balance and try to catch yourself.)* my feet are stomping towards the other side of the room as inertia takes hold and puts my hunched over body into motion. as i'm picking up speed, i'm trying to regain control of this ill-fated course, but there was no coming back. i'm like bambi on ice being pulled in by the death star tractor beam. i start getting wobbly, and i go careening headfirst across the kitchen like a fucking laser guided missile, homing in towards the cabinet on the other side of the room. oh no....oh no.....


**splash! good effect on target**

**wham!** i found my mark and slammed headfirst into the cabinet with a loud **thunk**, followed by the sound of scattering beer cans as i collapsed on the floor. the whole room went silent and all attention was immediately diverted in my direction upon impact. i was still conscious but it took me a couple seconds to realize what the fuck just happened. and there i was. on the floor, holding my head and muttering profanities while laying in a pile of empty beer cans that had spilled out of their nearby boxes and bags when i came crashing down. what a buffoon! i just had to be that guy, didn't i? charlie comes over to see if i'm ok and helps me to my feet. i'm deemed good-to-go, no signs of concussion or anything. as i'm rubbing my head, i can't help but laugh about the whole thing and i go right back to drinking and socializing. all those beers dulled my sense of pain, but i knew this was gonna hurt worse in the morning. 


at this point, kitchen girl disappeared and i don't think i saw her again for the rest of the night. the lesbian probably stole her away after i did my glorious charade of a human missile in the kitchen. oh well. i ended up leaving the party shortly afterwards and got dropped off at home.

 
i woke up the next day with a knot on my head and a headache to go with it. i started piecing together the events in my head and everything came back to me. needless to say, my buddies didn't let me live down the whole ordeal for a couple days. i made a mental note to bring a helmet next time i go to that house.

input: Text: so ultra tickets just went on sale today and just like anyone else i was pumped. 6 friends and i all wait patiently as we wait for our turns to buy the tickets. we all signed up for pre-registration so we can by tier1 or tier 2 tickets which were $300 and $380 respectively. pre-registration had promo codes that allowed you to buy tier 1 or tier 2 tickets as soon as tickets go on sale. people who didn't sign up don't gain access to tier 1 or tier 2 so they have to by tier 3 which cost $450. my wait in line was 7 minutes so the anticipation was killing me. 1 of my friends manage to get through and bought 2 tier 1, we were so pumped for him. finally it was my turn to buy tickets, i put my code in and manage to buy 4 tickets. filled out all my credit card info and boom tickets purchased. only a second later i saw the price of the tickets which were tier 3. so do the math $450 x 4 plus tax and shipping cost totaling to $1814.75....fuck. soon after my mistake another one of my friends got 2 tier 1 tickets. so if you are keeping track that's 8 tickets for seven people. so yeah my dumb ass didn't realize my mistake and now i'm stuck with not only tier 3 tickets, but one extra one. i just emailed ultramusicfestival.com to see if i can get a refund for one of the tickets, lets just hope i can.

input: Text: i've been living in an apartment building near my university for the past 7 months or so. i live with 3 other guys, two of whom i did not know prior to move in. they're both really nice asian guys who are close friends, but neither speaks very much english so our interactions are limited. we obviously introduced ourselves by name the day i moved in, but, being the careless 20 year old guy that i am, i decided the typical ""bro"", ""man"", and ""dude"" greetings would suffice and didn't bother to make a note of them.

the four of us share a mailbox. knowing i had a package arriving, i ran downstairs and grabbed it along with the rest of the mail. here's where i fucked up: rather than leaving the mail on the counter like i usually do, i figured i'd be a nice guy and personally deliver it to the roommates. first up: a small package for jung-ho feng. 

one of my asian roommates (who i was certain was jung-ho) was sitting at the kitchen table so i approached him and said with a smile ""hey i think i've got some mail for you!"" he stared at the package for a moment and said ""this...this isn't for me."" rather than stopping there and preserving what little dignity i had left, i stupidly responded ""woops, my bad! well could you give it to your friend for me then?"" he gave me a confused look and said ""this isn't his either..."" shocked and embarrassed, i mustered a simple ""oh"" and walked back to my room with my head hung in shame.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so today my plans consisted of; going to work, getting off of work, feeling sorry for myself because i won't be watching star wars. as it turns out, my boss caught the flu over night and could not get his heads-up text that he was going to give me the day off because my phone is out of service as of last night. i don't yet have a car, so i had to call using my boss's phone for a ride. my roommate was a bit annoyed, but luckily decided to come back to pick me up, it's cold out. 

he decides that he'll go swing by the gym and drop me off at the mall for a few hours, then we would meet at a set time and head back home. i told him that if i don't show up in five minutes, he can head back home and i'd just walk. seemed like a plan. so now i'm at the mall, trying out some fancy clothing at sears and just wandering around. it had been some time i've been to hot topic, so i decided ""eh, why the hell not?""

i walk in, and immediately i'm met by a cute girl with blonde hair and pink coloring at the ends, black rimmed glasses, and large sweater for her small size. she informs me of some buy-one-get-half-off sale going on and before we know it, we're both chatting about all sorts of random stuff. she seemed cool and nice. she was only a year younger than me too. we talk for a good twenty or so minutes.

i gather what music she likes, she enjoys doctor who, etc. said she watched a movie while at the mall all day yesterday, creed apparently. she's also from texas like me, so we both hate the cold weather that has been going on lately. 

so eventually i decide to browse around and see if i could find anything, and have her continue working in case she'll get into trouble. nothing seems to interest me much and i happen to glance at my phone, i notice i'm only two minutes away from the set time my roommate is going to pick me up. i need to haul ass. 

as i'm heading out, the girl is giving me a goodbye. i decide, ""you know what? recently single. how's about i ask her to watch a movie with me? she definitely seems into me, and i feel confident enough.""

so i say ""i need to head out in a hurry, buuuut let me ask you; did you watch your movie yesterday alone?""

she said yes. ah, good!

""welllll, how's about we go watch a movie later?"" i say in a suggesting tone and funny arm gestures. she says she's working right now and i said, chuckling, ""obviously not now, i need to head out as well!""

she looks at me in a 'sorry' expression. oh dick, i'm getting rejected...

""oh, shit, sorry, is it kinda odd for a stranger you just met to be asking you out?""

""yeeeeah..."" she says with the same look. 

alright, now i got two reasons to get the hell out of here. 

""shit then, really sorry about that- gotta' go though, i'll catch you later!"" and so i speed walk my way out of the mall, i haul ass to the meeting spot, and i just barely caught up with my roommate. we talk about bidets all the way home. i get on reddit to tell you my tifu story, and now i'm done typing said tifu story. 

and today i shall now feel sorry for not watching star wars *and* for being rejected, *and* for having had been recently dumped. fuck you, holidays.

so this auction comes along with a ton of electronics, and a surprisingly large amount of broken phones, laptops and tablets. tons of working stuff too, but definitely lots of broken stuff. there were 8 ps4's posted. the current bid was 225, and i decided i would try to bid up. i submit $250, but was outbid automatically. so i just went ahead a clicked the button again, for some reason thinking it would stay at $250. i close chrome and go on my day. 

the next morning i realize that i really didn't need the thing, nor really want it. this is when i realized i had bid $300, not 250 or 275. i saw the other ps4s sold for 250, that's when i realized i wouldn't be outbid, and one course the one that sold for more? mine. 

i get to the auction place, pay for the thing, after taxes and fees came to $400. the box was torn up, but everything was there. took it home and what do you know? broken. it turned on but the blu ray drive doesn't work. i'm in talks with sony currently. why did i even bid.

with that said, my real story starts with a group of my friends. i've been busy with work, but have finally been graced with a night off and an invitation to a little gathering. thank fuck.

what i didn't expect was for my crush to be there. she's in the same circle of friends, so it isn't exactly rare to see her, but i wasn't really informed. we're not strangers, either. we fool around occasionally, but things never really progress much further. tonight, it was a bit different.

after a while of all of us shooting the shit, someone mentions going on a food and beer run. some of my friends are some seriously picky eaters, and after a bout of arguing, everyone who wanted food just decided to go. you can see where this is heading.

it didn't take long for us to get into it. things were much more... heated this time around. clothes were falling off. she looks down at my junk, and like in most men's worst nightmare, start cracking the fuck up. my immediate reaction was to get angry. then it hit me. i'd completely forgotten that i've only been mowing half the lawn.

things stopped after this. immediately. our clothes went back on, and when she was finally able to catch her breath she gave me a ""maybe next time.""

input: Text: so i'm a member of the scouts as are lots of my friends who i've known for years. usually once a year we go on a week long camp to the middle of nowhere and while yeah it can be crap it's mainly enjoyable.

this time it was not, it rained the entire week and since we were in the scottish highlands there was little else we could do other than just sort of hope that it went away. so we ended up spending the entirety of the week going between tents and as you can imagine in such cramped conditions after a while everything starts to piss you off. 

one guy in particular had been a total dick the whole week and i decided i was bored enough that i wanted to get back at him for it. earlier in the week in one of the only interesting parts, this guy had found an entire deer skull, antlers and all, in the woods, i figured it was a good way to get revenge.

i was gonna smash the skull.

i decided that i could probably stamp through it so that's just what i tried. on the first stamp i hit the skull but it just sorta sank into the mud, the next stamp definitely did damage and there was a loud pop. 

it was just a shame the damage was that i had landed on the antler and it rammed its way through my hiking boot and about an inch into my foot.

needless to say the whole removal process and then limping about camp with a bin bag on my foot for the rest of the week made me regret getting pissed so easily.

(i ended up getting a crap mark funnily enough). the lesson passed and i didn't talk to anyone. so the end of a very jammy lesson came about and so i had to talk to my maths teacher. being the best teacher i've ever had, she helped me clear my stuff away, lent me some tissues to wipe away my jam that had formed a second skin over my hands and just asked me to tell her what happens if something like this happens again, god forbid it. then came to the awkward convo with my parents. i've been reduced to a crappy old reebok bag for the last months and a half and am still getting weird looks... i've not eaten jam of any sort since. i spent too much time getting old jam off my hands at home and my books are still sticky from the jam and i can't get it off.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so this happened about half a year ago, but 3 of my mates and i decided it'd be a great idea to get super baked (which is legal where i'm from) and just have a chill day

so the day started pretty swell with us getting a whole bunch of snacks from our local supermarket (around $100 worth) and heading back to the house. each of us then ate a quarter of a cake which we had put an ounce of weed into and smoked quite a few bowls after and got the most baked we have ever been.

a few hours later after watching all of season 1 rick and morty and just generally enjoying life we suddenly realised to our horror we had run out of snacks, and even though we were already really full, the munchies won out in the end. 

for some reason at this point i was craving sour patch kids like no tomorrow and despite my friends just wanting to stay at home and order some take away, i managed to convince my friends to walk up this fuckoff sized hill to go outside (as horrible as that is when baked) and go to the supermarket.

the walk started out really nice, beautiful day, the sun was out and birds were chirping. but slowly as i started to walk up the hill i started to feel really queasy but it wasn't anything that bad, just like the feeling of doing one too many shots where you can force it back down. 

at least that's what i thought. the walk to the super market wasn't that far, around 5 minutes or so, so i decided to tough it through and get those damn sour patch kids. eventually we finally make it to the supermarket and at this point i feel like i just did 10 tequila shots then got punched in the stomach by gregor clegane. 

i'm sure i didn't look to healthy either, so in my panic of me trying to avoid throwing up i sit down on a bench right in the middle of the shops wall near the checkouts, where everyone can see you. i put my head in between my knees and spent around 5 minutes trying to keep this vomit down, with tons of glancing at me probably wondering what is wrong. keep in mind i am super, super baked and even talking with strangers terrifies me, let alone the chance of seeing someone i know at my local supermarket. 

but eventually i just simply can't hold it in anymore. it happens, a foul concoction of everything from chips, powerade, chocolate, 2 minute noodles, other sorts of lollies erupts out of me in proper projectile vomit all over the supermarket floor, at this point my friends have pretty much bailed in their baked panic (do not blame them at all) and i sit there throwing up probably a good 2-3 litres worth of food and stomach acid with people all around me. i was freaking out at this point because i could recognise a few people in the store, all of who were looking at me quite shocked.

then i just fucking get up and run away in my panic as the staff yell at me to stop as i leave my mess behind. 

have to say that isn't one of my most proud moments and i doubt i'll ever be going back to that super market ever again. 

didn't even get my sour patch kids

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so this happened two days ago. i work at a supermarket chain, as a cashier. been there for about four years. pretty mindless job, the pay sucks, but it is a job noneless. 
so anyway, there are a lot of younger girls (early 20's) that work at the same place, doing the same job. we don't count out our drawers, or have key locks on them - for some reason management thinks this is a good idea. we also have two video cameras in the entire store, one in the backroom, and one facing the parking lot. that is it
so on friday, one of the newer girls, who must have been working for about 3 months or so, comes barreling out of the managers office in the evening, her face beat red and balling her eyes out. apparently her register had come up short for the day (by 195 dollars), and my boss was threatening her with firing and arrest.
now i really don't know this girl very well, other then she is a single mom, trying to make ends meet, seems pretty normal enough.
this is where the fuck up happens. for some reason, i'm not sure what came over me, i stop in the path of my boss, who was in the process of following her out of the door, and start completely throwing myself under the bus. i told him i was on her register all day, and that i had told her to go check product dates instead. after giving me an incredulous look, and unleashing a barrage of yelling at me, he basically told me to get lost and don't come back, and expect to be hearing from the police. none of this actually registered until i left the store, what had happened.
so now i'm out of a job, so low paying that i don't even have a savings, and will probably be booted out of my apartment, and expecting to be charged. all for a girl that, for all i know, skimmed money out of the register.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: winter is finally upon us, and my house is 100 years old. that means i have ac units to take in and out every year. 

 about four day ago this huge cold front came through my state and we had 20 degree weather plus some snow. that meant i could no longer procrastinate about taking out the five acs i have scattered through out my house. 

 it's a fairly simple process - just take them out the window, weatherstrip the window, and put the acs in the basement. i ended up taking the three ""bigger"" ones out first with no sweat. 

 that's when i go into my nephews room and try to pull his out. what i didn't realize was although his was smaller compared to the rest it was also two times heavier. it also wasn't actually put in right. 

 so i grab it from underneath and lift up the window when all of a sudden the whole thing shifts crushing my right hand underneath it out of no where! somehow this smaller ac is twice as heavy as the others and my hand is pinned against the scalding hot metal radiator. 

 not only is it being crushed. it's also being burned! in one simple motion with my body i pull it up trying to save my hand from burning or being crushed and what happens? the whole thing shoots back from the window and hits the top of my roof hard! 

 i should bring up the fact i just bought a new washer machine and so my concern is 100% not spending any more money on appliances. especially with christmas coming up real quick. i have gifts to buy other people! my mind in that moment was 100% focused on, ""this shit is expensive! hell no!"" 

 so being the quick thinking instinctual genius i am i leap through the window head and arms first super man style while banging my knees and legs against the radiator and window sill. i start sliding across my icy roof chasing the falling ac when i realize i have way to much momentum, and holy fuck i'm about to fall headfirst off two stories! 

 life didn't flash before my eyes. realizing i'm a fucking idiot flashed in my head! 

  luckily, natural reactions took over and i bang my fist, nails, knees and then feet down into the roof as hard as i can and started slowing down. i actually slammed them down so hard i ripped shingles off! 

 right as i stop my speed and avert death ---- i quickly grab the ac cord with one hand and halt basically all of its momentum right as the corner dips and falls into my gutter! one more second later and it would have rotates off! 

 that's when this guy on my street who saw the whole thing starts cheering! he's whooping and hollering loud as hell, and i start smiling. i'm thinking, ""holy shit. that was awesome! i wish i had that recorded! i feel like an action movie hero"".

 all my previous thoughts about my intelligence went out the window as fast as the ac did. 

  i pick the ac up with gusto, and start waddling up the roof. that's when life swiftly reminded i'm still a fucking idiot. 

 you see in my excitement i totally forgot the roof was in fact covered with ice. so not only did i slip but i basically slipped so hard forward that i bet i could have done a front flip with a bit more clearance. 

 for whatever reason i didn't let go of the ac in both hands. maybe my brain knew i was committed to saving it and compromised. one hand held onto the ac from the bottom while the other hand shot out for the window. 

 my full momentum, weight, plus the ac  crushed my hand. i knocked the wind out of my body and hit my head on the window all in a second smooth motion. 

 i have no idea how i didn't let go of the ac or the window but somehow i did. i held onto it like a lost lover and slowly dragged myself into the safety of my house. 

 i'd love to say i went back through the window with style but i did not. i kind of plopped through it like a fish and laid on the ground.

 i guess my nephew finally decided to come and see what the noise was and panicked when he looked at me. he thought i was committing suicide because i was so bloody and banged up with torn clothes. 

 it took me a long time to explain what happened to him. he couldn't grasp how i hurt myself so quickly. 

 i ruined and ripped my clothes. i cut open my knees and shin. i have a deep gash on my head and scalp. i must have caught a nail somewhere on my torso because i have a long scratch. i had a splinter in my toe? (no idea.) i had dark bruises everywhere and could not function physically the next day.

 the top of my hands were beyond recognition. two nails were full of blood and many were ripped. they swelled up and only my thumbs went unscathed. i burnt one hand, tore the skin off both, and crushed one hand badly. i possibly broke the knuckles or worse on one but we will see when i go to the doctors thursday. oh, and i ripped off a nail.
 
 the good news? the ac is fine! just some dents here and there. maybe some skin and blood, but nothing a quick wash can't fix.

 bad news? the roof was damaged a bit.

 the ugly? i scared my nephew and probably lost a ton of respect.

input: Text: this fu actually happened today, on my work break.

currently, i am a nursing assistant at a nursing home. about a week ago, i finally plucked the courage to get my septum pierced. i haven't had any problems with it, and i make sure the area is clean throughout the day. so, during one of those cleaning regimes - i retreat to the staff bathroom on my break to bring down my septum piercing (i flip it up during work to conceal it). as i'm sniffing and doing general nose stuff, one of the cleaners and biggest workplace gossips walks in. 

""oh, it's only you."" i say, laughing. i was just glad it wasn't one of the bosses - they hate piercings and body mods.

she gives me this strange look but kind of dismisses what i said, then questions what i was doing.

""oh you know, breaking the rules."" i laugh again, assuming this cleaner knows i have a piercing. i was almost certain she had seen it before. 

she gives me another weird look as i dab my nose with a tissue (i also had the sniffles) and kind of scurries out the door. weird. i forget about it and go back to work. 

about half an hour later, one of the big bosses pulls me aside and asks me to meet with her in the office. she's watching me as we're walking and, being me, i'm always super cheerful and whatever. i must seem.. high, sometimes.

as soon as we get into the office, she questions if i take drugs. i'm like, whaaaaaaat. no, i don't. she then let's me know a coworker has had suspicions that i have been doing cocaine whilst on work premises.

i just roll out with the whole piercing thing and blah blah but my boss kind of buys it and kind of doesn't. so i have to show her the piercing. 

i'm still getting weird looks.

(also, i forgot to mention the train is packed at this point). as she scoots by, she drops something and bends over to pick it up, the train suddenly jerks and i thrust into her from behind. she turns around and says ""you need to keep your hands to yourself!"", i was so taken off guard that i just looked at her and said "" the trains packed and i didn't mean to bump you, so don't flatter yourself"" and sat down. sat there beyond embarrassed for 4 more stops.

input: Text: this reddit should be renamed to just ifu, because this actually happened last month.

i'm a middle child of 3 kids, both of my siblings are female and i'm the only male in my immediate family, outside of my father. i love them both, but they have ""issues"" that drives me nuts.

my older sister, let's call her cass, is very easy to guilt trip me and other people. i already have a low self esteem already, but for some reason she finds a way to make myself help her by almost falling on my face.

my little sister, let's call her cal, is a massive klutz. i can understand being a little weird, but this chick has been in the hospital as a patient for almost half of her life. one would think she could be a little bit more careful. she also can't hold things very well.

well, anyway, back to what i was saying.

i was at a friends house as it was my birthday the next day and they wanted to have a game night (mostly d&d and some smash 4, nothing big) and i get a call form cass. she wanting to use my laptop for one of her courses. i find this odd, considering she had a laptop of her own and she has word free from her collage.

after a few minutes of begging, i say yes and tell her the password, as well as where i put my spare key (i live in the garage and have a personal lock and key, my mom spoiled me, i know.) she thanked me and hung up, sounding ecstatic and hangs up. i forget about it very quickly.

around midnight, we decided to pack up after our tank had to leave since he had to do something in the morning. i went home and decided to go to bed early. cal was sitting there, looking surprised and stressed.

""oh hey, cityofcyn_!""

cal shouted it out, i can tell something's going on.

""what did you do?""

""nothing.""

""where's cass?""

""no where.""

it might be i take after mom, but i smell bs when i can. i start making it the garage, my sister trying to keep me from entering. when i finally got in, i see cass, sweeping up pieces of my laptop.

apparently, my sisters got me a new desktop and it wouldn't be here for about another week, so they got me  display for show me how it would look on my desk. but instead, my little sister, who was moving my laptop, droped it, causing it shatter (it was a old toshiba, i knew what i was getting into.)

i'm not mad at them, but i am upset that i lost so much (500 gb of images, personal works, music, and games) with little way without paying a large amount to transfer them. i know this isn't really my fuck up, but i figured it was an interesting story to tell, none the less.

well, as it turns out, she also has an uncle vernon... the *same* uncle vernon. and here i am telling her how hilarious this could've been and how funny i think it is now and how close i came to embarrassing myself and making this person feel like crap.... and i ended up doing that and so much worse to my own girlfriend. so now i feel like crap, and yeah, i know i shouldn't because i couldn't have possibly known, but still. that kind of thing just sits with you.

input: Text: this actually happened last night and i feel so stupid even now. i was on my way back from a friend's and i slept off. now, before you go saying i was the irresponsible one, hear me out. i had worked three continuous days in a row, functioning on less than 3 hours of sleep. the air was cool and the driver was playing some really soothing music.

i knew the road he was taking, so i decided to shut my eyes for a bit and lay back - it takes around 45 minutes to get home. i have no idea when i passed out and i woke when the driver suddenly stopped the car. it was dark everywhere and the driver wanted me to get out of the car because he had another pick-up. and i freaked out. 

i was suddenly extremely alert and realised that i didn't recognise any of my surroundings. i started yelling at the driver that he brought me to some unknown place and said some shit like, ""i have a swiss army knife, you can't harm me!"" - yeah, that's how freaked out i was.

oh, and i was refusing to get out of the car. i kept arguing with him when suddenly someone knocked on my window and i yelled this blood-curling scream. turned to see it was my flatmate asking if everything was alright and why i wouldn’t get out of the car. i thought i was hallucinating and actually rolled down my window and pinched my flatmate to see if it were actually him.

needless to say, it was him. i paid the driver and went home. couldn’t sleep a wink after that and now i’m at work again with zero sleep.

input: Text: i know there are a lot of cat related tifus. they're little fuckers, aren't they?

my gf had asked me to wash the cat, because it might help her allergies. i had a free evening tonight, and i thought i might try it.

after googling ""how to wash a cat"" a few times, i lured the kitty into the bathroom, and closed the door. now she's mine, i thought. heh heh heh

first, i tried washing her in the sink, as the results had recommended, but my sink doesn't seal well, so after getting the cat's feet wet, i gave up. she sought shelter in the litter box while i prepared the bathtub instead.

i thought that her getting litter on her wet feet sucked, so i coaxed her out, and dipped her in the water, which immediately became nasty because it was filled with litter. so i released the cat, and started changing the water. she immediately hid in the cat box again.

sigh, i thought, this time i'll have to move the cat box. after the water was clean and ready to go, i took the lid off the litter box, and the cat looked up at me with her big kitty eyes. how cute, i thought. i picked her up, and suddenly, there was shit spewing out of her butt.

for some reason, she decided it was a good time to take a dump, and i may have lost my composure, because i tried to get her in the water to rinse her off, but she resisted, which led to her ass spinning around, launching shit in every direction.

and it was liquidy shit, too. the worst kind.

i did manage to wash the cat, eventually, but i have been cleaning for about an hour, and i'm still not done. i may never be clean again.... :(

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i'm new to reddit. i got it a few weeks ago. i saw the tifu subreddit and had to contribute. so i'll do it on a throw away account. this happened several months ago, so i'm sorry this isn't quite a tifu. 
a few months ago i (18, m) was knee deep in sexting. i had somehow started with a past girlfriend over the summer and was really getting into it. i loved the thrill of it. i would sext up to three girls at time while at my dads house (the only place i have wifi for snapchat). for me the process of it was being sharpened. i would send them a picture of myself in a towel after showering, and depending on their reaction i could sift out who would and wouldn't be willing to sext me. these fine ladies would sometimes randomly send me pictures once i had so to speak ""broken the sexting ice."" 
one fine evening i sat in my room, half-consciously playing my latest disappointing investment known as destiny, when i get a snapchat from a girl named melissa. she was a girl a bit older than me (six years or so) who i had started talking to on facebook. she now had my snapchat and had sent me a lot of pictures of herself in her underwear. i opened my ipod expecting another pic of herself in her undies. when i opened her snapchat i ended up staring at it for the whole five seconds that it lasted: melissa had just stepped out of the shower and taken a mirror selfie. the gorgeous brunette was still glistening with water, she positioned her hips in just the right way to give her a nicely curved ass. she pushed her arms together to capitalize on her massive boobs. each one of the things were about the size of my head. i am an ass man, but these ee sized guns were enough to make my blood run cold. she wore a smile that was seductive enough to disarm a nuke.
as soon as i could collect my brain after it being blown to pieces to pieces, i naturally responded with a picture of my crotch. i was shaking with excitement. my hand covered about half of my chubbed noodle (the logic here is that if she wants to see more she has to send more). i captioned it ""send more to see the whole thing."" 
what happened next might come out slightly confusing if you don't use snapchat. i tapped the arrow in the lower right corner, which led me to the list of snapchat usernames. at the top of the list was melissa's name. i tapped her name and hit send with the speed only a testosterone-fueled pervsturbator could have.
my ipod did nothing. the screen remained unchanged. it was an overused fourth-generation ipod touch so it wasn't uncommon for the hunk of shit to freeze up. i waited about five seconds then it flashed a screen that showed the check mark next to a name at the top of the ""recent"" list. i was left staring dumbfounded at my screen. i had just sent a dick pic to my best friends sister. kerrigan had snapchatted me asking if i was going to hang out with brandon (my best friend) that weekend whilst i was about to hit melissa's name. 
the feeling at the time was almost indescribable. i literally felt the blood run out of my dick until it was about the size of a cheeto. i wanted to go take a nap with my car running in the garage, but somehow i managed to pick myself up and snapchat her. kerrigan's immediate response was disgust. in a flurry of explanations, apologies, and begging i somehow managed to get her to calm down and agree not to tell anyone. and if you were wondering i also halfheartedly finished up with melissa. 
before i go on to the consequences of my actions let me tell you about the johnsons (we'll call them that for pun and privacy purposes) as they are a very unique family. i have known the johnsons for five years. they are very sarcastic, yet very likable. very cynical, yet hilarious. very judging, yet very loving. simple, yet very wise. brandon was my first friend when i first came to school five years ago (i was homeschooled until i hit 8th grade). our moms had worked together for a period of time as well, and are now good friends. his older sister kerrigan became a good friend of mine throughout the years. the family literally introduces me to people they know as their ""adopted"" son. so you could imagine the mortification of kerrigan when out of the blue comes a picture of my penis and a demand for ""more pictures.""
skip forward a week. it was my first wrestling meet of the season. to my surprise kerrigan and her friends whom i knew quite well came to watch. i, with my odd sense of humor, threw her a deranged look with a grin and a wave. she awkwardly waved back with a somewhat creeped out smile. after the meet they all approached me. lacy, one of kerrigan's friends started the conversation with ""so i heard you sent dic pics to kerrigan."" i turned to a giggling kerrigan slightly angry and said something like ""really?"" 
eventually over the next weeks i found out from brandon that when kerrigan got my savory snapchat she ran screaming down her dorm hallway that i had sent her a nudy-judy . she also mentioned it in a massive group chat on facebook that contained her whole class and my art teacher. if that wasn't enough she went out of her way and called her mom and my ex specifically to tell them what i did. my ex in turn called up her friends to let them know the immensity of my blunder. mrs. johnson found this sensational, she told brandon, mr. johnson, and the entire staff at the nursing home at which she works. the johnsons weren't angry because they knew i didn't mean to send it to kerrigan. they knew to keep it a secret from my mother. mom would probably brand a cross into my forehead if she knew about this (god, i'm a genius. posting this online was a great idea). eventually the whole school knew. even a few teachers knew about it. one of them called me out on it in the middle of social issues class; thus, making me the most laughed at person in the school for the whole day. i even got shit from some small kids in the elementary.
ever since that fateful day i haven't sexted. i right away told the people i was doing it with that i was going to stop. i still get laughed at by entire classes at least once a week, but i deserve it, and i do have to admit it is pretty funny.
this tifu has a few morals: sexting is a bad idea, true friends never press charges, and always double tap someone's name in snapchat to respond.

input: Text: i'm a lifelong new yorker.  spend enough time in the city and you become immune to homeless and to panhandlers.  if they ask you for money, which happens about 25 times a day, you just say ""no, sorry"" and move on.  i'm not saying it's a good thing, i'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it's just what happens to everyone over time.  it would happen to you too if you were exposed to it as often as we are.  sad but true.

the train station i go to in the morning has a bunch of homeless who hang there.  they usually don't ask the commuters for money, but it occasionally happens.  usually it's ""can you help me buy a ticket to wherever?""  today i was waiting near the ticket machine, when one of them gave me the same line.  he had a dollar in his hand, and asked if i could help him buy a ticket to wherever. i just gave him the reflexive, callous ""no"" and went back to what i was doing.

he walked away and went up to another person with the same question.  then i saw her take him to the ticket machine and show him how it works.  he proceeded to buy a ticket with his own money.  all the guy was doing was asking how the machine works, and i ""noped"" him out.  felt like going up and apologizing, but there would have been no explanation that didn't make me sound like an ass.  because that's what i was.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so in 6th grade, i fucked up, but it became one of the foundations for one of the best things in my life. here we go: 

the year is 2007 and i'm in 6th grade. in my town that means that i'm spending my last year at the elementary school that hitherto, i've spent my entire academic and social life. next year my class will be merging with the classes of the 5 other elementary schools in my town to form our middle school. as anyone who has advanced to the next level in school knows, this is a huge fucking deal. every 6th grader knows that 7th grade is when you take that next step towards adulthood and really start living. because the legendary middle school years can be full of sleepovers, pizza parties, energy drinks, maybe even a cringe-worthy first kiss. the future is bright! if you're among the pre-teen cultural elite. that is.

luckily for me, a generally awkward 11 year old leaving elementary school with 2 friends and half a library of fantasy-fiction books in my room, my rec center plans two high-stakes, be there  or be square, social-catapult type events to introduce all the students across the city to each other. the first is a test of athleticism,  an absolutely crucial skill for any young man hoping to join a posse of cool young gentlemen and perhaps attract a gal. the second is a social gala, a dance per se, where one may hope to waltz themselves into popularity with rhythmic excellence and social grace. this fu happens at the open gym. 

it’s on a friday night, and everything starts of smoothly. mom executes a perfect car-pool drop off, getting us there right on time because everyone knows that’s the coolest time to arrive at an event. everything starts great, strangers from across the town are all present and showing off their athletic prowess.  double dutch is happening, an intense round of freeze tag is in-action, and i’m making friends! i make one friend in particular, we’ll call him hank, who seems to be quite alright. i helped him out of a few tough spots during freeze-tag and i’m getting along with his crew from across town real nicely. so we grab ourselves a few libations to cool down and chat before getting involved in another feat of athleticism. after a few capri-sun, and plenty of laughs (i had the best fart jokes),  an important announcement is made. it’s wiffle ball time. 
this is important. for one: the balance, poise, speed and strength required by the game of wiffle ball make it the perfect example of a preteens athleticism. but my town is actually the town where the original wiffle ball factory is (honestly, they probably got the supplies donated because of this) and in my eyes this makes this about as important a local pastime as hotdogs and fireworks on the 4th of july!  

teams are made, and as it turns out i’m opposing hank, the friend i’m currently courting. this is perfect, because obviously the best way to make new male friends is to assert your dominance by beating them via sport. 

i immediately find my way in to line. i’m batting 4th.  a powerful position. clean-up hitter. 

hank happens to be pitching and he’s doing alright. he strikes out two of the three batters ahead of me because he has a mean slider. but i’m ready for that. 

after what seems like ages i step up to bat. 

i arrive he plate with glory in my head. nay, glory within in reach. there’s one man on base but and rbi isn’t cool. a single isn’t cool. i know the only option for me is an inside the  gym home-run. the epitome of sportly excellence.  my eyes are on the crown of middle school popularity, and this skinny yellow plastic bat is going to fly me there. obviously i call me shot a la babe ruth. 

the ball leaves hank’s hands. 

suddenly everything is slow motion. i can see the ball spin as it approaches me. it begins to dip but i’m ready for it. i’m going to catch the ball the second crosses the plate and send it to mars with a rocket up its ass. all i here is the telltale whistle of the wiffle ball. it’s within my reach and i swing away! swing myself to absolute glory! i connect to the ball and…

i slice it, right to the ground where it slowly rolls towards the pitcher. as people laugh at my misfortune i only have one option, to sprint towards first base and put my fate in the hands of hank’s reflexes. or perhaps there’s a second option? perhaps i toss this bat towards the ball i just woefully under-hit, to knock it off course and complete my original plan to sprint my way to  a homerun. 

the second i have this idea, my arm puts it into action, i toss the bat expertly towards the ball to knock it ever so slightly off course. only i don’t toss the bat. with an accidental flick of the wrist i turn that bat into a plastic missile that’s heading right for the ball. right for where hank is currently lunging. right for his nose. literally, square on the bridge of  his nose. 

the rest is a bit of a blur, there’s shouting, hank falls down. chaperones rush to his aid. children scream at me for being the bat-happy maniac with a temper that i seem to be. the opposite of glory.  hank was attended to by an emt that came to stop his nose from bleeding, and luckily it was just a minor break. i spent the rest of a night wallowing in the corner of the room, wishing i didn’t exist, or have such poor in-the-moment judgment. i felt terrible for hurting a kid i thought i was becoming friends with. and getting middle school off to such an awful start, was a poor consolation. like icarus i flew too high with my dreams and plummeted to my doom. 

that september, i walked into my homeroom class only to find hank sitting directly behind me. my heart dropped, i knew my reputation as a bandit-bat-basher would follow me to my grave. instead, he cracks a joke about it. i ended up sharing classes, laughs and some of the best memories of my life with that kid for the next 6 years (throughout middle school and high school). to this day he’s one of my best friends, (and he still has a bump on the bridge of his nose (from yours truly).

input: Text: so today i decided i'd give my lady remington a full-body trial. i skipped the genital region, but i got everywhere else.

face: as good as a blade, which is to say, not as good as i'd like but nothing i can do about that. plus side: no cuts, which i can't say for the razor.  
arms, legs, chest, belly, hands, feet: acceptable. my arms and legs aren't particularly hairy, so i got a preliminary shave before my shower and touched up after, when i could see the hairs better. hands and feet are even less hairy, but still hairier than a cis woman's.  
armpits: and here's the fuck-up. i knew that my pits are the single most sensitive region of my skin, and i knew that they were irritated for days after the last time i tried to shave them with the lady remington. well, they seemed fine at first. then in the shower, the soap hit them and ow. so i put some shaving cream on them (it has moisturizer in it) to see if that would help and ow. so i just rinsed them off, because whatever. i finished up, got out, and dried off.

then i put deodorant on and ow the fires of hades have taken residence beneath my arms so i bore the pain for a moment, hoping it would go away. nope. bracing for more pain, i use the towel to wipe off the deodorant. then i grabbed a different deodorant (a spray type, without an antiperspirant) and sprayed it across my chest and then sprayed it into one of my armpits. cue hellfire again, wipe that shit off, you know the drill.

so, once the irritation subsides in a few days, i'll switch back to a blade for my pits. but the lady remington works well everywhere else, so that's a plus.

input: Text: happened a month or 2 ago but here goes.

i bought a fitbit from rei to track my steps, sleep, heartrate etc. for a new months it was awesome and worked flawlessly. i had worn it in the shower a few times and even though the fitbit says its water resistant, you should take it off when you shower. so after a long day i took a much needed shower but was too lazy to take my fitbit off. long story short, it got water inside it and stopped working.

rei has an awesome return policy where you can basically return your purchases for any reason within a year, and since my fitbit was still under warranty i went back to get a new one. i got into the store and tell the help desk employee my fitbit got waterlogged and i would like a replacement. here's where the fu happens. the employee gives me a $150.00 refund for the fitbit then tells me to go pick out a replacement. i go to the fitbit section to get a replacement and there aren't any left. one of the employees goes to the back and gets me one from storage, gives it to me and tells me i'm good to go. i walk out of the store.

apparently you're supposed to go back to the help desk after you get your replacement, this they did not tell me. so i walked out of the store with a new fitbit plus the refund from the old one. i check my bank balance when i get to my car and it says the $150.00 was added to my bank and i assumed they would just charge me for it when they go through processing the return. 2 days goes by and i check my bank balance again, the money is still there. 

i debated keeping the money and the fitbit since it was the store's fault they didn't tell me to go back to the register, but my morality got the best of me and i went back and sorted it out. they thanked me for my honesty and gave me a $20 giftcard to the store.

input: Text: we just got back from a camping in 31°c. i used the toilet to pee.. a lot. 

we got back into town, offloaded the trailer and i figured i'd dump the full grey water tank (dish/sink used water tank). 

unfortunately - i didn't think to check if the 2/3 full black water (poo/pee holding tank) valve was in or out. 

the moment i open the valve cap, dark chunky water with a heavy ammonia smell absolutely blasts out - spraying me and the driveway, the white fence. 

i immediately see what i've done, panic and run for the hose so i can at least dilute the stench. the hose (fancy xhose) is tied in knots and the awful smell is building. i run the hose, start spraying the drive way with reckless abandon... and realize that the black water valve hasn't yet been closed. 

i close everything out, let the water run down the driveway for a good twenty minutes with some dish soap liberally squeezed on the driveway for good measure. 

it's been an hour and it only smells like strong yet stale pee now if the wind kicks up.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so this is happening right now, but first a backstory.  i had just come home from italy yesterday, and fell asleep at 7 pm est (no unpacking anything).  i ended up waking at 3 am est (still not used to the 6 hour time difference).  i just lied around in bed waiting for 5 am est to come around so i can get ready to head to work.

i have a medical condition in which i have trouble staying awake throughout the day (been tested, etc.)   it's not like narcolespy (where people fall asleep at random) but its hyper-somnolence (in which the chemicals in my brain are basically not telling me to wake up so i get tired throughout the day, as if i haven't gotten any sleep (when in fact i've gotten perfect sleep (been tested, etc.).  so the first thing i do when i wake up is i take my vyvanse, so it can start working and i can get through the day somewhat normally and not feeling constantly exhausted.

i have a second medical condition which is ibs-d (something i wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy).  to control it i take a powder drink every night, well just getting home finally i forgot about my drink and went straight to bed.  (also i had taco bell the night before).  so when i woke up, i realized this and wanted to take lomotil so i could prevent the explosion in my pants from happening.

this is where the fu starts.  i took the medicine, head to work, and about an hour later i start to feel weird.  well i have trouble sleeping and therefore i have ambien, and at that moment i realized i took my vyvanse and ambien 15mg of it.  so the fu starts here, and who knows how much longer of the fu will continue.  i'm hoping the vyvanse will wear off the affects, and i'm trying to get a hold of my partner who is still asleep about what i should do.  i had an adderall from when i was being prescribed adderall before switching to vyvanse but i don't know where that prescription is.

hopefully the vyvanse will counteract with the ambien and everything will be good, we shall see, so this might or might not be the end of the post.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened about a year ago during my finals. everything was going fine, i was studying, and doing fairly well on my exams, i was always on time, and always prepared for whatever. 
well, not exactly, turns out i should've focused a bit more on the exam schedule.
my school has this weird thing where they put the exam dates for 8th 9th and 10th grade on the same schedule but on different columns, and by some miracle, the exam order for 9th and 10th grade was exactly the same, well, except for the last 2 sessions. 
and that's a problem because i always looked at the 9th grade order, not the 10th, so one day, when i thought i had a free day to chill and catch up, i get a call from my angry and obviously rushing mother to get dressed as i missed out on half of my business exam, i get a strange look in my face and question the sanity of such a statement before looking at the schedule, really looking, and realizing my fuck-up. i paled on ran around like a crazy chicken, putting on my school uniform, making myself look presentable and studying all at the same time.
i had only done one 20 page chapter, and had another 3, each longer than the last, i had at most, 15 minutes. 
in those 15 minutes i went into an adrenaline based rapid super study mode while simultaneously praying to weird deities i invented, like time-reversoro and unfuckitupit. 
my calls went un-answered and i went into the exam nearly blind. as i entered school premises i rushed into the filled classroom like a madman, my eyes sweeping over the room as my disheveled panting figure grabbed everyone's attention, their eyes followed me as i sat down and rapidly wrote some scientific gibberish on my paper, i relied on my memory completely and likely siphoned every possible detail i could think of. 
thankfully, i passed. 
and got the highest grade in class. 
which admittedly, wasn't that high, and got me into a ton of trouble, still, its some form of achievement right?

input: Text: tifu, or rather last year i did. this happened during my senior year of high school. i was in my principles of engineering class, and we were designing tiny houses. the houses needed to have a place to sleep, a bathroom, and a kitchen. i figured i'd save some space by getting one of those stoves that also has a built-in refrigerator and sink. so, i proceed to go on google images to find a good brand/model. i find [a nice-looking one](http://www.appliancesbuyphone.com/images/p/ck362.jpg) and proceeded to click ""visit page"". 
well, after i went to the page, i got a screen that has my school's logo on it and says ""you are not allowed to view this page because it is categorized as **porn**."" i'm a little confused, but our school's filtering system is pretty weird. i think that maybe i accidentally clicked on something else. i try again, and the same thing happens. after the third attempt at finding out more about this stove, i get a message: ""you are suspended from internet use for the next 24 hours"" (or something like that). i ended up being a day behind on the project because i couldn't get the dimensions for the stove and had to go to school early one day so i could finish it.
also, when i tried going to the page at home, it was just the website for the company that makes the stove. i have no idea why my school thought it was pornographic. i'm glad i don't go to that school anymore because they banned pretty much everything that wasn't gmail and their own website.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: surprise surprise, this actually happened years ago. seven years ago.

a little back story, when i was 14 my cousin made me get my nipple pierced as a birthday present for herself. my cousin loves making me do things i don't really want to because she's evil and likes to make me suffer. which is why this was a gift to herself. why didn't i fight back and say no? there's no arguing with her. ever. and as i'm sure people will ask, how did i manage to get my nipple pierced at such a young age? her mom payed for it and since we have the same last name she just said she was my mom. also, what kind of place agrees to pierce an underage girl's nipple? the kind that is set up in a swapmeet. yeah. 

anyway, i got it pierced and it actually didn't hurt. at all, for an hour, then the 3 month healing period started and that was a bitch. but i loved it. my god did i love this thing. i took care of it too. i cleaned it regularly, i had many rings for it, and i loved showing it off. especially because i was so not the kind of person you'd expect to have a nipple piercing. i was that girl that sat in back of class reading books the entire time and never talked to anyone. i loved this thing so much sometimes my friends would catch me pulling the neck of my shirt open so i could admire it. 

onto to the sad part. three years later. i was showering. i was scrubbing my chest rather vigorously with my loofah because i used to get horrible acne there if i didn't exfoliate often. i swiped across my chest and my nipple ring got caught in the loofah. now, i wasn't wearing a regular doorknocker that day. i was wearing an eyebrow ring with cones instead of balls, why? because it looked cute. like a little devil. well, i yanked that loofah. i yanked it hard. and i felt pain. true pain. pain starting from my nipple and spreading to my armpits then my navel. it felt like hitting your funny bone. multiplied by a million. i fainted in the fucking shower. remember, when i got it pierced, it didn't hurt? but this. oh. my. god. i still haven't felt anything that painful ever since and i kicked a sea urchin once. 

well, when i came to, i looked down at my nipple expecting the worst. but it was totally fine! it was tender, but it was fine. or so i thought.

two weeks later i was changing the ring and i noticed the skin around it looked dry and little scaly and swollen and it looked crooked. so i picked some of the skin near the inside of the piercing, and i had to tug at it. at first nothing. but a few tugs and it tore a little! and pus came pouring out! at this point i thought i might loose my nipple. i love my nipple you guys. i almost cried. but i didn't. instead i took my boob in one hand and with the other hand i pinched my nipple and squeezed. and so much puss. and then blood. and then nothing. and then the tears finally came. 

i never put the ring back in. my nipple has two scars now. it still makes me sad. especially because one scar is lower than the other. i have a crooked nipple piercing scar.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: one of the companies i work with has outsourced much of their phone support to native america. as a result of this and the fact most company-wide it related communications come from my email address, i regularly get emails and calls from people looking for a quick answer to almost any it related question. i typically ignore them. occasionally, if i'm in a good mood and it's a simple thing, i'll reply. 

so, today i get a call from ""carson"" in security (i can't say whether i'm using his real name or not, because i could barely understand him through the thick southern drawl). he accidentally disconnected the video cable to the building's digital display system doing something. what he was doing, i can only guess, but it's an educated guess after i found out what happened later. anyhow... from what he described, there's three computers at that desk: one is the computer that all of the digital displays in that park mirror, one is the computer that monitors and configures the security badge system, and one owned by the security contracting company that is extranet (not on the company's network system) for their email.

i only answered the call because the masking told me it came from inside the company and possibly important, so i tell him i can't assist. he apologizes for calling me directly, but says ""i hate calling [the helpdesk] and having to repeat everything i say to 'habeeb', and i'm in a real hurry."" (i should point out that his southern accent was of a variety that made it hard for me to understand, so i can empathize with ""habeeb""). he tells me he accidentally unplugged the ""tv system"", which i gather he thinks is a closed circuit system, and needs me to help him ""sort the spaghetti"" so the digital display system will be functional when people come to work in a few minutes. after telling him that he should call the a/v group, and him persisting, i ask him to look for a digital splitter box and describe what it looks like. finally, he finds it, and when i ask him to read what it says, he rattles off the brand and other non important things before saying ""vga input.""

i tell him to find a vga cable, and he has no idea what one is. i describe it to him and he says there are two like that. i tell him to contact the a/v group again, but he starts swearing because it's now 8am, and people are arriving, it'll take too much time, etc. exasperated, i ask him what color the two cables are, and he says one is blue and one is white. ""a-ha!"" i think, ""the blue is the vga and the white is dvi."" since most of the cables that come with monitors are colored that way. i tell him it's the blue one, he tells me he's plugging in the blue cable, and after a moment i ask ""all set?""

there's a long silence, as he probably had set down the phone. i ask if it worked again, and he just exhales. 

after another couple seconds he says, ""that wasn't the right cable, so it's gotta be the other one. thanks a heap,"" he says politely, and hangs up. happy to have the call over and pleased with the fact i did someone a solid, i go back to reading my emails and forget about it.

so it was this evening i was doing a lync session with one of the teams from that company. halfway through, one of the guys passes the screen sharing to someone else to present, and the second guy says ""hold on, not yet! i have a video chat going..."" and everyone laughs. i ask ""oh, so did they finally pilot 2013 for you guys, now?"" (that company disabled lync video and isn't on 2013 lync, yet) to which everyone laughs harder. when they realize i'm totally oblivious to what they're taking about, they tell me some security guy in the ""brain lanes"" (sarcastic nickname for the r&d complex) shared some video chat window he had with all of the digital displays, and was promptly canned.

i didn't tell them about the phone call, nor did i ask about what was in the video chat. i just said ""huh,"" and we continued with our meeting. i guess they have white vga cables there. maybe so they can tell them apart when there's more than one, and dvi/dp/hdmi/anything from the 21st century isn't compatible with either monitor or computer. 

poor guy.

anyways, i have been explaining to my wife how well work has been going lately blah blah blah & she thinks it would be a good idea for me to have a ""statement day"" by wearing my nice suit to work to show the managers that i am taking initiative/building my personal brand.  i figure what the heck, i see lots of people walking around in suits all day, they seem to be important people to the company lets go with it.

so here i am today at work wearing my badass full suit & tie on jeans day (didn't get the memo) & everyone on my team secretly thinks i have a job interview for an upper level position in the company after being here for only a few months.  i only know this because my manager asked me what position i was interviewing for today because other people wanted to go for it too.  aka how did he get an interview already & i didn't

ok.

so i decided to join a soccer team suggested by some of my classmates because of it's easiness and beginner players.

well, they lied.

when i got to the field where the team meets, kids (yes *kids* like 10-12) were flipping around and kicking the soccer ball perfectly. 

fast forward to powwowing near a soccer goal: the coach asks how many seasons we had all played so far. the average was 10-15. i've never played before. 

so we start practicing and i'm sucking. my kicks lack power and are mostly off course. i don't know any soccer lingo and when we go to scrimmage at the end, i play defense and mostly lurk around the back, not doing anything while the coach cheers on the kids.

i hold a straight face through practice but when my dad comes to pick me up i start crying (i've been having a rough week) because i suck on the team and i'm surrounded by kids.

when i finally get home, i tell my mom that i want to quit and he gets mad at me and so i go to my room to calm down.

about an hour later she comes into my room and tells me that she got a refund and that i wouldn't have to pay anymore.

but for some stupid reason, i felt kinda bad, like a failure and for putting my parents through all this shat.

and now i have like forty dollars of soccer gear sitting around reminding me of my fuck up.

its christmas eve and my family is poised to go to south padre the next morning for christmas. (my grandparents owned property down there and would go every winter)

keep in mind that i'm around 8 years old at the time. my older sister, age 13, tempted me by saying, ""if you catch me, ill give you a piggy back ride!"" me, being the youngin that i was, was ecstatic for the chance at a piggyback ride. she ended up running around my room with me in hot pursuit. i had a rocking chair in my room at the time (idk why) and she was smart enough to jump over the legs while she was running. i was not. this is where the fuck up happens. i tripped and smacked my head on the corner of the rocking chair leg. i get up, not feeling any pain, and look at my sister. i see her jaw drop and face immediately burst into tears screaming, ""moooomm!!!!""

i look down and notice a nice little puddle of blood by my feet. it was then that i realized what had happened. my mother comes rushing in near mach 3. i still was in shock and felt no pain. she took me to the bathroom and the mirror revealed the horror. the top right side of my forehead was split open and you could see hell inside. 

my parents continued to rush me to the hospital at like 10pm to get stitches while still planning on leaving for our vacation at 5am the next morning. i ended up get 7 stitches in my head after they lowered a hook into the wounded to remove a chunk of wood.

according to my dad, i had a picture of my mom, who was also in the room, with me and i was looking at it for strength during the operation.

input: Text: this happened yesterday before my final written exam for the semester. i hopped off the bus a few streets away from melbourne university in the adjacent restaurant / cafe district so i could get a coffee on my way to the exam venue. i was pre-exam anxious and oblivious to my surroundings as i stuffed my bus pass in my backpack while striding purposefully across the road. i was concentrating on the road traffic, not realising that i was striding straight toward the open rear of an armoured bank truck that was being unloaded with my backpack slung across my chest. its only been a week since paris happened so every uniform with a gun has been edgy in this city, hot on the lookout for a young bearded guy walking quickly toward them with a suspicious looking backpack. it wasn't until thick necked military arm tattoo buzz cut wearing guard 1 had his gun unclipped and alerted guard 2 of my presence that i actually looked up and realised what was going on. with a week of late night study sessions and fitful sleep , i wasn't in the best frame of mind for dealing with a realisation that i was about to be shot - i panicked and ran. in retrospect probably not the smartest move in case one of those dudes had an itchy trigger finger, but i wasn't gonna stick around on exam day to find out.

input: Text: this was a few years ago. my so at the time was coming home from being stationed out of state. i decided to bake him cookies. what a novel idea.  it's the weekend,  i have a few hours before i need to get ready so i'm chilling in a baggy hoodie and sweats. i start throwing ingredients into a plastic bowl. grab the mixer, turn it on....cookie things. this particular bowl was rather lightweight and flimsy but it was doing the job. i can do this,  no big deal. what i failed to consider was the tipsy nature of this particular bowl. i have one hand on the mixer moving it around the batter. one hand on the bowl holding it steady or so i thought. the mixer hits the bowl at a precisely excellent angle proceeding to fling the bowl in my general direction with the mixer still going and heading right towards my chest.  the mixer proceeds to grab the hoodie and boob and twists until it finally has so much fabric and boob it jams. i am at this point lying on the floor crying and laughing at the stupidity of what just happened. i just gave myself a fucking titty twister with an electronic hand mixer...wtf

edit: spelling.

i'm 18,
just taking my first heavy duty programming class.
you know when you learned object oriented programming and linked lists for the first time.
boiled my brain.
anyway, had a big project due as a homework assignment
at college they made it so you could continue to electronically submit the program into the locker until someone physically closed it at 9am the day after it was due.

i had been programing all day and into the night because i am stupid and also i procrastinate.
anyway, it's about 4am, and i start to lose it. all the errors i'm getting are issues i had 8 hours ago.
now i'm really starting to lose it.
i stumble out of the lab, the lab is on campus 
campus is very pretty university of california, 
trees everywhere
nice big baseball bat sized dry branches all over the ground.

so me, a drooling angry skinny 18 computer science major at 4am starts picking up these branches and smashing them into anything i can find.
i was screaming and drooling and snarling.
i was powerful, i was the tree branch destroyer.

well anyway i got all my angst out. 
i stood there, at 4am, breathing heavily, getting up the desire to go back inside and get back to it.
then i turn around.
on the second floor balcony stood a handful of engineering graduates, all in their mid 20's i assume
looking at me.

all they saw was this scrawny little kid screaming and breaking branches.

cops came
no sir i'm fine
i'm just tired.
no sir, i'm just trying to finish my assignment.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i mentioned this story in another tifu and someone asked for the full story.

this occured the summer that my older sister got married. she and i have never gotten along. i wasn't over the moon excited about her wedding because ~~she and her now-husband had slept together while he was still dating me~~ it's complicated. not that i don't adore my boyfriend but it was still a touchy topic. 

she and her then-fiancé were living at his (small) apartment so my parents' house (where i was still living) was sort of the staging area for all of the stuff.

she had chosen this gorgeous and uber-expensive dress with this beautiful lace bodice, and it was hanging in the closet in her old bedroom. now what you have to understand is that after my sister left for college, we started using her room (especially her closet) as a storage for random things like ironing board, extra suitcases. her room is big, so the extra stuff never really bothered her but she never really loved the idea of us going in and out of her room even though she had moved out.

like i said, my mom had it hanging in the closet. there was a sheet loosely draped over the top but it left the bottom foot of the dress exposed. 

this is where i come in. i was seriously sick with a high fever and i got up around 4 and really needed a blanket. so i stumbled next door to my sisters room to grab an extra blanket from her closet. i didn't even turn on the light.

i open up the closet and the blankets are stacked on the high shelf while the dress is taking up the space below. it's at this point that i feel vomit rising up my throat. but in a lucky turn of events, i see an empty rubbermaid shoebox on the floor. i drop to my knees and immediately vomit into it. then i take my box and blanket, dump the contents of box into the toilet, vomit again, and go back to bed. 

next morning i wake up to my sister standing over me looking like she wanted to stab me with a plastic hanger. apparently some of the vomit had escaped the box, and had spent three hours fermenting in her closet next the bottom of the wedding dress. 

she was furious. she didn't think i had done it on purpose but she was incredibly incredibly pissed. she was worried about the stains but the smell too.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: saw something earlier on the front page about forgetting some rotting potatoes, thought i could add my dumbass actions.

i am a native tachilhit speaker, but once i moved to the us when i was young, i got a little bit rusty over the course of a few years due to speaking primarily english at school. 

my grandmother moved in from our native country to visit and stay with us for a few months. she speaks no english but i was easily able to communicate with her, seeing as i am mostly fluent in our language however i do tend to make the occasional flub. 

only my grandmother and i are home and i'm about to leave for a few hours, and she asks me before i go how to make our dinner soup for the night. usually the soups we eat consist of veggies like carrots and cauliflower and other things blended together with potatoes as kind of a base. its primarily potato and carrot. 


so i'm telling her all of the stuff she needs to cook in the pot and i emphasize potatos and carrots because they're the main ingredients. for some reason shes looking at me in this bewildered way, and is asking me ""potatoes? you're sure you need that much potatoes?"" and i tell her yeah its a potato and carrot soup, you need at least four potatoes, trust me its delicious. 
she stares at me and says fine, she trusts me. 

fast forward a few hours later when i get home and the soup is all done and everyone is ready to eat. i get the pot and look inside and i'm just like- what the fuck. 

turns out i completely mixed up the words ""butter"" and ""potato"" in my dialect and instead my grandmother put four to five sticks of butter instead of potatoes.  it was so incredibly greasy and disgusting looking that even thinking about it right now is giving me acne. like two inches of liquid butter just floating on top of the pureed veggies. it was some next- level paula deen shit. 

honestly, i feel like paula deen would have run away scared.

in my defense, potato in my language sounds a lot like the english word butter, so i must have just confused the two in my head. it was terrible. 

we ended up getting shitty chinese food for dinner that ended up giving my brother food poisoning. i'm never allowed to give anyone recipes in any language other than english again.

input: Text: so, i'm an assistant for this doctor who is super down-to-earth. he geeks out hardcore over the same things i do, we share a lot of similar interests/views, and it's really easy to just start having a conversation with him and end up chatting for the better part of an hour.

anyways, we were talking today about the differences in tax laws in different states--sales tax vs income tax, etc etc, pretty mundane stuff. i said someday i would probably return to my home state (oregon), but not the city where i grew up. he laughed and said he has friends in vancouver, washington who have promised to ""sponsor"" him if he ever wants to (in his words) immigrate. i laughed and made a joke about them hiding him under a tarp in their truck to sneak him into washington, and made a comment about using that stuff they doused handkerchiefs with to confuse the dogs when the jews were escaping germany. a bit off-color, but i was just picturing this intelligent, well-spoken, clean-cut guy sneaking into the pacific northwest, and totally wasn't even thinking about the fact that he was, in fact, jewish. 

he laughed it off and made some comment about ""these aren't the droids you're looking for,"" and it wasn't until after i left his office that the horrific realization hit me. now i don't know if i should apologize, or just pretend like it never happened.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this f-up didn't happen today, but few months back. but i can still remember it. okay, so my family decided to house this kid. we thought it would be a great idea since we needed the money (his parents paid us to house him) and thought he was a decent kid. now that i think about it, that was the worst decision my family made. 

first, the kid began to take control of the internet. since we're not that bright at computers (only my older brother was), we literally just watched as he brought havoc into the servers. we got him under control by placing the router in a place where he couldn't reach, but he began plotting (i think he was) the number of ways how to fuck with us. which brings to this event. 

i was working on my english essay, about 90% done. since i was almost done, i decided, ""eh, why don't i celebrate with some games?"" so i started playing. then my youngest brother asked if he can play the game i was playing. since i was in a good mood, i allowed him to use my computer while i went to the restroom. minutes later, i see that brat and my youngest brother arguing. and i see my fucking laptop. blank screen. 

see, that brat and my youngest brother had this argument going on for weeks, and usually the brat won (since he was older than my brother). then we would intervene and beat the crap out of that boy. since then, he's been annoying the hell out of my brother, and i think he literally sneaked behind my brother and pressed the power button. 

anyway, i rushed to my laptop, turned it on, and prayed to anything above the heavens that my document was auto-saved. and there is a reason why i don't trust the thing above the heavens. i find my essay gone. without any saves (i know it was stupid for me to not save while working, that's my f-up). 

and my essay was due tomorrow. 

next thing i know, i'm screaming at the fucking brat, trying to figure out if my fists can fit in his annoying ass. i dropped more f-bombs that day than i did with my entire life. while i am doing so, the kid looks calm as fuck. this enrages me more, but luckily my parents stopped me before i unleashed fury onto his sorry ass. after this, my parents come to a decision that we can't no longer house this brat, and he leaves the next week. oh, and he apparently ""enjoyed his visit."" 

motherfucker said he might come back and visit us during the summer. 

goddammit.

so it all starts earlier today.  i was talking to my so and she made a joke about me picking my nose so much that it's going to bleed one day. ( i really don't do it often, and i know it's gross, but she picks on me about it.) so i tell her whatever and we go about our day.  

later on,  i was alone and i felt the intense need to get a booger that was driving me crazy.  i figured i'm alone and there won't be anyone to judge so i'll take care of it. 

i start getting after the nuisance and successfully extract it but in the process i scrape the inside of my nose.  it didn't hurt too bad so i assumed nothing would come of it.  i assumed wrong.  

within seconds i felt a warm wet feeling going from my nose and then dripping off of my lip.  i put my hand to it and then immediately pulled it back whenever i touched the wetness to see that apparently my nose was bleeding profusely. it took hours of holding my head back and a lot if kleenex to make my nose stop bleeding. and i ruined a nice shirt while trying to stop it.

was doing a bumpy intermediate down hill cycle trail with my dad. bear in mind the track is extremely bumpy, as in, part of the track is missing and you just gotta go with the flow sort of bumpy.

so yeah, i was just going along with it and my ass was slightly sore from the earlier trails.

as i swing round a sharp bend that conjoins the downhill course and the quiet flat course together, pull in to let some other hard core cyclists go past. thinking that was all, i got back on and riding when i heard another bike. oh it's fine it's my dad i thought


so, i proceed to exclaim very loudly ""ahahah dad mah ahnoose, it is hurting"" in a very strange foreign accent.

so the person checking him in asks the obligatory questions, including ""do you have any explosives in your bag?""

my friend/dickhead thought it would be funny to say ""yes."" he was laughing and smiling at the time but in light of recent events the lady obviously didn't find it funny.

he missed his flight, missed his trip, and is now a convicted terrorist which (can) restrict even what countries he can fly over.

anyway, the padding was just a little crumpled, so i had to try to readjust it by stretching out the cups a little.  well, as it turns out, the fabric on this particular over-the-shoulder-boulder-holder (thanks bette midler for that particular term) is actually pretty slippery, and as i was looking down and pulling hard on one of the cups to stretch it out, my hand slipped and i punched myself knuckle-first right in the face.  i felt my teeth knock together, and one of the bottom ones is definitely a little loose now.  :(  i considered making something up to tell my dentist, but if it comes to that i think i'll just tell him the truth.  fuck it, it's kinda funny.

lesson learned: hand-wash your bras, or at least don't stretch those cups out *while* you're wearing them.  :sigh:

input: Text: so this happened about 2 weeks ago over my fall break from university. i had gone out with some friends to pizza hut the night before this incident, and i got bread sticks and ended up not finishing them, so i asked the waiter for a box. i put the garlicy bread sticks away and thought nothing else of them until the next day when i wanted something to munch on. so i pulled the box of bread sticks out of the fridge and threw them in the microwave, set the microwave to the popcorn setting, and then went to the bathroom. as i was sitting in the bathroom doing my business and looking at my phone, i started to smell something burn. i kind of just blew it off and continued to browse reddit. i eventually finished up, washed my hands, and went into the kitchen... when i walked through that door i was flabbergasted by the smoke in the room and the flames spewing out of the bread stick box in the microwave. i started to panic and just started yelling fire like an idiot. (no one else was home at the time...) i then ran to the sink, falling twice in the process, and filled up a cup with water. i then bravely grabbed the microwave handle and flung the door open. i splashed the cup of water on the bread sticks which immediately put the fire out, crisis averted, but i was so confused on how the fire started. as i took the charred box of bread sticks out of the microwave, which was now covered in a smelly black smoke residue , i noticed that the box i got for the bread sticks had a piece of tinfoil in it... the whole house smelled like a burnt garlic asshole for the next two days... all because i didn't check the box for a small piece of tinfoil.

input: Text: tifu. happened today, a couple of hours ago. i got an unexpected early dart from work getting to leave an hour earlier, which was great for me as i could get to go and see my kids, and my mum who lives in york (i live in birkenhead. if you know the place you'll understand what a wretched town this is). anyway, i digress.
i'm walking through town and see this guy walking towards me and his expression just went completely blank, his hands fell to his waist and he just went, i mean like, bang, flat out straight forward, face first, gone. i'm a trained first aider, it just kicked in and i was over to him. i got down on my knees to do a quick assessment and asked a bystander to call an ambulance. his eyebrow was split wide open and there was a bad cut along his eyelid and he'd gone into seizure, i didn't want to even attempt to move him but he face face down in a pool of blood and was obviously unable to breathe so i moved his head very carefully and slid some tissue a bystander had given me underneath his cheek just to get his mouth and nose to a point where he could breathe, put a coat over him and wait, and hope, for his seizure to end.
i felt that his muscles had relaxed, i needed to get him in the recovery position, but he had a rucksack on his back. i undid the straps, removed it and started to move him, he went into seizure again, now when i'm doing all this i noticed someone else walking towards us, i look down again at my patient and suddenly, this guy walks past and takes my glasses (i had them raised as it was raining and it was just blocking my vision) right off my fucking head, and just keeps walking off! i was so shocked, and in disbelief i just sat there on the floor with this guy i'm trying to take care of, that i didn't say anything, i don't know if anybody else saw him do it, but nobody said anything and i just carried on trying to do what i was doing. i got him into the recovery position with the help of some security staff and their first aider gave us a foil blanket to cover him with, we even managed to get some cardboard which was carefully slipped underneath him to get him away from the cold wet floor and i started to clean up the area around his wound.
the police and paramedics arrived and i started handing over to the professionals, i didn't even think to tell the police about this guy stealing my glasses after i'd handed over to them and i just carried on my way home.

input: Text: ok, first off, this didn't happen today. this happened a good 10 or 11 years ago, when creamsavers actually still existed. i was around 7 at the time.

me and a buddy of mine were playing tekken 3, minding our own business. my sister was sitting on the couch behind us, enjoying a bag of creamsavers. now, like any wide-eyed kid growing up in the early 2000s, i was unhealthily addicted to video games. to the point where i'd literally blot out anything else going on around me. my friend was the same way. we would never take our eyes off of the screen until we were finished. 

so, this proved extremely bad for my sister, who chose the worst time ever to choke on something. a creamsaver had gone down the wrong pipe, and she was gasping for air before she knew it. of course, i didn't know this, because i was too immersed in playstation to acknowledge anything going on behind me. even when my sister got up, slapped both me and my friend on the back, and tried to get our attention by reaching for our game controllers, we ignored her. finally, she did the only thing she could think of- she flung herself onto the couch. impossibly, the creamsaver came loose and she coughed it out of her mouth. 

i didn't even realize what had happened until my grandmother walked in and pointed out that my sister was crying. needless to say, i didn't hear the end of it for a long time.

this happened a few weeks ago.
so at our school we have cooking as subject, it is amazing.
we cook obviously in the kitchen and we work together and stuff, and we all have a partner to cook with, and that partner for me is my friend (let's call him bill) and bill is fairly overweight, and quite immature.
so one day we were just making these chicken burgers and he got a bigger piece of chicken than me, so he could not resist saying: ""haha, my piece of chicken is bigger than yours, just like something else.."" and without thinking i blurted out: ""like what? your body fat percentage?"" the silence was deafening afterwards in the kitchen because everyone heard and some people then went like: ""oh burn."" we are still friends and laugh about it sometimes.

input: Text: so, a little backstory, my sister's doctoral thesis got published through a small university press--one of those ""technically yes it's in print, but nobody's expecting anyone to actually buy it"" type of deals. so, one night a year or so ago, i found it on amazon(i had to spend around an hour looking for it) and proceeded to drunkenly leave the following review(i've already deleted the review from amazon):

title: ""this book raped my children""

""this book gave me cancer of the ass. and also, it made me a racist.""

so, i figured my sister would be the only one that would ever have any reason to look at that page, and it would be a funny joke--she loves off-color jokes, so why not?

by now, i've forgotten all about this little stupid joke, but it turns out she wasn't the only author of the book. she co-wrote it with a friend of hers, who only just now saw fit to look the page up, and seeing my ""joke,"" has apparently been in tears all night long.

so yeah, today i fucked up.

as you all probably know, this week is finals week for many college students. and for the past week, i have studied all day every day for my upcoming exams. and this whole week, i was under the impression that all my exams were on thursday, april 30th, which is today. my first exam? calculus ii at 8:00 am sharp. i wake up at 7, get dressed, and head out with two pencils, an eraser, and my brain. i reach the classroom at approximately 7:55 am, and i go to open the door... dark room with nothing but the sound of cars passing by outside. i immediately think to myself, ""is this a dream?"". i was so sure that the final was on thursday that for the next ten minutes or so i run around campus like a crazy person thinking i had the wrong room. but oh, if only. after running like a maniac, i check my syllabus and it turns out that the final is on wednesday april 29th. which is yesterday. it was as if someone had shoved their hand down my mouth, pulled out my intestines and choked me with them. i am now sitting at the library typing this out. i do not know what to do. all semester i worked hard, i did all my homework, got as on all my tests, and did well on all the quizzes. but missing this final, (which is 40% of our grade) has failed me the course. i have emailed my professor explaining the situation, and i will go and meet with him tomorrow to see if there is something i can do. but i am bracing myself for the worst: a big f on my transcript and another $1000+ for a course i already took. sigh.

edit: he responded and told me i can make it up tomorrow morning! :d

after stretching out and nearly settling nicely into dreamland, i notice my ankle is itchy. i give it a good scratch with my toenail from my other foot. ah, that's better.

now it feels wet. what the hell. being a warm night, i assume it is sweat and try to go to sleep. 

soon, my ankle is soaked. i get up and stumble to the bathroom. i switch the light on and notice a ketchup stain on the wall. ""how the fuck did that get there?"" i wonder. 

i look down and my ankle and foot are covered in blood. what's worse is the fact that my ankle is *pissing out a fucking horizontal stream of blood*. i proceed to plug the hole with one finger, and call my girlfriend, all whilst acting like a wounded soldier on omaha beach. i roll on to my back, bawling on the phone to my girlfriend, and realize my apartment looks like a murder scene. my pressure hose ankle has sprayed blood all over my white walls.

i lay on my back for a good 15 mins, trying to get the blood to stop. legit thought i had somehow contracted haemophilia and this was the end. but naturally, the bleeding eventually subsided and i cleaned all the goddamn blood off my walls.


now, with my ankle covered in bandaids and a big ass sock, i'm trying to get back to sleep and feeling like a buffoon for scaring the crap out of my poor girlfriend.

input: Text: our tale begins last night. i was up late studying for a big exam today, and like any hardworking college student, i was also drinking a fair amount too. i finally feel both prepared for the exam and like passing out around 4am. 

woke up at 6am, got ready, and took the bus to campus while feeling like death. somehow manage to make it through the exam and honestly, i think i either aced it or failed spectacularly because i felt like i was doing everything right. 

because this is the only class i have on thursdays after i'd finished i went over to the bus stop to head home and take a nap. the bus stop itself has 8 benches and 1 picnic table. there was a guy on one bench, a girl on another, and me (way off to the far side away from where the bus actually stops and furthest away from the buildings). besides that, it was empty (this is a horrible diagram of what the bus stop roundabout looks like: http://i.imgur.com/vd4jad0.png). so, i'm a zombie at this point so i'm just completely zoned out listening to music. 

then, this random person comes and sits right next to me. i don't bother looking over, i figure its some socially awkward fucktard (encountered more than enough at my college) and i just ignore them the ten or so minutes until the bus arrived. once it gets there we stand up and start walking over to where it stopped (in front of the two green stars on my diagram) and i finally look over to see who was sitting next to me. to my dismay it was an absolutely gorgeous girl. a beautiful girl went well out of her (looking at the diagram, she would have had to walk from the right side passed all over the open benches/table to get to me) way to sit right fucking next to me and i just straight up ignored her without even a glance. i'm the socially awkward fucktard. and if i could imagine that i just misread the situation, the absolutely shitty look she gave me when we were getting on the bus pretty much confirmed it.

today, while rushing through inspections and annoyed at my coworker for being annoying, i grabbed an extinguisher out of a bracket and, without first checking that the zip tie and safety pin were in place (they weren't), turned it upside down, looked directly at the hose and the weight of the extinguisher being upside down closed the trigger.

sprayed the thing point-blank, directly onto my face, up my nose, into my mouth and in my eyes.  

coworker called it in to public safety over the radio and reported it as that i ""shot myself in the face (long pause)...with a fire extinguisher"", so for a few seconds everyone in my department thought i had been shot, by a gun, in the face.

i was taken over to the health center to get checked out, but unfortunately they couldn't prescribe anything for the severe embarrassment and desire to crawl into a hole and die.  hurry up, friday!

so i was trying to add a storage device between my computer which in turn fucked up my other storage device. i managed to eventually get on my computer and as it was loading i thoght like the idiot i am, ""lol the fans on top spins fast what happens if i put something on it"" (the top of the case is easily detachable) so i placed a screw on it and it flew off and hit me in the chest. i thought this was fucking hilarious so i placed a medal i won earlier this year (discus :d) on it. the medal flew off alright, into the computer itself and smacked my motherboard. keep in mind my computer was on the whole time, so my computer went dead. i thought my computer was gone. to add salt to the wound it was my first computer build i did 2 days ago. i went into panic mode and started digging around the inside of my computer, smacking my hand off a spinning fan. that fucking hurt. i dug the medal out and turned my computer back on, only to be greeted with a black screen. reboot. black screen. plug off. reboot. i was able to launch the computer but it went to a black screen. reboot. it took 10 mins but the computer got loaded and it is now ok. it is a bit slow but at least it works. during this time i was having a mild panic attack so things weren't exactly smooth, but hey, at least it's all good now. the fuck-up has been counter-fucked-up? meh, idc i blame myself for almost breaking my computer.


 


edit: my motherboard now smells like its burning. smell has gone away now but had mild panic attack #2.

i am on two adhd medications. straterra and concerta, straterra, although not helping me, reduced my anxiety, concerta however helps a lot but can increase my anxiety. however, i have also started using meditation techniques to get my anxiety under control.

i was on a skype call with my parents as i tried to explain it to them and said, ""i want to try going off straterra for a while and see if it effects my anxiety, also, i have had my anxiety under control ever since i also started using masturbation techniques.""

input: Text: so this happened before reddit was a thing, but i just remembered it watching an episode of community.

i was in a car with a girl i really liked, a white 91 firebird. i was looking for a pen in the glove box and found instead a little pink mace spray.

i laughed and asked her if she'd ever used it. she said no, and being curious i asked if i could test it out. she said sure, so i rolled the window down a little bit and stuck it out and pressed the button.

i was young and stupid at the time and didn't exactly predict the wind dynamics.

we both started coughing, crying, and she immediately had to pull the car over, causing the car behind us to honk & swerve around us.

we had to wait like 15 minutes before getting back on the road and we didn't have any water to help rinse.

i lit my lighter a few inches from my face and slowly brought it close until i successfully burnt the hair from my cheek. problem solved. except that's not what really happened.

i pressed the lighter against my face and lit it. the flame was a little taller than i expected and half my eye lashes were removed as the other half turned bright white.

input: Text: so this fuckup actually happened a few days ago. many apologies, yadda yadda yadda... here's a bit of a prologue; several months ago i bought a bottle of hot sauce off the internet, one of the hottest in the world in fact. this is the kind of hot sauce which stops all control over snot and saliva, the kind of sauce which leaves your tongue feeling battered and pillaged with no recollection of what's gone before. i had bought it with the intention of pranking my flatmates, which may have been my first mistake. fast forward to last weekend when me and some friends were going out for a night in typical student fashion. the night passed without issue and soon it was time to leave. we returned home and sat in the living room eating the customary post-night out pizza. one flat mate, say x, decided to go to bed. me and another flat mate, y, stayed up chatting and listening to some tunes. soon, we too decided to call it a night. its worth noting that i had my duvet in the living room at the time and then carried it back through to my room. next i went for the usual pre-bed pee before returning to by room...which was covered in hot sauce!! the sheets, the wall, the floor. turns out x had poured some over the door handle to my room and the light switch also. good potential for a prank, but of course i'll remember its there and avoid any contact. then, a knock on my door. y had misplaced their keys on the night out and couldn't get back into their room. being the upstanding gentleman i am, i offered up my bed while i was to sleep on the couch. midway through our conversation however, i felt a tingling downstairs...surely not! it got hotter and hotter still and sure enough, i had hot sauce on my member! like all over. it was burning so bad, with the heat of a billion suns. it felt like the devil himself was trying to emerge from my chap much like the genie in aladdin. this was bad! i ran to the shower and stood, naked and afraid for an hour, washing as much sauce off as i could. i wasn't able to use my hands though, as they were themselves covered in sauce residue, which while mostly invisible, was certainly still there. eventually i left the shower, noticing that the sun was coming up. with my room no longer available and nowhere else to go, i slept on the couch in nothing but a damp towel while the remains of the hot sauce still ravaged my gentlemen's sausage. i tried to sleep but the pain was just intolerable. it eventually faded hours later. i have since spent the last week re-painting my walls and washing my sheets/towel several times, yet this sauce just will not budge...fuck me right?!

input: Text: nsfw

obligatory didn't happen today but last week.

i’m a bath kind of person – i like to put on music and wallow in a steaming hot bath for ages until i am a human prune. pretty average bath everything is going smoothly and i was really getting into a relaxed mood, so as i stepped out i thought, ‘you deserve some self-love, dude. you’re worth it’, so i get out my razor and shaving cream and i put on some tunes on my loudspeaker and started to shave my legs and armpits whilst dancing around and generally having a great time. all good so far, and i should’ve stopped there, but no. 

i looked down at my vagina and i was surprised to see my pubes going a bit awry. now, i don’t shave my pubes because i get razor burn and i am prone to vaginal infections so i have to keep some of my pubic hair just in case, but i like to keep it neat and trimmed for my personal satisfaction and my boyfriend’s sake. so, i pick up my scissors and begin to trim at the front of my vagina. 

halfway through this the song on my speaker changes to this banging rock piece and i’m like ‘hell fucking yes this is the life’. i keep trimming the front and decide i don’t wanna stop the song, so i move round to the vaginal flaps and begin to trim to the beat of this song.
 
all of a sudden i feel the scissors get stuck for a second then snap closed, and immediately afterwards i am blinded by this pain from my nether region. i felt pain shoot down my leg and all over my vagina and i look down to see blood spilling down my leg and dripping on the floor. i also cannot deal with blood so i am nauseous, in excruciating pain and bleeding heavily. i look around for some toilet paper and realise i don’t have any so i drag my sorry ass to the closest box of tissues, all whilst bleeding all over my damn house, and try to make the bleeding stop. i also live with my parents if anyone was wondering why i didn't use a towel, and it'd be pretty difficult to explain why i got blood all over their lovely expensive towels. after about 15 mins of lying on the floor groaning in pain i feel well enough to try to clear some of the blood that i’d trekked from my bathroom to the kitchen and i thank every existing god that we have vinyl flooring. 

i managed to clear it up with one hand (the other holding tissues to my vag) and get upstairs to apply some cream. after a day or so the pain eased but i will now have a scar on my vagina forever.

input: Text: this was about a week ago. i work at a local bicycle shop (pedal bikes not motorcycles) and was dealing with a middle aged man who was looking for a little kid's bike.
as part of my routine i ask how old is your child, is he small or big for his age, what's your price range, etc. well, he said it was for his secretary's son. he was getting it for her as a gift to show his appreciation for all her hard work. i thought it was cute and he sounded sincere (not at all like he was banging the chick).
he bought a bike and through our procedure i'm supposed to take down the serial number of the bike for our records; it's a legitimate law we have to follow... i forgot to take it down and the bike was gone by the time i remembered.
this is where is gets bad. i have the gentleman's number so i decide to call him and see if he can read it to me over the phone. the number i call is answered by a woman, it didn't surprise me because the man who bought the bike had a wedding ring. i kindly ask her if her husband is home. he's not. so i ask if the bike is at the house and if she could give me the serial number.
""what bike?""
without even thinking i said, ""the one your husband bought for his secretary?""
she has no idea what i was talking about. her husband never said anything to her and i could tell she was getting angry. i felt horrible. did i just unintentionally break up this marriage? 


update: finally got a call back from the gentleman today. he sounded happy on the phone and mentioned his wife hadn't known he was getting the bike. duh! i apologized for calling his home and he said, ""you were fine, just doing your job. my wife was confused because she knew i was getting my secretary a gift but she didn't know it was going to be a bicycle for her son."" so it seems that everything is okay:) i don't feel so bad. even though i'm at work i thought you guys would like to know the call i got :)

when i was little, i liked to take a pencil and sharpen it until it was really small. i don't know why, but it amused me. fast forward until about half an hour ago, when i was cleaning my living room.

under the couch, i found one of these tiny pencils. it reminded me of when i was little, so you know what i decided to do? stick it in my electric pencil sharpener. 

i grabbed the sharpener, and jammed the pencil in the most it would go. turns out it was so small, it fit in the hole entirely. with no way to get it out.

i unplugged the sharpener, and tried, with no avail, to take the pencil out. i thought i might be able to reach it from underneath, so i removed the container with the pencil shavings. of course, i spilled that all over my leg, so now my leg has a giant graphite stain on it.

then, i took two more pencils, and tried to pry the tiny one out of the sharpener with the lead, like a game of operation. they were cheap pencils, so the lead of both broke, and now they're also stuck in the sharpener.

input: Text: actually last summer, but a fuck up nonetheless.
as any self-respecting miata owner should do, i drove several hours just to drive on another road. i drove from atlanta to the ""tail of the dragon"" in northern tennessee because it is one of the best driver's roads in the country, something like 320 curves in about 11 miles. my friend and i toughed out the nearly unbearable 4 hour drive in one of the bumpiest cars, without air conditioning, and only one functioning like 6 inch speaker. but it was all going to worth it, and it sure was. the road was incredible and the car handled better than i could have imagined. here comes the fuck up, we stop at a scenic over look to get some drinks out of the trunk. we enjoy some lukewarm water and snap some instagram pictures of the view. we are ready to hit the road again so we return to the trunk to put the drinks away. at this point, my heart completely sank. na miatas do not have a trunk open button inside the car or on the trunk itself. the only way to open it is to insert the key. i desperately searched all of the little parking lot and realized that the keys had to be in the trunk. keep in mind, i am in the mountains of tennessee, 4 hours away from the spare keys at my house, and with spotty cell phone service. i really did not want to just break the lock but that was seeming to be the only option. some motorcyclist stopped by and asked us what was going on, and he ended up lending us one wrench, that had a 14mm socket on one side and a 17mm socket on the other that was from his on-board toolkit. the interior of my miata has no carpet, because racecar, so we started removing bolts from the rear deck. luckily, all of the bolts were 14/17mm. after removing a massive piece of metal, that went across the entire rear deck, a like 6 inch diameter hole to the trunk was revealed. both my friend and i are far from twigs, we could barely reach our arms into the trunk. we are like an hour and a half into this, dripping in sweat, and borderline crying. we have run out of options. here comes anorexic biker chick with arms the width of a drinking straw. ""do you guys need any help?"" next thing you know, i'm holding her helmet while she is squeezing her arm into the hole to the trunk. her literal first words were ""i can't feel them but this hoodie is in the way."" she proceeds to pull the hoodie out, toss it to my friend, and the keys fell out of it. i have never been so relieved. we thank her and she goes on her way, not realizing that she just saved me more trouble than i could imagine. 
of my whole time driving, i have never locked my keys in my car or in this case the trunk, and this was probably the worst possible place for it to happen.

input: Text: one day i realy fucked up!
it is some years ago now, but i've been encouraged to write this hilarious story down ...

i work at an amusement park. this day i steered the carousel ""spinning wild pendulum"". where people are sitting on a ""platter"", which spins around and hovers like a pendulum back and forth in the air. something like this one, only with a floor to place the feets:
[imgur](http://i.imgur.com/vqslg7u.jpg)

people vomit all the time in this attraction… this day a person vomited on the floor. i did not want to touch the vomit, so i decided to be creative. i took 5 buckets of chlorine mixed water and threw this on the ground to flush away the vomit. the problem was that the all if the vomit-mixed-chlorine water, remained firmly under the machine ... how would i wipe this away?

i was creative. smart i believed. if i started the machine, then everything's will dry or atleast flow away to the ground? i had to get this done fast. because a large queue of people was in line to take the attraction. so i puched the start button. the pendulum went up slightly. nothing happened. so it went higher. nothing happened. so everything went fast; the pendulum was high and the ""plate"" began to spin around its axis. then the biggest fuck-up of my life happened! vomit and chlorine filled water splashed around and got thrown away in the air! for a ten-meter radius it squirted vomit and chlorinated water around the amusement park! 

there was a stampede unmatched around the attraction, i panicked and people ran dirty of vomit and chlorinated-water away from the carousel! some people, not even knowing it was vomit filled chlorinated water splashing around the carousel, even enjoyed the whole show!

input: Text: this happened two months ago. 

being the antisocial geek i am, i was cooking with my mother. we were making meatball soup, and my task was to chop celery. i made the mistake of holding the vegetable above the cutting board.

when i sliced into the celery, i also sliced right into my left pointer finger. it didn't hurt that much; it was more shocking than anything. that said, it was bleeding profusely, so my mother told me to put pressure on the wound with a paper towel.

no matter what we did, it would. not. stop. bleeding. my mother drove me to the emergency room, where i was given a temporary dressing. my vital signs were also taken.

it's worth noting that this was my second time in the er. when i was a baby, i got very sick, and was there before being admitted. but that's a story for another day.

i was soon seen and taken into the smaller room. after being sat down on the bed, i was told that i needed stitches. the stitches themselves didn't hurt, since i was given a numbing injection.

for the next few days, i had to wear a glove on my left hand so that i didn't wash it. i also had to bathe, not shower, and make sure to keep my hands out of the water. i couldn't risk getting my stitches wet, which could reopen the wound. it wasn't a fun few days, although thankfully i could still type.

eleven days later, i had to get the stitches taken out. *that* hurt like a bitch.

""turn the stove on high and let the pan get very hot before you put your steak in. put in a little bit of oil 30 seconds before gently placing the steak in the pan. careful not to splash any hot oil.""

i did exactly this. carefully placed the steak in the pan. that didn't stop the grease from exploding on to me. to make things even more fun, i was cooking without a shirt on. i now have terrible burns all over my abdomen. it feels like a sunburn x 10. lesson learned.

input: Text: so this happened about a year ago.

i was in a college persuasion and rhetoric class. half the time i don't even know what my teacher is saying i think he was high and would just ramble on about random stuff. 

for homework we had to read this article about a vietnam memorial it wasn't very interesting. also for the next class we were going on a field trip to a memorial. i thought oh ok we are going to a vietnam memorial. 

i was wrong ..

i go to school in boston and the famous memorial we were going to was the holocaust memorial by haymarket. i have never been there or even know it existed. i was still thinking it was going to be a vietnam memorial.

so it was a foggy day, and the memorial makes steam come up for effect.it was very foggy and steamy almost couldn't see. we are about to enter the memorial and i say.

""man i hope we don't get gassed in here"" 

it was dead silent. the kid nested to me slowly turns to me. i look at him still unaware of what i actually said he saids 

""dude what the fuck!? that's not funny at all"".

i look at him like uhhh alright ? then i realize as we get closer that it was a holocaust memorial. i go into a panic in thinking everyone must have heard me and no everyone thinks i'm a dick bag and hates me. 

i kept my distance from everyone until it was time to leave. i haven't had anxiety like that since.

i drove over to sportsman's warehouse to buy cleaning supplies for my gun. my girlfriend was with me. turns out i didn't have my wallet where i thought it was, so i had to go home. as i was driving home, i think i was moving my phone out from underneath my gun, so i had put it on my lap. 

all of a sudden, pop! i was stunned. this couldn't be happening to me. but, there was a lot of blood pouring out of my leg, so we started screaming. i kept screaming for my girlfriend to call 911, as i drove into a parking lot (i don't know why i needed to park). i knew there was a femoral artery right in the general area of where i got shot, so i really thought i might be dying because of a stupid fucking self-inflicted accident. 

the ambulance came and took me to the hospital, where they did some x-rays and told me that it did not hit my femoral or my bone. i honestly am lucky to be alive right now.

the third and final dumb thing i did, was attempt to go down this hill while riding my skateboard, without a helmet, and drinking a monster.

 so this incident occurs outside of the campuses med center, as there is this really nice hill. i was going pretty fast, and my board was starting to wobble. now.. the thing was, i jump off my board! i'm running for a bit, still holding my monster, then fall, throwing my monster can away and catching my self with my hands and one side. now i don't feel the pain at first, but when inspecting the damage, i had a nice like road burn type scratch on the upper right side of like, my crotch area, but on my hip. i had two identical scrape like things, one on the side of my upper hip, but below my tummy, and the other on my elbow, i had another scratch also on my elbow. 

now being on the weekend i wasn't able to go there as they were closed, so i just braved it and limped myself back to my dorm room, and soon afterwords, i went to the campus store and bought some bandaids and neosporin. after like, a few months the wounds healed, the scrape on my upper side hip has a scar. of course, there was a hole in the crotch of my pants and my pair of gloves, which, praise the lord, i was wearing when i fell, becuase those suckers, gained a hole in them.

looking back on it now, i probably could have easily sustained a head wound, or been knocked out. after that incident i never really could ride my skateboard the same.

input: Text: as with most this happened years back. i was in boy scouts in junior high and we went on a trip backpacking by lake superior. one of the days we wanted to kill some time so we went into this small tourist town to get some things and went poking around the lake.

by lake superior people will often stack the smoothed rocks and create art and towers balancing the rocks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/l1b19ih.png) sometimes getting them to be 6 to 7 feet high. 

so we come across a beach full of these rock towers. being dumb young kids we don't know any better and think these would be fun to knock over. so we proceed to kick over and throw rocks at these stacks until none of them were left standing. we then make our way back to the suburban to wait for the rest of the group. 

in the meantime a bunch of yuppie art people were pulling up to this beach to look at these stacks and finding them all knocked over. eventually they figured out it was us because someone saw us and we got reamed out for destroying creations that took artists weeks to create.

input: Text: obligatory this didn't happen today but rather last weekend. 

my so and i were invited over to our friend's fuck-buddies house (lets call him jake) to have some drinks and play some cards. we arrive and all is well, some shots are poured and everyone is feeling good. 

the night turned sour when our friend pulled my so aside to tell her that her other fuck buddy(lets call him mark) was going to be in town, and that jake can't know, so don't tell him because he hates mark with a living passion and will kill him on sight (yes they know about each other, i never said my friend was smart). she also asked if mark could stay at our place while he was in town, which i obliged to. 

eventually we reach a point in the evening where it was just us guys sitting around the table while the girls were upstairs talking. me in my slightly buzzed state of mind looks over at jake and says (que fuck up), ""hey man, you should know that mark is coming into town. but don't worry he's not gonna stay with her because he's staying at my place i got you bro"". jake did not take this well (he was drunk and also has anger management problems i find out). fast forward through a bunch of bullshit, and jake and our friend have been up in the bedroom for quiet a while talking about the situation, both drunk as hell. eventually he comes downstairs, grabs the bottle of jim beam, and chugs the rest. he proceeds to look at us and say ""i think i fucked up"". apparently he was referring to what happened while he was upstairs with our friend. they had decided to have sex to avoid having a rough conversation, and he tried to slip it somewhere she was not expecting. she started crying. 

fast forward even further and we had taken our friend back to our place because she is extremely distraught and drunk from the nights events. she grabs an uber and goes to the bar that jake and everyone else had gone to. she finds jake passed out in the parking lot, and calls us to ask if we knew if he had taken his insulin that evening. he didn't. this proved to be a problem since he had chugged who knows how many beers, taken who knows how many shots, and chugged that bottle of jim beam. all because i pissed him off by telling him something he should not have known about. 

he is taken to the er and is in critical condition when he arrives. 
luckily they were able to stabilize him. 

i feel like an ass.

*latest update: 08.15*

 


so the result of yesterday.  i don't know if the data has been shredded yet, but it's at a company that we are heading to this morning.  no-one was there last night.  the rest of the team know, and 'jim' is in as much shit as me; 4 hds were empty of data but rammed full of cocaine.  dave is…still along for the ride at least.

there was a couple of people telling me i'm fucked and the others would eventually reveal all.  me and dave are very good friends (i was best man at his wedding), and worked together years ago before the firm we're at now, so there's no worries there.  i was a little worried about jim to be honest but well he wants this sorted as much as me now.  even if i come clean to the bosses; it might be too late.  that's 5 years worth of data there, some of the stuff before at least will be on tapes but half of them were chucked as well (that was on purpose though).

btw; the banging on the door this morning at 4 am?  dave.  him and sofia had some argument and he chucked her out.  sorry, i thought it was some goons and we were done for right there.

so the plan as of right now (10:15) is we head off to look things up and see what we can get.  if that means breaking and entering that's what we do.  too much at stake here.  figured i would keep reddit updated on our travels.  jim's driving.  any suggestions on how to get in without getting arrested too would be good.  hoping just to trip an alarm and then get someone to come out for us and we can explain the situation.  i hope you appreciate that i can't tell you where we're going or coming from (other than near the east coast, guess you can figure that out from the times), but i'll try to keep putting on a couple of pictures as i go along.

**tl;dr still fucked up so going on for all or nothing.  plus, we're all super hungover.  hold on tight.**

*edit 1 (11.13):* being followed, doing zig-zags and driving erratically to try to lose the pi.  haha joking.  we're on the interstate, about 50 mins to go.

*edit 2 (12.49):* bit delayed with traffic but scoped out the place. round the back of the building there's a keypad for a large door entrance. tried a few obvious combos. any recommendations? we like the suggestion of /u/malamutewhisperer gonna try some linked in and facebook attempts.

*edit 3 (12.55):* images of keypad and yard http://m.imgur.com/bt3n6f5,d2tbxfq

*edit 4 (14.43):* **jim in jail**. big update when we get a coffee and figure out what the fuck is going on. oh and yeah. jim was our lift here.

*edit 5 (15.32):* so. we found our way in, the digits were the last 4 of the company number. no alarm! and we saw the shredder. it's huge, i've seen similar on youtube videos i think, will try to find one later. there's boxes of stuff to go in, and no evidence of any shreddings. but i don't recognise the crap they had piled up there. here's the twist; jim went out to get one of these things http://www.mrshelf.co.za/shop/hand-trolleys/crate-trolley/ (a crate trolley?) from his trunk. but we'd parked up next to a hydrant...paying too much attention i guess to the task in hand. he's getting written up, but he must have looked nervous or something because all of a sudden he's getting patted down and they're giving the car a quick sweep. i don't know what they found but next thing we know he's in the back of a car on the way to the station we guess. will update when we know about him.

we cleared the hell out of there. now in a starbucks thinking how the fuck we make it 100 miles back home on a sunday.

*edit 6 (20.10):* sorry for such a long delay. my iphone battery died. so we hitch-hiked back. didn't realise anyone did that anymore but hell we made it. grabbed a taxi the last few miles back. now we're at the office trying to get things sorted. still not heard from jim. but did hear from my boss who left me a message; he wants to meet tomorrow at 14.15 after lunch. fuck. gonna have to come clean reddit. rip in pieces :(

*edit 7 (21:01):* so dave's wife (mrs d) found out and he's been chucked on the streets (it's about 38 degrees here).  he's staying at my place tonight.  apparently last night the big argument he had was that he decided not to leave his wife, that he wanted to make it work.  things did not go down well there with sofia and she completely flipped, chucked him out and that's why he was banging on the door at 4 am.  but i guess in the mean time she wrote a letter to his wife and posted it.  that's when the shit hit home.  mrs d tore him a new one, then it turns out that she didn't go home to see her mom, but went away with some guy!!  that's all i know so far.  dave knows about these threads so i'll let him post any more if he wants.

the shredder was something similar to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvbpfpst78g&t=85

**a bit of a background**: i am a foreigner living in mexico since  years ago. i've got myself a nice mexican girlfriend and she comes from a very reserved and old fashioned family, she lives with her mother, father and 1 of her two brothers. we have been dating for a little over a year and ever since i've lived alone so she is constantly at my home, and recently moved to a new apartment. 



**last weekend** first week in the new apartment and i have about 5 bags of trash, mostly from stuff i bought, it is friday and turns out the trash truck only comes to this area on mondays, so my girlfriend suggest me dumping it at her place, they have it collected on saturdays, i agree.

so later that day i take her home and dump my trash in a big barrel on their back yard.

the next day when i go to her home to pick her up to go out she runs into the car and let me know we have to go immediately, weird because i usually go in and say hi first.

turns out their dog ripped off the bags and made a mess out of my trash in they back yard, the big issue: when moving i took everything in my room to trow it 'later' and in those bags i had put a small bag full of empty boxes of condoms, about 10 or 12, no kidding, i usually just threw away the condom itself but let the box in my knight table next to the bed inside a drawer that is specifically for condoms.

turns out her mother woke up early that day ad begun picking up after the dog's mess and found them, then told her she found some condoms ""lots of them and even some box that said vibrating ring"" and that she would need to talk to me about it.

it has been 1 week already and i haven't been at her house.

input: Text: so this tifu actually did happen today (technically). so in the late hours of the night/early hours of the morning (around 1 a.m.) i was trying to fix a broken phone case with my go to repair tool, krazy glue. i realized that the tube i was using was empty so i went to search for another one, i found one which seemed to be pretty old but it still had glue in it so i decided to try it. when i tried to squeeze the glue out it seemed that there was some dry glue blocking the nozzle (this was the type i was using: https://imgur.com/gallery/uywgx) so i tried squeezing harder, and nothing, i twisted the tube and even bent it and eventually i was about to give up but then i heard a “pop” and i thought i had finally gotten it to budge. that was until i felt the burning sensation on my fingers and pretty much the entire right side of my left shin and a little bit of my thigh. turns out i twisted it too much and caused the entire side of the tube to burst. now in case you didn’t know, crazy glue gets pretty hot as it dries, not enough to cause serious burns, but still pretty uncomfortable. after it stopped burning i thought that was it, i’d just get up and go wash it off quick, but when i went to get up i felt some of the worst pain i’ve ever felt. see, i have never shaved my legs in my life, so when it spilled it basically glued half of the hairs on my leg to each other. so basically any leg movement was impossible without extreme pain due to all of my hair pulling on itself. i eventually hobbled my way up the stairs to my bathroom and turned on the shower, i stayed in the shower for about half an hour and almost none of the glue dissolved, so i went back to my room and tried to think of ways to get the glue off my leg, i came up blank and decided i had only one, very painful course of action. so for about the next 20 minutes i sat on my bed pulling out hairs which were glued to both my skin, and other hairs, one by one while yelling every profanity in my vocabulary. i ended up even causing a bit of bleeding, i just woke up now to realize that my leg still stings, and i now have one hairless streak of red skin across my leg. 
all in all i would rate the experience a 6/10

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: we have a 20 month old and live in a dense, urban area that some would consider inner-city. we live on the same block as a community health center (a health care setting i am very familiar with as i worked on federal quality programs for health centers for several years), whose clinical staff is primarily black. after completing due diligence and researching their pediatrician, and a very meaningful personal recommendation from a woman i work with who took all of her children there for decades, we selected this place for our pediatric care. super convenient since it's on our block, but we also thought it would be great for our son to grow up with black role models who were doctors and nurses who help people for a living. 

health centers in the us exist primarily for low income, under- and uninsured patients, so a dual-income white middle class family with one kid sort of sticks out there. most of the staff know my son and i by name and always greet him with cheer. 

what we did not consider is that every time my son is sick, every time he has a high fever, every time he gets a shot, it's done by a black person. it's now to the point where if he see someone on the street who looks like his pediatrician or the medical assistant who always gives him his shots, both black women, he gets very tense and starts to cry. a pretty petrifying experience in a city like ours.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: long time lurker, first time poster. had something happen today that i deemed tifu worthy, but i will allow you to be the judge of that. unlike most posts, this did indeed happen today. i am by no means a writer, so forgive my spelling and grammatical errors and join me on this tale of fuck up.

today i got out of work shortly after lunch. on my way home, i stopped at a gas station around the corner from home. i frequent this gas station roughly 4 to 5 times a week for gum, soda, etc. as usual i stop in the gas station to pick up a soda.

now i must admit, my one vice is caffiene. for some people it is alcohol, drugs, gambling, blowing dudes, for me it is caffiene. i fill up my 44 ounce polar pop (it's only 79 cents!!!!) and decide to get one to take home for my wife also. sweet, i know. i fill her up a 44 ounce polar pop of dr. pepper. i put them in once of those plastic bags they now have to carry the sodas. i grab a snack from the candy aisle and proceed to pay for my items.

i know, i know, shut up and get to the fuck up already. i set the sodas on top of my car so i can open the door. why i didn't just put my candy bar in my pocket so i could open the door with my free hand, i will never know. again, i have done this exact thing hundreds of time without consequence. until today. 

as i am attempting to open the car door, i glance up to the dr. pepper attempting to knock over the bag to escape. on top of that, this bastard was trying to take my soda with him! i was faced with a near life or death dilemma. i proceeded to save my soda while dr. pepper spills down the front of me and the side of my car.

to properly paint the picture, envision the scene in carrie, but just replace blood with dr. pepper. all 44 ounces was now on me and the car. much to my credit, i remained calm. no, this bastard dr. pepper would not get a response from me. as i sat sticky from my dr. pepper bath, i calmly picked up the empty soda cup. i put the lid back on the empty cup. i then looked around the parking lot, daring someone to make eye contact with me. my mind was made up, if someone was looking at me, i would look them in the eye and whip my dick out. to assert dominance, you know. the only person outside had their back to me, attempting to hide their laughter. i got in my car and drove home. 

i walked into the house, handed my wife her empty soda cup, and went straight to the shower.

for all of you lazy fucks, here you are.

input: Text: so today me my uncle and my dad were 
watching an arabic game show. my uncle was like take my phone and call let's see if we can get in. my uncle has a prepaid card so he was like just keep answering questions( to get points) until it ends.
  
  but for some reason the call wouldn't go through( since i live in europe and this is a saudi game show) and me being the good guy that i am i didn't want to be a buzzkill i called from my phone that runs on 35 dollar bill without the additional cost.

  my dad and uncle thought that i was calling from uncles phone so they were like
keep going and i stuck with it for some goddamn reason. the call ended being 5 minutes long and the show ended 3 fucking minutes later and it never went through of course. so i check the app now that tells you how much data and calls you've used and apparently i will be charged 30 fucking dollars for just those 5 mins in the next bill. for nothing! and 30 is a lot for me because my dad pays the bill and now it will be 60 dollars just for my phone.

  i'm thinking of trying to convince my phone company that my phone was hacked or some shit because the number is pretty long and weird but this is was a very frustrating and stupid fuck and i feel like shit right now. do you guys think it will work by the way and i know i was dumb as fuck but i just didn't want to kill the mood so please give me tips on how i could save my ass :/

input: Text: not today, but two nights ago, my friend invites me to a small party she's throwing at her house. nothing big, just a few people getting together to drink and play beer pong. i had never been to her house before and didn't know she had any pets.

so i'm the last one to get there, loud music coming from inside. i ring the doorbell, no one answers. i call my other friend who's already inside and she says, ""we're all on the back porch, just come in."" so i open the door, and i see them all behind a sliding glass window in the back playing pong. they all see me and wave with a ""come hither"" motion.

sitting in front of the sliding door is a big, beautiful husky right in my way. i love huskies, my favorite kind of dog. so, without thinking, i excitedly bend down to pet her and she jumps up and rips my face a new one then runs off.

i didn't even realize what had happened. i thought maybe she just headbutted me. i end up just standing there awkwardly dazed and embarrassed with everyone staring at me from the other side of the glass door. i think to myself, ""jesus christ i haven't even met half these people yet..."" then two of my friends come rushing in and one of them telling me, ""oh my god, you're bleeding!"" i asked, ""where?"" she says, ""everywhere!""

i dab my chin and lip with my hand and look at it. i'm a bloody mess. they all end up taking me to the bathroom and helping me clean up. i had several cuts on my bottom lip, side of my mouth and on/under my chin. my lip swelled and my chin grew to a massive size and wouldn't stop bleeding the entire night.

luckily i do pretty well in social situations so i actually did get to meet everyone and have a good night in the long run. two days later and my chin is killing me, it sometimes hurts to talk or eat.

knowing it was against the rules, and realizing i dug a hole for myself, i needed to think fast. i opened a loooong article and started reading really slowly. she managed to get back as i finished, and a few moments after 8, she logged herself in. i apologized and told her i am engrossed in reading. crisis averted...until my supervisor called me into his office a few moments later and closed the door behind me...

""did she ask you to log her in?"" he asked pretty bluntly.

""yeah, but i wasn't going to."" i replied almost too quickly, ""she caught me off guard so i read a long article to stall until she came back.""

""a guy got fired for that a while ago. that would have been stealing time, she is in more trouble than you, but next time just say 'no'."" he informed me and i was dismissed.

once i got back to my desk a different co-worker asked me what had happened. so i made up a quick lie about my car leaking oil and potentially messing up the company parking lot, and they wanted to speak to me about it.

when my supervisor heard that he asked me, ""not really a straight shooter are you?""

great he thinks i'm a liar.

input: Text: so my parents moved into a new home recently, and i have been helping with some of the moving. this morning, my dad calls me and asks me to build a chair for him. easy. i show up and open up the box to see inside is an almost entirely built chair. being an office chair, the one missing part is the wheels. at first, i am excited because this was going to be easy, but soon did i realize that these wheels are not planning on cooperating with me. just to add some clarity to the story, the axles on the wheels are not threaded, but are just straight and metal. once i get them in as far as i can push them, i try sitting on the chair and bouncing in my chair to force the wheels in. apparently doing this is a big no no because the weight was unevenly placed on the wheels causing only one to fall into place, and another to bend it's axle. in an effort to fix the axle, i resort to my primitive instincts and start hitting it with a hammer. once seeing that this will not work, i go into their garage and find their industrial grade vice grip. my logic at the time is that if it is forced in, it will straighten itself. i put the wheel-leg combo into the vice and start to crank. now i feel all smart because now the wheel is easily going in. at the very end though, it stops. this is where the bend was, and it wont go in anymore. when i lift the chair to get a better angle, i see that the vice-chair combo has totally destroyed my parents' new limestone floor. when i turn to look at the chair, i see that the vice has chewed up the wooden leg. clearly i should never be allowed around tools of any kind, and i hope that the damage is not too bad.

input: Text: the stage: my roomies are out of town for a few days and i have a big beautiful house to myself. i get a sweet tooth, but there's no sweets around, so i decide to whip up some delicious cookies. i throw together a simple recipe, heat up the oven, and pop those beauties in.

the magic act: ten minutes later, i peek at the cookies through the oven window and they're perfect. i grab a mitt, open the oven door, grab the rack and slide it out - a little too enthusiastically, apparently, because like a magician with a table cloth i have whipped the rack out of the oven so fast, the cookie sheet and the cookies don't come with it. instead, i watch in that classic, horrified slow-mo as the cookie sheet pauses for a moment in mid-air and then tilts backward, spilling my freshly baked snacks into the back of the super hot oven. to add insult to injury, the cookie sheet then falls on top of them with a clang, squashing any hopes of saving them into the oven floor.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this actually happened about two hours ago and i am still hunkered down in my apartment waiting for the doorbell to ring.

so i live in new york and currently the sidewalks are chalky and the snowy slush is iced over. it is a parking nightmare.

today i ventured out into the cold to buy a mechanical keyboard. i went to four places and came to the conclusion that i'll have to buy it online.

on my way back home, after a brisk walk of about four miles in the punishing cold, there was a van trying to get out of an icy parking spot probably ten spaces down from my apartment. it was one of those creepy unmarked white vans with graffiti that you see all the time in nyc. like this: http://imgur.com/3tkiygy. a guy was pushing it and he almost had it out but it looked like he needed help.

""need a push?"" i asked as i set my backpack down, right into a yellow slush of snow. i moved it immediately but it was too late. luckily i'm not a germaphobe.

he looked confused at my offer and i had to repeat it (in most parts of the country offering help would have been normal, but not queens, ny). he grunted a yes i think. 

so we rock the van back and forth probably five times and are very close to getting it out. a car approaches slowly. it was a man in a newer suv with his family.  he patiently tried to squeeze past the van we are trying to get out, which was sticking halfway into the road. 

this happened right as we were pushing. the man i am pushing with immediately lets go when he sees the car trying to pass, just as the van is rolling back towards us. he sidesteps the van and starts screaming at the other car (who is totally within his rights in trying to pass). 

i jumped to the side and the other guy starts walking toward the man in the suv. he screams ""what the fuck? don't you got some fucking patience? fuck you!""

after spending a year or so driving to long island, new york, the nastiest place in the u.s., i'd fucking had enough of these types of people.

""looks like he's out,"" i said as i hopped over the snow and onto the sidewalk. 

i  picked up my pissy backpack and headed towards my apartment as the guy continued to scream at the suv, not even seeing me leave. while yelling at the car he even un-tucked his shirt to reveal some horrible back tattoos, the scary prison kind.

as i was opening the gate to my apartment i heard him scream to the driver, ""the kid fucking took off! where the fuck did he go!” (i am in my thirties and i am not a kid). 

i quickly went inside. from behind my door i heard a lot more yelling between the two of them, mostly in unintelligible long island english. i locked my front door and kept my boots on just in case the psycho follows me.

so i was at my friends house last night where there were at least 20 people there just hanging out and drinking. one of my friends had his arm around this girl and she seemed into him. so i took a snapchat of both of them secretly and drew a heart around them with the caption, ""she wants the fuck. she wants the fuck"", and i accidentally ended up sending it to the girl who my friend was flirting with instead of my friends. she opened it immediately and gave me the dirtiest look. i was dying laughing but felt a little guilty at the same time.

we stayed close for a couple months then he sort of faded. he was only texting me a couple times a week. i would ask him if we were still okay and he'd reassure me that everything was alright. about a month ago was the last time he talked to me. i tried contacting him every way possible, thinking something was wrong with his phone. finally today i had a friend text him anonymously. the guy, my supposed boyfriend. answered. he broke up with me by deciding to never talk to me again. i had my friend ask him if this was his ""shitty way of breaking up with me"". no response.
whats more? my now-ex watches my snapchat story every time. has been all this past month.
that's how my three year relationship ended.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: tifu. this actually happened today; within the past 2 hours in fact. first a little back story: i am very recently divorced. it was finalized on august 24th. my ex-husband was very emotionally abusive towards me and my 8 year old son. i mention this because i was told that i could never mow the lawn because it was a ""man's job."" he would get very mad and yell at me if i ever asked to do it.

when i left him, i moved in with my disabled mother. she'll be better once she has knee surgery on both her knees but right now, she can hardly walk. naturally, it's now my job to mow the lawn. we have about a half acre of land and i didn't have a lawnmower. 

i'm trying desperately to get my life back after i gained my freedom. i'm always broke and i i can hardly make it financially. i've got some people in my life who are great blessings. on mother's day i was gifted a riding lawnmower by a local church. it's old and rackety, but it gets the job done. 

now, i'm 37 years old and i've never mowed in my life. it took awhile to get use to the beast. the dings and dents are evidence of that. today though... i really fucked up. 

running the back of the yard is a swampy stream. in the spring the rain and thaw of minnesota fills the stream so high, it engulfs half my yard. right now though, it's mud, muck and reeds. my first pass through along the stream, about a minute into my job, i noticed a giant hole but i didn't notice the giant rock. as i was simultaneously trying to avoid both the hole and the swamp, i steered wrong as i was going a little too fast. the wheels slipped on a big rock that i never noticed before, probably unearthed from the recent rain.

i started to go in and in a panic i missed the brake. then my foot slipped off the mower and went under the deck, twisting the hell out of leg. i thought for sure i was going to lose my foot but thankfully the mud stopped the blades. 

i tried to pull the mower out but it's way too heavy. i got the bright idea to turn it on, and push it out. to do this i had to reach over the seat, push down the brake with one hand and turn the key on with the other. it drove alright, all the way into the middle of the swamp!!

by this time i was crying; i'm unfortunately a very emotional person, especially when aunty flo is soon planning a visit. i ran into the house flailing my arms, screaming to my mom that i was so stupid and i put the mower in the swamp.

i went back out, my mom was soon to follow. i climbed into the swamp, unfortunately losing my shoes somewhere in the murky abyss. i turned the mower on and signaled to my mom to put it in gear. i was able to push it out onto dry land after a couple of tries.

i escaped with both feet, minus my shoes, and with some minor cuts from the reeds. my leg is really sore, too. thankfully, the mower still works great and i was able to mow today so i don't have to do it on labor day!

anyway, this happened a couple years ago and i can't remember exactly because i'm always trying to forget this incident. i got up in the morning as usual and started the process of getting ready for school (7th-9th grade maybe?). i waited for my sister to get out of the shower as she was the one who got up the earliest out of everyone. when she got out(of the bathroom), i went in and proceeded to take my shower. this is where the magic happens.

about three minutes or so in i have a fart building up inside of me. it felt like a normal fart so i let it out. little did i know that this bad boy would ruin my day. i heard a splat on the wall behind me. i turned around the my fart had actually turned out to be an explosion(explosive shart?). i had created my very own ~~picasso~~poocasso all over my shower wall. i grabbed the shower head and started spraying down my painting. i could have made millions off of that... my poop starts sliding off. at the same time, i'm also trying to avoid making foot contact with them. i miscalculate my step and slip. 

then i wake up on my bed and my parents are staring at me, bewildered. apparently, i had slipped in the shower, my head hit the wall with enough force to knock me out(my mother knows all). they had found me lying face down in the shower. when they picked me up, the front of my body was covered in poop and they had to clean me up and get me tf out of there. they asked me what happened and i had to lie and tell me i couldn't remember that far back. only my sister knows the tale of my misfortune and now reddit.

 

**edit:** grammar

**edit:** wow, when i was typing this i never expected 1k upvotes. i was thinking that i'd be lucky to get at least 30. i'm not sure if i should be thanking you guys for this but thanks!!!

**edit:** people think that my sister was in the bathroom with me as i took the shower, that is not true and my fault for wording it funky.

input: Text: so this happened last friday, but it still terrifies me a little bit when i think about it.
i am a student studying abroad (currently in canada), and i went to the university library to study for a few hours. now a key thing in this story is my umbrella, it was a rainy day and i decided to take my umbrella with me. now the thing about this umbrella is it has this plastic katana handle, it was comfortable when i held it so i bought it without really thinking much about it.

so fast forward a few hours later i wait for my bus at the university, and i had my umbrella closed cause it wasn't really raining that much. i get into the bus, put my headphones on and just zone out. 
now something i never thought of happen, i hear someone calling out sir multiple times. i look on my left and i find two female officers with one of them having her gun out pointed at me, at this point am terrified to an unbelievable point. i start thinking of recent police shootings and movie, and if movies taught me anything, i just threw my hand in the air. i have no clue what is going on, or why is any of this happening. then i look down and realize, the damn umbrella.

i look at them and keep repeating ""its just an umbrella, its just an umbrella"", they don't seem to care, and ask me to exit the bus and put my hand on the fence outside of the bus. 
at this point am dying in the inside, they take everything away from me and put it on the ground while it is raining, i keep repeating it is just an umbrella while she asks me if i have any id on me and what is my name, at this point am almost sure am being held cause am middle eastern and someone thought i will go blow something up, cause they don't seem to care when i tell them about the umbrella. i ask the officer if i may know what is wrong. she tells me someone from the university saw me walking back and forth with a sword, planning something crazy. she then proceeds to ask me if am feeling mentally well today or not, and i almost burst out laughing (that is basically my defense mechanism if am nerves or scared), i tell her am ok and again i repeat that it is just an umbrella. 

then a third officer arrives and he checks the umbrella and then screams ""i knew it! it was a sword umbrella, i told you guys!"" he starts laughing while admiring the umbrella while am just staring into the fence. the officers tell me am ok while they are having a laugh and just to be careful while holding the umbrella around, also to consider getting a new one. they walk me back into the bus  while my brain is confused, i get in and a few people are clapping and others are just shocked, they ask me what happened and if am ok. i tell them all is well, and it is because of my umbrella. some laugh and some look shocked and outraged, they try and keep me calm but at this point, i am just about to cry and laugh at the same time. 

i walk home with the umbrella completely open so this does not happen again, i don’t tell my family about what happened and i just stare into the roof thinking that i want to burn the umbrella to the ground.
i will add a picture of the umbrella at the bottom, sorry for the bad quality of the post and pictures.

 

also, here is some pictures of the umbrella, i do understand how they behaved when they saw it.

input: Text: this was last night. please excuse my spelling, i'm on my phone and my hands are useless right now (ever try typing with your off hand only? it's tedious) 

my wife, son and i went to a good friends house for dinner and a fire to celebrate him buying said house. the night was over, i went to my car to warm it up and when i came back in learned the hard way that the front door requires some force to close. we realize this about 10 mins later when we see it open a few inches.  a quick search of the house leads us to the conclusion that the cat has escaped. it's his girlfriends cat, who was sleeping on the couch, and she'd lose her shit if said cat got lost.

we go into damage control mode and start trying to find a black fluff ball at like 11,in the woods,before the girlfriend woke up. 

20-30 mins of hunting later, jackpot! it's a cat! cue fuck up.  it's dark, my friend is nowhere near me and the cat was no familiar with me. i go up to him, calling his name calmly. he kind of growls but comes up to me. i remember the cat is declawed, so i decided fuck it and lunged to grab him.  as it turns out declawed cats still have teeth, and this mother fucker is having none of my attempts. i yell to my friend though the woods and try to grab the demon again.  apparently adrenaline is a hell of a drug. by the time my friend came over i start to feel blood dripping. shined my shitty phone light on my arm and realized immediately i was in trouble.  my arm has a golf ball size bubble that's bleeding, my fingers are chewed up. scratches everywhere too (turns out they usually only declaw the front paws).

my friend takes over the chase, and my wife collects my son and off to the er we go.  long er story short, i'm on oral antibiotics with a follow up tomorrow.  because the bites were in joints, iv antibiotics and/or orthopedic surgery/problems are still a very real possibility. my right hand and arm are swollen, and my left thumb took a direct bite and hurts like hell to move.  damn the opiate crisis, the doc gave me nothing, and ibuprofen doesn't touch this shit. 

some pictures for you morbidly curious types :

edit: for the concerned, my friend texted me a couple hours later to tell me it wasn't all in vain and the cat had  been successfully recovered!

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened a few weeks ago. i was going to post about it then, reconsidered doing so, but have since decided that i need to get it off my chest. 

i am an assistant on a research project at my university. the lab consists of two rooms separated by a two-way mirror. the mirror isn't exactly part of the study, it just happened to be in the rooms that we were given to use as a lab. basically, my job is to greet subjects, give them instructions, and then sit there and wait while they complete each step on a computer. there's a computer in the control room too, and consequently i spend a lot of time in the lab just surfing the internet. i probably should be doing homework, but you know how that goes. 

on this particular day, i was between subjects, and clicking mindlessly through r/creepypms. you know, typical conversations about ""making the sex"" and whatnot. subject shows up and i jump up and escort them into the other room to start the session. as i am giving instructions i notice a shadow moving in the mirror. since i left the door open in the other room, the light from the hallway makes it so that you can still see into it, though very faintly. the pi's office isn't too far from the lab, and she was in that day, so i figured she just popped in to either check on me or tell me something, realized i was with a subject and left. 

after i got the subject started, i returned to the control room and to my horror find a big, crudely censored dick adorning the monitor on the computer. i apparently had stumbled across one of the conversations featuring an unsolicited dick-pick, ever so common on the sub, and either neglected to close the window or didn't even look at it in the first place before the subject arrived. i can't be sure. all i know is that it's highly likely my professor walked in and saw it. granted, it was obviously a screen-grab from a kik conversation, but the image was definitely the focal point of the screen. i have seen her several times since, and she hasn't mentioned it, but i am still pretty embarrassed.

input: Text: [excuse the shitty writing]

so today i thought i would get to fixing that old laptop that's been laying around for a few years. the one my sister used for 4 years.

i did some testing and figured i'd should just reinstall windows to see how that might help out. so i yanked the hard-drive out of th laptop and hooked it up to my machine so i could back-up any needed files/documents. after a while of searching around and cut-pasting a few files, i decide to see what lies in the my video's folder. 

this is the part where i fuck up.

i open the folder, half-expecting to see a heap of unwatched jersey shore episodes and half-expecting to see nothing. 
instead i see a file. just a harmless avi. file named after the date of which it was saved. i give a good ole' double click on that file thinking it would probably be just a sample video or some shit.

nup. not even fucking close.

what appeared on my screen was so fucked up that it took me a little while to realize what in the name of fuck i was witnessing.

a room. not just any room, my sisters bedroom.
what was in the room you ask? just an ordinary bed.
and when i say ordinary, i mean it had my sisters boyfriend laying butt-naked on top of it jacking off at the speed of fucking sonic holy fuck.

he came. he came hard.

as soon as i realized what i was watching, i fucking slammed alt-f4 harder then my sisters boyfriend was slamming his dick. i immediately deleted the video and began formatting the hard-drive.

only some sort of high-powered laser beam could help me unsee that video.

and that reddit is how i fucked up and why i'm never going to be able to look my sisters boyfriend in the eye again.

input: Text: this won't seem as bad as a lot of the posts on here but to me it was one of the worst things i've ever done. i have to get it off my chest.

i'm just starting dental school and i really like one of the girls in my class (let's call her ""s""). we've been hanging out a lot and we've gotten really close and even though we haven't known each other for that long i really feel amazing about this girl and i think she may be the one for me. both of us are the quiet shy types and not really into big parties. this weekend we had our final orientation week event: an overnight trip to the beach in a nearby beach town. we stayed in some cottages and had a little yard to ourselves and all of us being students, of course there was a massive party in the evening. the second year students who were running it surprised us with two kegs and we had a huge flip cup tournament. normally i wouldn't drink as much but there was so much free beer and i was just a giant idiot that night and kept drinking. i started trying to hang out with all the ""cool"" party animals instead of with s and the other quieter people i've gotten close to. i ended up vomiting and probably lost a lot of respect from my new friends.

this morning when i woke up i felt like shit and could barely drink water. i was feeling ok for a while but started feeling nauseous. around this point i took s to go grocery shopping and was feeling pretty terrible but i thought i'd be able to hold back from throwing up. on the way back to my car i told her i was too sick to drive and asked her to drive and i brought a grocery bag with me. in the middle of the ride i ended up throwing up in the bag right in front of her. i've never been more embarrassed in my life. she said she was really disappointed in me and that she won't forget this. i feel like the worst person in the world; even in the short while we've known each other i'm developing feelings for her and her disappointment is killing me right now. it's not even just her i'm disappointed in myself because i know i'm not that type of person. there was no reason to get that drunk just to please all the party animals who i'm not even friends with. i ended up talking it out with her this evening and while she says she forgives me she said she won't forget it. i deserve all the shame and embarrassment but at the same time i really want her to still like me after this.

i know most of you have experienced being super drunk and won't think it's a big deal but i really fucked up. s is really disappointed in the fact that i wasn't able to have self control that night and tried too hard to be something i'm not. i lost a lot of respect last night from her and from the other people i want to be friends with and i don't know how i'm gonna fix it. to whoever reads this: remember my story next time you plan on getting shitfaced and i hope you learn from my mistakes.

input: Text: *this is gonna be kind of long so bear with me*

so i'm a young guy, pretty tech savvy, likes to think he can do everything himself and who cares about reading fine print, right? that being said, i also live in the southern us, and nobody ever taught me how to do my taxes so i've been learning as i go.

this is the first year i've had to pay taxes in a lump sum instead of receive a refund thanks to a now-former part time employer who messed with my tax info and gave me more than one deduction. i ended up owing $500+ for state and fed combined. 

(i work two jobs, one main one and i get a part time job every now and again when i get bored)

well i've used turbotax every year that i've filed and everything has always been good. but i failed to remember that i always get refunds... this is the first year i've had to pay. and being the young adult that i am, i'm pretty used to payments being processed immediately. i get two emails saying both my state and fed returns have been accepted by the irs, and i forget about it.

the thing is, i get paid the exact same amount every month (yay government work) and i know exactly when my bills post and how much comes out of my account. i look at my account a week after i file and i have a large amount in there, but not an unusually large amount.

fast forward to a week later when i see a sweet 1978 yamaha xs400 on craigslist for a steal. i buy it, i'm stoked. i still have a large sum that will carry me through the month to pay day.

cut to the day after tax day. i go to 7-11 to get myself an icee and the lady tells me that my card had insufficient funds. shocked as i was, i paid with a credit card and hopped in my truck. checked my balance, i was sitting at a coooool -$3.46. looked at my charges, and my account wasn't charged until the deadline day. 

now i'm back to living on pb&j's and since i use my truck for work daily, had to bum gas money from my girlfriend. super cool look.

later as we are driving home i tell my wife about how i could not believe that guy from earlier. not understanding who i was talking about i go into full detail describing what he looked like. she looks at me and says ""that guy wasn't trying to hump me! he had severe parkinson's disease! did you not see his entire body trembling? you asshole.""

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this fuck-up is not recent(2012), but it is my biggest fuck-up to date.

i was at a friends house and he had recently bought a bottle of absinthe, as some of you might know, absinthe is one of the strongest liquors out there with a alcohol percentage ranging between 40-80%.(our bottle was in the 70's range)

so, the night started with us playing some games on his cracked xbox and eating some peanuts. we fired up a heavily reaction based platformer and i came up with an idea, wouldn't it be fun to see how we fared drunk?

well here's where the drinking started.
first we whipped out the vodka, poured two shots each and downed them.

nothing really changed with our reaction times.

ok.. let's spice it up, i took two tumblers and started pouring some vodka in it. i then saw a bottle of rum sitting on a shelve and poured some of that in as well, my friend then reminded me that he has a bottle of absinthe. i poured some in and served one of the glasses to my friend.

we finished those and were now pretty damn drunk, but we could still finish the levels in the game, huh.. ""i guess we need more liquor"" i said to my friend.

he then came up with the exceptional idea of pouring ten shots each, alternating between vodka and absinthe. i then added to the idea by suggesting we do some jumping jacks between shots to get the blood pumping and the alcohol flowing.

we take the first shot, no biggie.

we take the third shot, i'm feeling a little wobbly..

we take the eighth shot, i'm having serious balance issues at this point.

""here goes the last shot!"" i say enthusiastically, i down it and start playing the game. i can't complete any level at this point. mission complete i guess?

i lay back on my friend's bed defeated, and as i lay there the room starts spinning, at first slowly and it gradually speeds up to an unbearable point. i tell my friend what is happening and he hands me a glass of water. now, what your supposed to do with that water is sip it, slowly to get your nausea down. i did not do such a thing, i downed that glass like i had been in the sahara desert all my life and then i flopped back down on the bed on my back.

what happened next is something you'll need to picture from my friend's pov, when i hit the bed i felt my whole body drop in temperature and i started sweating. shortly after a beautiful fountain of peanuts, rum, vodka, absinthe and water flew out of my mouth and hit the ceiling, and then came crashing down on my face and the bed.

we still talk about the fountain installation in the basement of my friend's house to this day.

first, let me start with some backstory.  i am 16 years old, and i am fairly tall for my age (6 foot 3 inches for those of you wondering).  often times, people ask me if i play ""ball"" (this is important later) but i laugh and say ""no, but i can see why you would think that."" and now for the fuck-up.

i was at a hardware store with my dad, and we were waiting in line at the register.  when we get to the cashier, the employee asks me if i play ""ball"" and i look at him and i say: ""no, i don't play basketball.""  i have no idea what made me say the word ""basketball"" as opposed to my regular response.  the cashier suddenly shut his mouth, and finishing ringing up the items we bought, and said nothing as we grabbed our bags and left.  it was not before a good 5 minutes into the car ride home that i realized what i had just done.

the cashier was black.

i have never felt so much like an asshole as i did then.

today i walked down to my bus stop, the usual routine, and leant on the door. this time, someone forgot to lock the door. i fell into the room about as gracefully as a sloth, looking around, slightly bewildered, until i heard a beeping noise from the alarm going off. i ran away from the restaurant as fast as possible, not even bothering to shut the door, which was wide open, and went onto the next stop, where i ended up catching the bus.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: obligatory ""this didn't happen today,"" it actually happened a couple of months ago. let me introduce myself, i'm currently a college freshman from queens living at a college in the bronx. i went to an all-boys high school in manhattan, and during my senior year there, i was in a school musical, where i met a girl. she was the most beautiful girl i've ever met, incredible body, long blond hair, blue eyes, the works, and she was really, really into me. we started dating after seeing each other for a while, and wound up staying together for about 8 months.


as i started to get accustomed to college and succeed, socially, in work, and in school, she grew jealous and crazy, trying to make me stop spending time with all female friends and threatening me whenever i wanted to stay at school instead of spending time with her, even if it was because i had work to do. so, after a while i decide enough is enough and decide to break it off. here's where the fuck up comes.

so, the day i decide to break it off, she texts me before i leave to get on the train to grand central, where i'm supposed to meet her. text says that she has a surprise for me. great. i get off my train, and meet her by the big clock in the center of grand central. she has a large foil tin in her hand, and hands it over confidently. i slide the cover off and look in, and see a fresh batch of my favorite cookies. guilt sets in. she tells me to take the cover all the way off, and look in. so i do, and this reveals big felt letters glued to the inside of the tin top : ""formal?"", underneath a big picture of us. she was asking me to her big junior formal dance that would happen about a month later. more guilt. i tell her nervously that i'd be happy to go with her. so, i hug her, and head to our destination, which was to visit our old acting friends at a rehearsal at my old school. i begin acting very distant and aloof, and as we're walking down 14th street, she asks me what's wrong, and playfully asks if i even want to be with her anymore. to which i cannot mutter a response better than ""erm...uhh.."" reeking of awkward discomfort. she picks up on this and pulls me over to the side of the sidewalk to talk.

 she asks me again, seriously this time. i begin to blurt the truth about how crazy she's been, and plainly and confidently state to her, ""i'm sorry, but i'm unhappy, and i do not wish to date you anymore."" she gives me a blank look, and then begins to react. for those of you who don't know nyc, 14th street is the widest street in  manhattan, and thus receives the most pedestrian foot traffic. so, there were many eyes on us as she begins to rip into me, shouting all manner of obscenities, and accusing me of cheating on her and even being gay. at this point, i'm balancing the cookie-tin in one hand as a waiter holds a tray. bad idea, i know. during her verbal assault, she throws a vicious uppercut at the poor, unsuspecting tin of trader joe's cookies, sending it flying through the air above us, delicious morsels scattering like chocolatey shrapnel. after what felt like 30 seconds for the tin to actually re-conform to the forces of gravity, the tin lands displaying about half the cookies (the ones that didn't fly out), and the tin lid lands propped up against it in such a way that the picture of us and the big letters spelling ""formal"" faced our curious 14th street audience perfectly. passers-by couldn't help to put two and two together when they saw and heard her screaming, standing over the cookie tin display at our feet. i heard all manner of sympathies from the small crowd that had gathered, such as ""poor girl!"", ""she's getting her heart broken!"", ""oh, i feel so bad for her!"", and even a ""what an asshole."" when i asked my now ex if we could turn the corner and talk somewhere else, she said no, and continued to rip into me in front of what felt like all of lower manhattan.

now, if you'll allow me to rant: i walked away with some semblance of dignity today, though not before being used up and discarded. in the last week & a half, i've been transferred to a non-english speaking work site (guaranteeing 0 possibility of commission) and reassigned to assemble and deliver 100+ lbs. merchandise to locations over 65 miles from home base, all the while floating a payroll deficit of several hundred dollars. 

yes, i began working exactly 1 month ago from today, and i have, as of right now, been paid for 6 of my ~22 days of service, partially due to misentered time as well as a poorly staggered pay schedule.

not only was no attempt made to rectify the faux pas immediately by offering to cut a check, but there was no discussion about when the remainder would be paid.

i could mull over the litany of problems this place has, but now that i'm done venting i'm going to look forward to my next job.

this trick is one of my most favorite ice breakers, because one its funny as hell on unsuspecting strangers, and two usually starts a friendly rivalry to break the ice even more. welp since we are few weeks into school i got grouped up with a guy i barely knew 5 years ago and came back this year. also the football team came back this week from a flight. one caught a cold and now it spreads through the community like wild fire. i think you guys are starting to know where this is going. welp there i am in class with a shit ass grin knowing full on what the hell im going to do to this unsuspecting guy. i just casually ask for help with the assignment, then say ""aww sweet design dude"" as i finger touch his chest and as he looks down i then full on proceed to flick my finger up to my impending doom. second later my finger is full on shoved for three seconds in the most snotiest thing i have ever felt. followed by my shock of terror as i had unconvienietly felt the nastiest shit possible in a classroom. i immediatly ran to cleanse the horridly goop now embeded into my fingernail and tip into a enough hand sanitizer to wash my whole body with. after about a good minute of me freaking the hell out(im a clean freak) and this guy laughing his ass off as the trick backfired on me, we ended up getting pretty cool the rest of the day. so this mess ups not that bad in my book, but it was totally a til not to do this trick to sick people.

well, here's where things get awkward. turns out, the guy thought i was flirting with him and while i wasn't paying attention to him, he called me cute. my boss heard it and tried to get me to stop joking around with the guy about the jonah hill thing. it wasn't until after i almost finished my dinner did i realize he was checking me out the entire time and tried flirting back with me. i felt extremely awkward and ended dinner early.

input: Text: i suddenly remembered this story and thought that this would make a great tifu story. this is generally what happened. 

context: when i was younger, i dreamed of one day working for a major airline (eventually ended up as an actuary). but, i was discouraged from getting  into an airline company, as i felt my  economics degree from a state school put me at a great disadvantage. i felt that the the kids majoring in aviation management major from a flight school in daytona beach would always have the upper leg. 

when i was an undergraduate at my state school in 2009, i decided to go to the career fair. while there, i see the booth for a major airline. i go up and start a normal conversation with the recruiter. i tell him the usual, i like planes, i know this about your airline and such. 
after a while, the recruiter said:
""wow, i am surprised at how much you know about us. you should apply""

as he said this, without thinking, i said 
""you know, i would love to. but, i know that all of the kids from that stupid daytona beach school are going to take it from me.""

then he says 
""um. okay. well, your assumptions are wrong. we consider everybody. thanks for stopping by.""

as i left, he said
""by the way. i was a (schools mascot)""

i never applied and ended up giving up my aspirations of working for an airline company. i instead ended up finding work in the  insurance industry.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened over ten years ago. i actually recovered my old livejournal password so i could find the post i made the day this happened! here is the version edited for reddit:

i used to be an aquarist at a large public aquarium – basically the same thing as a zookeeper, except for fish and other aquatic animals. although the job requires a minimum of a bachelor's degree in a relevant field, plus substantial aquarium experience, you're really nothing more than a janitor for fish.

one of the exhibits i was in charge of was ""tigers,"" that is, the large fish pond in the tiger exhibit. (the only difference between zoos and aquariums is emphasis: zoos usually have some fish, and aquariums usually have some land animals.) most mornings i would go back there before the tigers were put on exhibit to take the water temperature for the logbook.

one thing important to know about our tigers is they were *not tame*. there was never direct contact between tigers and humans. they were trained and fed through cage bars, and we had numerous safety protocols to make sure there would never be an opportunity for a tiger to interact with a human without a barrier.

the tiger exhibit was set up thusly: the access to the reserve (behind-the-scenes) area, where the tiger cages and storage area are, was from the public pathway. about half of the large reserve room was for humans exclusively, and at the far end of this is the human door to the exhibit. the rest of the room contained the tiger cages, which were connected to each other by gates, and the tigers entered and exited the exhibit via a gated tunnel. at night, the tigers slept in reserve; they were never left on exhibit overnight.

that morning i saw a tiger trainer (let's call her p) and a volunteer diver (call him d). (we had a number of volunteer divers who would clean the exhibits in exchange for the chance to dive regularly with our animals.) so i asked the assistant mammals curator (let's call him c) to let me in so i could take the temperature. (one of the safety protocols is that *nobody* has access to the tiger area except tiger trainers, so i couldn't even go into my own exhibit without a trainer to open the door.) i went out into the exhibit with p and d and did my thing; then the three of us returned to reserve. i only saw two tigers (there are four) in the cages, so i asked p where the other two were. she said they were in the tunnel, and pointed to ... only one. we couldn't find the fourth tiger (let's call him j). i started to feel nervous at this point while p checked the cages from every conceivable angle. i sort of drifted to the door to the exhibit with the thought of closing it until we found j. meanwhile, d went back out on exhibit to get ready to dive, so i didn't close the door tightly (it locked automatically).

p kept looking for j even after it was obvious he was missing. she called c on the radio, then went to the exhibit door and looked out. i don't remember why on earth i followed her out there, but next thing i remember, p and i were staring up at j... above our heads, regarding us coolly. protocol in a tiger-human contact situation was to immediately call for on the radio with an emergency code. but p told me, ""just wait, just wait,"" and calmly called d to come back to reserve. this happened so fast i never got to call the code. we closed the door just as c was coming into reserve. in fact, i had to stop c from opening the second door (it's double-gated, like an airlock, for safety) until the exhibit door was locked.

d and i left the reserve, leaving c and p to sort out the tiger situation. that was when my brain and body finally reacted to the situation, and i got the shakes and hyperventilated a bit. d, p and i all could have been killed while we were dinking around on exhibit. i was really jumpy while i finished my pre-opening tasks, and then i had to leave early because i was too nervous to function very well.

they say that the moment you get complacent about dangerous situations, something disastrous will happen. that day in tiger reserve, we were all complacent. none of us counted tigers before going on exhibit. 

luckily j was a young tiger, not quite two years old, and still a little shy. in the wild, he would have been just be starting to hunt on his own; his predatory instincts don't seem to be 100% there yet. he might have been stalking us (nobody saw him, so we don't know), or he might have just been sleepy, waking up, and not thinking predatory thoughts. thanks be to god he didn't decide to attack (or ""play with"") with the humans in his territory!

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this was about a year ago.  i had a problem with my dogs eating my cats' poop.  one day i was in a thrift store and i saw a pair of octagon end tables with cubbies.  instantly, i realized i could put the litter box in one of the tables and the cats' food bowls in the other.  this would solve the problem of the dogs messing with the cats' stuff.

when i brought the tables home it turned out that the triangle cat box was just a smudge too big to fit inside.  one corner stuck out and kept the door from closing. it still worked.  i turned the table so that the door faced the wall.  the cats could get in but the dogs couldn't.  

this should have been fine but the next day my husband had taken the litter box out of the table because it didn't fit all the way in.  actually, i never thought of this before but i think his main issue was that he wanted the doors to face outward because he turned both of the tables around so that the doors didn't face the walls anymore.  

i should've turned those tables back around and kept using them like i wanted.  instead, i just gave up on the idea.  at the time, i figured i would just go pick up a box that fit.  never did.  ended up giving the tables away.  then for some reason, we got rid of the big litter box but didn't have a new one.  i grabbed a random plastic bin from around the house and filled it with litter.  as soon as the cats used it i was asking myself why i didn't just switch to using this small bin instead of keeping the big one. 

my dogs still eat cat litter.  one almost threw up on the rug a few hours ago.

input: Text: throw away for obvious reasons.  also nsfw

my boyfriend has some specific preferences when it comes to blow jobs. i'm sure everyone does. he doesn't care if i spit or swallow, but his main requests are that he does not ever see/touch his semen and for me to continue throughout his orgasm and not pull away immediately after he has ejaculated. 

today as i was giving my boyfriend head, he politely gave me the same tap on the shoulder that he always does to warn me that he's coming, and i brace myself to swallow/at least contain everything in my mouth so that there's nothing to clean up. 

however, as my mouth filled with his semen and he continued thrusting, i found myself unable to swallow anything due to how deep he still was in my throat, and didn't want it to spill, so i just kept trying to contain it. i felt a strange sensation, and tapped him back as a warning that something was wrong and i was going to have to pull away, and made sure he didn't see it as his seemed continued to burst out of my nose. i cleaned up what went onto the carpet, and went to the bathroom to flush my nose with some cold water in hopes of easing the burning sensation. it didn't quite help. i went back to the scene of the fuck up to find him in his post ejaculatory bliss and explained my fuck up.

ex-gf is out of the picture. moved away while we were still dating. her and i tried the long distance thing, ended up growing apart. i broke it off.

current gf and i go waaaaay back. friends in early high school. fell hard for her shortly after i broke it off with ex-gf, and have been together ever since. (~8 mo.)



here's the tifu: last weekend:

went to a mutual friends house with gf to drink and hang out. played some games, drank, played some hackysack, did shots, lit shit on fire, drank some more. you know, one of *those* nights.
me and gf had been planning to/dropping hints about sex all night to each other. so we were both extraordinarily horny when we got back to her place. i, however am at this point, borderline blackout drunk. (the shots i took right before we left had time to settle into my bloodstream on the ride home) 

i remember bits and pieces of some of the greatest sex of my life.
69, cowgirl, doggy, anal, you name it, we did it that night.

the part i don't remember is telling my gf ""i love you ex-gf"" while we were doing the deed.

i wake up to my shit packed on the counter, and her in the living room telling me to sober up and gtfo. i try to explain. i fail because i don't know wtf is going on, and am still super hammered.

we work things out, and decide to try and disregard it. but now i can tell the she's more reserved around me. since, you know, i called her my ex-gf whilst drunk.

anyways so we're down on the beach just lighting off small things before it got dark. we're at the ocean so its a little windy too. so i get a bottle rocket in my hand, stand 4 feet in front of this container, and light the bottle rocket. it goes, blows up, and all is fine and dandy. then i look back and a mortar fuse is lit.. holy crap. one of the sparks from the bottle rocket must have gone backwards and been carried by the wind right onto a mortar fuse.. so i yell ""holy crap run!"" and my friend and i sprint in multiple directions and watch as $1000 in fireworks explodes at once. it looked like a finale of a fireworks show. stuff was exploding all over the place, while my heart was going a million miles an hour, and my pants were probably pretty soaked. 

so then the explosions stopped. my friend looks over at me, with a look of pure surprise. the plastic container was completely destroyed. there were little pieces of fireworks all over the place, smoldering. this guy from far away is yelling at us, calling us idiots and dumb a**es. just as my heart was slowing down, i see smoke off in the distance. part of the fireworks started a brush fire on the beach.. heart rate went straight back up. we ran back and forth from the water trying to use it to put out the fire, while also using sand to cover it too. that stupid guy off in the distance? yeah he called the fire department. by the time they showed up, the fire was out. they just wanted to walk through it to check for hot spots. yeah what a great senior trip

now my so and i are into ass play on both giving and receiving ends. tonight i was doing some man-scaping getting ready for her to come over. so naturally i try and have a bm before she comes over so im all clear, and i decide it would be a good idea to stick a finger in myself so i can check to see if the roads are clear. i immediately realized my mistake. i didn’t know my asshole could have tastebuds, but lo and behold i can feel the fire of every seed searing the inside of my rectum. i would consider doing an enema of milk, but i’m lactose intolerant and eating milk is hard enough to shit out as it is, let alone pouring it up my ass before it would explode back out.. my so should be here in about 20 minutes, so i’m sure this will make for a fun conversation.

input: Text: so a little background... i used to work the overnights at a 24 hour pharmacy and it was usually pitch black out when i would leave for work. i also live about 20 miles out in the country on an unlit back road. 

so i'm getting in my car to leave for work one evening and i was in a bit of a hurry. i drove a 2007 chevy aveo which is a tiny subcompact car. i get on the road and get about a quarter mile from my driveway when i see a paper bag in the middle of the road. now i had just come over the crest of a hill,  so i didn't really get a lot of time to react. my thoughts as follow all occurred in about 3 seconds. 

""hmmm... a paper bag... can't swerve left as there is an oncoming car, can't swerve right as i'll go into the ditch, don't want to hit the bag with my tires... might be full of nails or something... i know, ill just let it go right between my tires!""

so i hit the bag going around 50 mph and my car lurches into the air and swerves me toward the oncoming car, fortunately i was able to correct and not get into a head on collision, but when i looked down at my dash all my warning lights are on. shit. so i make a uturn and drive back to my house. i figure i probably ripped out the oil pan but i need to get to work so i take my other car and drive off. 

i work my shift and start heading home. it's daylight by now, so i get a good look at the carnage. the ""bag"" i had hit was in fact a large sandstone rock that my car had obliterated. rock bits all over the road. there is also a long trail of the fluids from my car from where i hit the rock all the way back to my driveway. 

$7500, a new oil pan, transmission, and radiator, later... my car is back in business. stupid bag...

now i'm the youngest out of 6 siblings and a former marine. i'm used to rough housing so i start laughing,  put my shoulder down, and charge forward a few steps intending to just give him a light hearted bump. 

in the process it slips my mind that he's 63 years old and half my size. as soon as contact is made, he gets knocked back into a table and i trip on an extension cord. we both fall to the floor making a loud racket while doing so.

next thing i know we're both in my boss's office with my co-worker talking about workman's comp and my boss screaming about how close i am to getting fired. ultimately the co-worker says he's fine and i get  shit detail for the foreseeable future.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: a long time ago i found my dad's condom stash. so i decided to experiment masturbating with condoms. usually i would just put some porn on my psp and spank my monkey in the bathroom. so i got a condom and my psp and locked myself in the bathroom.

i tore open the little plastic thing the condom comes in. as i was about to put it on i stopped. i told myself ""you know, maybe i can add some 'lube' to....enhance.....the experience""

i looked through the entire bathroom for something that might be a good substitute for lube. then i came across a bottle of shampoo. i grinned. i unrolled the condom, and poured a crapload of shampoo into the condom. then i slowly slid my rock hard prepubescent penis into it.

""oh yeah, that's the stuff""

it felt so good. i loaded up a video on my psp and started polishing my bishop.

i finished up and flushed all the evidence down the toilet. everything was great and i was proud of myself for discovering a new masturbation technique.

the next day i was at school and i was so horny my dick was harder than the last level of trials hd.

i got home and ran into my room and jumped on my bed. i pulled my pants down and scurried to get my psp. i opened a porn video and started choking my purple headed warrior.

it felt...weird. so i looked down and i almost had a heart attack.

my penis was shriveled and wrinkly. the skin was peeling off(kinda like when you have a sunburn).



that was exactly what my penis head looked like. i started crying. i thought i had some crazy std or something(even though i was a virgin).

i ran into the bathroom and locked the door. i was so scared. i had never been so scared in my life. my penis looked like someone put it in an oven for an hour. i got down on my knees and prayed to ""god""(even though i was not/am not religious, i was so scared i was willing to pray for it to go away).

i put my penis under some running water to see what would happen and it actually went back to normal. but like 2 minutes after that it shriveled up again[face_plain]. so, for the next two days i was just splashing my dick with water to try and get it to stay ""normal"".

on the third day it was fine and i was relieved. i still wanted to find out what the **** went wrong. after some searching on yahoo answers i found out it was the shampoo. apparently it has happened to tons of men.

moral of the story: when you're gonna stroke your bamboo, don't use shampoo.

input: Text: 6 years ago. i was working in my parent's companies office. i'm minding my own business,
trying to bring structure into the chaotic piles my dad calls 'his paperwork'. i'm copying
customer data into our new computer system so i can get rid of all the aweful post-it notes.

the daughter of a regular comes into my office. she is attractive and something around 20.
she is the daughter of a regular customer we've known for years.
let's call her cutie21. we have some smalltalk while i'm writing her bill. i'm done, she will
hand it to her dad who is going to pay via bank transfer. everything done, she is good to go.

5 minutes later, i'm kinda stressed cause i have to deal with 3 phone calls at once, all
from customers who couldn't find their own asses with two hands.
now one of our other regulars comes in. dude is 50+ and got one of these twirly moustaches.
it's neatly trimmed and all but... i don't know, it looks aweful. i guess no one has
the heart to tell him.

he goes: ""hey frai23, the you remember the cute girl from a couple of minutes ago?
well, we talked and made a date to grab some coffee but she completely forgot to
give me her phone number. you mind looking it up for me?"".

i'm thinking: ""you idiot, she is just friendly to anyone, like in beeing nice. she was not
flirting with you, i was there. the 'grab a coffee' -thing was clearly a joke you tool.""

well... i'm really stressed at that point and just don't want to deal with oldfartwithmoustache
right now and tell him:
""you are out of luck buddy, we don't have her number in our system.""

he babbles for like two minutes straight, and ends with: ""how 'bout her adress then?""

now at this point i really want him out so i can continue work. and i'm kinda proud
that i allready put in almost half of our client base, that's hundreds of stupid post-its!

i write it down for him. he says thanks and leaves, telling me he is gonna visit her.

i see him getting into his car. he drives of. glad he is gone.
suddenly i get this chill feeling from head to toe.
i just stare out the window for like 10 seconds, my mouth is open.

may be 30 seconds later i'm sitting in my own car. i'm at the highway, doing around 180 on the
left lane. my thoughts are something like: 
""this fucking idiot. i am a fucking idiot. dad will kill me. her dad will kill me. but not if
i'm at their place before fuckingoldfartwithmoustache.""

i succeed to call my dad who knows oldfartwithmoustache for years, i tell him the story and he
manages to call oldfartwithmoustache, threatening him with telling his wife (!).
oldfartwithmoustache comes back to our businessplace and promises to not stalk this girl.
he goes home deeply ashamed, with a red head glancing at his shoes.

6 years passed, the girl is alive and well and i still feel like the biggest
retard on the planet whenever i think about that story...

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened about an hour ago and now i am absolutely livid with myself and crushed from the overwhelming boredom of not having my laptop. 

so i'm in the army. my buddies and i have been playing a ton of pubg recently. unfortunately i have had a persisting issue in that game from buildings not rendering for minutes after landing, and just long load times in general. 

today i took it upon myself to resolve this issue. i tried every pubg optimization guide out there. nothing was working. finally, i run out ideas so i decide to go grab a cheap external ssd hoping to speed up some load times on my $2,000 alienware laptop, that only has an hdd. 

my laptop is a few years old, but i've never had any issues with it really. just occasionally longish load times for demanding games. 

so off to best buy i went, and i grabbed a 240 gb pny ssd for about a hundred bucks. i come back, pop it in, aaaaand nothing. no new drivers detected. 

i checked out their tech support page and in the faq first thing that they suggest doing is updating your bios.

well i had never done that before, but i went over to the dell website and it looked easy enough. i had an a02 or something bios and it was going to update it to a09 or something for me. sweet!

so i launch the updater and it runs for a bit. looks good so far. then i see it say ""failed <something something>"" and closed itself immediately. uh ok.

i left my computer there without doing anything or opening anything for about 30 minutes. still nothing. tried searching for the msinfo or whatever to open system information but the start menu wouldn't search for anything. 

so in my infinite wisdom, i though well i just updated, let me go ahead and restart my laptop.

restart i did and restart my computer did not. 

it turned off, turned back on but nothing came on screen. the internal fan is blowing. the usb external fan i have is blowing. the keyboard backlights are lighting up. but nothing else has happened and it's been over an hour. i can't turn it off, not even by holding down the power button.

so now it's unplugged and i'm sitting here wondering how i'm going to kill time in the barracks with absolutely no other means of entertainment besides my phone, alcohol, and the gym.

i called alienware tech support and they offered me absolutely zero help without my coughing up 400 bucks. might as well go ahead and upgrade laptops instead of that. 

tried geek squad but their system was down and told me to try calling back tomorrow but i imagine it'll be something similar to alienware.

anybody out there have any advice to offer while i wait for my laptop to die so i can get some sleep (the fan is pretty loud)? i'm pretty sure my bios is just failing.

input: Text: so on reddit i saw a while back that taking a shit with your feet propped up on something makes it easier to poop. also read about weird shit people do like pooping completely naked or with the lights off. 

so as you can imagine, i figured why not try all three at once? surely this *trifecta* will change the way i poop forever in a good way? right? 


**wrong**

and it was only wrong because i decided to do it at a friends place. now his parents weren't home at the time and we were playing video games as usual when all of a sudden i got a rumble in my tummy. told him i was going to use the bathroom real quick so i run upstairs and go inside. that's when i remember all these neat things redditors do so i decided, fuck it, why not try it all right now? 


so i ""lock"" the door. see i thought i locked it but apparently it didn't turn all the way. feeling safe and secure, i get completely naked and turn off the lights. i didn't have anything to prop my feet on so here i am, butt ass naked, perched on the toliet seat like some poop gargoyle and i can hear the front door close. great, his parents are home. no worries tho, door is locked yeah? 

**wrong again**


so here i am naked, vulnerable, perched on the toliet seat in darkness when i hear footsteps walking up the stairs. i figure his parents are just gonna go to their room but no, his mom all of a sudden has to use the bathroom. since i had the lights off, she assumed no one is in there and since i thought i ""locked"" the door, i figured i was safe. 


but i wasn't. i can hear the fucking door knob turn and i realize i am completely fucked. she opens the door, turns on the light and sees me in all my naked, ass gargoyle glory. she lets out an audible wtf and walks out. 


she never said anything to my friend since hes never brought it up but i can never look her in the face again.

while driving back home he asked me for another favor which was to drop him off at his girlfriend's house. she doesn't live too far so i once again agreed. on the way there i needed to make a right turn so i turned on my signal to let the driver behind me know. before i made the turn, there were these pedestrians walking at an incredibly slow pace. the kind of walk that tells you they just don't give a shit about what happens. i didn't want to drive past them because i was afraid i was going to run them over. so i drove into the street just enough to let the other cars pass, but then suddenly i hear a loud pop. i look back and i see that the car behind me has it's trunk totally busted. i stop to see if everything is okay and the passenger of the other car tells me to just go. i was confused and shocked so i just did what she told me to. the whole drive home i was shaking and i felt sick. i still do feel sick. i'm confused on the idea of whether it was my fault or not. i hope they're okay.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i've debated for a really long time on whether i should post this or not, but every time i tell the story everyone gets a kick out of it. so whatever, here we go.

three months ago, i fucked up. my coworkers and i went to go see a concert at a giant outdoor pavilion. i live in houston and hate the awful traffic, and i hate this pavilion, so i was trying not to be so grouchy before the show... but i was not a happy camper by the time we got there. we finally parked and walked 50000 miles to the gates and i decided that i would rather buy shitty overpriced food than hear courtney love scream into the microphone on stage (we arrived as late as possible so that we wouldn't have to sit through her set). i bought pretzel chips and hummus and bottled water for a measly $10.50. we were trying to decide where to sit and i could barely hear anyone over love's slurring, and as we’re looking around i see nothing but beautiful people at this place. suddenly i felt super self-conscious of all these super pretty girls around me because i look so plain. so many flower crowns and crop tops. i'm no lesbian, but oh my god. i was severely under-dressed for this show and i was in such a bad mood already- i couldn’t wait to just sit and wait and then go home forever….

we settle in on the grass and sit. and wait. i eat my hummus and chips. and sit. i'm already sweating my tits off, i drank all my water and water is $4, so forget buying another one. i'm sweating and bored out of my mind, so i'm people-watching. since i'm feeling like i don't belong, i get this awesome idea to light a cigarette. smoking is easy and makes anyone look 150% cooler. i'm gonna smoke a cigarette. lana del rey smokes, and i'm here to see her sing tonight, so why not light up? it’s perfect. nothing can go wrong.

i ask one of my coworkers for a cig. she only raises an eyebrow at me.

""uhh, you don't smoke. these are my expensive american spirits, you're just going to waste it.""

""i just want to smoke one. i can definitely smoke the whole thing.""

""no, we'll just share.""

the fuck? it's my god given right as an adult to smoke a whole cigarette by myself! i beg and plead and she finally gives me one. after struggling to light it for about 30 seconds (it was slightly windy outside, ok), i get half of it burning. then i even it out. now we're cooking. i feel better. i'm taking small drags, trying not to cough. and she looks over at me to see how her budding addict is doing. she is such an enabler.

""you're not inhaling.” she says. “try it like this."" and she walks me through it.

i end up taking drag after drag with her coaching me on how to get more bang for my buck and suddenly i've smoked three quarters of a cigarette in less than two minutes. 

i know the effects of nicotine in the long run. obviously, addiction. the head rushes. nerves being calmed. i knew nothing of the short term effects, such as sudden nausea.

i feel my stomach betraying me and my throat getting ready to expel demons from my solar plexus. ""i don't... feel so good."" 

she sees the fear/panic in my eyes and shifts away from me. it's a good thing, too, because i pretty much ralph all over my hands as i cupped them under my mouth. i try my best to catch the vomit because i don’t want to throw up on my backpack that was in my lap. i lean over to wipe my hands off in the grass and clean them as much as i could. no one else has water or wants to waste their beer on my vomittens so i'm just coughing and shamefully wiping sick off in the grass in front of me.

this girl probably 3 or 4 feet in front of me must have heard me rejecting the chips and hummus and turns around to stare at me, screaming, ""that's fucking disgusting! how could you?""

yeah, no shit; it’s not like i'm having a party over here.

still in shock, i have no words for her, so she continues her tirade. ""you just puked on me.""

what? no. there's no way. there can't be. i caught it all. it’s in the grass.

with as much dignity as i could muster, i sort of choke out, ""i'm pretty sure i didn't."" and with that, she pulls her shirt away from her body and furiously points to three *huge* globs staining the back and side of her *white* shirt. it suspiciously looks like- *oh god*

she really did have nasty hummus/pretzel puke on her, somehow, and i have done nothing to help my case so far. so now that she has my attention, she dismisses me with a wave of the hand. ""just go get me some fucking napkins. and water, so i can clean myself off.""

in my post-puking haze, i somehow stumble up the grassy incline to the concession stand in the back and awkwardly ask the police officer there (the lines were long, and i wasn't going to interrupt someone) for a bundle of napkins, trying not to look drunk as fuck. feeling a bit better after moving around, i just awkwardly shamble back to my group and hand my accidental victim the whole stack of napkins i acquired, not taking any for myself. i'm just a wreck at this point, not feeling good, totally hoping no one around me is still watching. she and her friend immediately get up and move, thank god, now i won't have to stare at her back and my marksmanship.

a girl i barely just met that night leaned towards me and said, ""that is the best thing i've seen all night and you handled it really well."" everyone in my group agreed, and they reassured me when i tried to defend the girl i puked on. i did feel really bad, though. i probably ruined her night. i know mine was ruined. i laid down during the whole concert, so people probably thought i was drunk.

input: Text: this fu happened a few months ago and i promise, it's not bad as the title sounds -- though you can be the judge of that. 

our foster son is 3 and we've been working on potty training him (finally trained!!)
it was tough -- we tried everything: stickers, candy, cookies for rewards and of course the exaggerated cheers. but he just didn't what to do when the diaper was taken off. 
i think we made a mistake of trying to teach him to pee standing up to begin with. 
anyway, my wife figured that i should model peeing to him so he could at least get the picture of what we're trying to teach. 
he thought it was hilarious when i showed him how to pee. 
he loves everything water, especially splashing. so, he was thoroughly entertained at the sound of the pee hitting the toilet water, and he'd always lean over to see the pee hit the toilet. i made a mental note that some times he gets overly excited and i better watch out because i don't want to pee on him. 

well, one day it happened. there must've been a lint stuck at the end or something -- but all of us guys's have experienced this: when the pee stream splits. 
and sure enough of, one of the splits landed on his head. he started squealing in glee thinking this was a game. i was horrified and mortified so i yelled, ""move!"" (which -- according to the rules of fostering, i'm not supposed to yell at the kids) then i pushed him back (another no-no when it comes to the rules). he thought it was a game and tried to come back to toilet for whatever reason. in the mean time, i've stopped midstream and am freaking out trying to figure out what to do. i turn on the shower head and tell him to get in the shower (probably another no-no, since he's going into the shower by himself...?) and return to finish peeing after no longer being able to bear the burning sensation. 
he's just watching me finish peeing while playing with his wet hair. 

i felt awful and horrible. well, i still feel awful and while i hope he remembers lots of stuff from our time together, i hope this memory is long gone from his mind.

input: Text: tifu by scorning a friend and causing a baby. 

this happened my freshman year of high school. many years ago. certain details have come to light recently that have led to one great, big revelation. 

my freshman year of high school i was a friendship floater. i did have a strong core of friends, but my high school split lunches into 3 groups, and i happened to wind up separate from all of them. i make friends pretty easily, and one friendship that blossomed rather quickly was with this girl we will call sonya. 

midway through the year, after lunch, sonya asked me to the sadie hawkins dance. she asked me abruptly, completely out of the blue, and being the shy, oblivious adolescent i was, i thought she was joking. i actually laughed. in my next class, a mutual friend asked if sonya had asked me to the dance yet. i was floored. sonya wasn't joking after all - she was serious. crap, is what i felt like. 

i should've apologized and might have, but i think she started avoiding me. word had it she was pretty upset with my reaction, but when i heard she found a new date, i was resolved of the tension. 

the dance came around later that november, then we went off to christmas break, and when we returned to classes in the spring, i was assigned a new lunch hour. i was back with my friends and honestly, i didn't give sonya another thought. 

so, it wasn't until senior year, 3 years later, that i even thought about it. nobody had seen her at school, and she stayed pretty low-key, so somehow she hadn't come up in conversation in my presence. so, i checked whatever social media outlets there were, or perhaps i asked around, but i got to the bottom of it. she had gotten pregnant. her son was now two and a half. which put his conception immediately after that sadie hawkins dance. 

i'm happy for her. i feel bad about how i handled that invitation, but i'm very glad that's not my baby, as it so easily could have been. 

*they are married now, happily. their son is healthy. we aren't friends at all, as you might've guessed. maybe my obliviousness was the worlds way of putting these two soulmates together, but can't help but feel it it weren't for my idiocy, many lives would be a lot different.*

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this shit happened saturday night at roughly 9:30 pm. 

my friends and i go to the ihop to indulge in the pancakes and  breakfast. everyone is talking about life and merriment as we eagerly waited for our food to arrive. everyone got pancakes. i got chicken and waffles. 

""would you like honey mustard?"", said the waitress to me.

""uhhh, sure."", i said.

big mistake. the next thirty minutes were a mixture a foodgasmic taste experiences as well as grave regret. the syrup, soda and honey mustard were starting to get to me. everyone was done eating and already paying at the front counter.

""hold on guys, i gotta go to the bathroom."", i said while clenching my stomach and sphincter  in pain.

""k. try not shit all over the floor like you did at summer camp."", said friend 4.

""that wasn""t even me!""

i proceeded to the bathroom which to my surprise, had no one inside. what was an alleged code brown, was soon to be a code green. or more like code yellowish-brown. coughing and gagging my brains out and yet nothing came out. feeling like i had beaten the ihop, i left the stall and went to pay my bill.

we get into my car (we all carpooled there) but something was wrong. horribly, horribly wrong.

it was coming.

*rising stomach gurgle*

""oh fuck""

*i get out of the drivers seat and run to a light post*

*vomits on said light post""

""aww, what the fuck, man!?"", said friend 1.

""i'm sorry, it was probably too much honey mustard."", i replied.

""do you want me to drive?"", said friend 2 (the non-asshole with substantial medical knowledge).

""yeah, i'm not gonna make it on this one..."", i moaned.

we get about maybe fiddy yards away from the ihop when i start to vomit again. hard. 

blllllleeeeeuuugggghhhhhhh

the car stopped next to us is a four remembered middle eastern looking family. all of them filled with the faces of disgust. fucking priceless.

*collective duuuuudddesss from friends in my car*

""do i need to pull over?"", said friend 2.

""no, no, i'm fine"", i said obviously not fine.

thank god we were at a stoplight.

the light turns green and we start moving again.

""i'm going to try to drive slowly, okay?"", said friend 2.

""alright, i trust you."", i reluctantly cried.

maybe not even twenty seconds after the stoplight, i start vomiting again. hard.

blllllleeeeeuuugggghhhhhhh

none of it hits the ground. just the side of my car.

*fast forward to a few more stoplights of this happening*

we stop at yet another stoplight with me still feeling gurgley. this time, the car next to us is filled with african american individuals that may have been juniors in high school or freshman in college. i am very bad at guessing ages.

*loud as fuck gurgle*

""oh god.""

*stick head out of window and projectile vomit all over the car next to us*

yep.

you heard right folks.

all over their 4-door who-gives-a-fuck standard.

everyone in the vomited car, aren't disgusted, just surprised. the mix of facial expressions ranged from ""eeewwww"" to ""da fuuuuhhhh?""

i smiled and promptly apologized for the vomit to which the driver rolled down his window and replied ""ayo, you need to turn down, bruh!"".

tfw i believe him.

more vomiting out of the window onto the side of my car later ensued after that stoplight and continued until we arrived at friend 3's house. 

we got out of my car and saw the damage. 

it.

was.

everywhere.

dried up from wind resistance vomit caked in all across the right side if my car.

one of the poor bastards on that side came out that way and got a nice handful of chicken and waffles from the door handle.

after hardy laughter, we played basketball, watched some kind of gay (i mean actually gay) movie about singing and dreams with friend 3's sister, and left to go home.

all of the ride home, i had wondered what had made me sick. then it hit me. the honey mustard. i basically drank the whole bowl that the waitress brought me. i eventually arrived home at around 1 am. the perfect time for masturbation.

don't fuck around with honey mustard, kids. it may taste good but it can and will, fuck you up if drunken without moderation.

after putting off said paper more i decided to reheat some pizza for lunch (domino's pepperoni and bacon, delicious). set my slices on the paper towel, and heated for 45 seconds. added a little ranch, sat down at my computer to eat and work.

finished my pizza slices and saw that there was leftover bacon on the paper towel, score! i reached over for a piece of my bacon-y goodness and it looked like the napkin was about to fall off my desk. 

here's where i fucked up. i flinched ninja style to grab it, and in doing so, knocked it off the desk. 

now i have a floor covered in bacon, and worse yet, no bacon to eat. time to return to the paper bacon-less and a little wiser.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: fuck throwaways, i have no shame! i would also like to apologize in advance for any potential formatting issues, i'm on mobile and will fix them tomorrow.

it all started when i decided to bake bread last night at 2am like an idiot. when i woke up, i was quite groggy and bumping into everything. i was about to take a shower, when i noticed that i forgot a towel, so i went across the hall to get one. the hall is very narrow, and full of boxes because despite living in my apartment almost 4 years, i'm still not fully unpacked.

as i turned the corner to get to where towels are kept, i stubbed the pinky toe on my left foot. this is actually a regular occurrence in my home, but this time was different. the pain was binding. my brother, the only other person in the house, heard me through his headphones repeatedly shouting ""fuck! fuck! fuck!"" i looked down, and saw my toe red and bent in half. i yelled out to my brother ""i think i broke my toe!"" suddenly i couldn't stay on my feet. the last thing i thought to myself before i blacked out was ""i feel lightheaded.""

everything started dark, then out of nowhere i started experiencing the obelisk sequence from 2001: a space odyssey. then i started hearing these incoherent echoes. it felt like this went on for years.

suddenly, i came to, and everything looked and sounded fuzzy. i could barely make out my brother standing over me with his phone is his hand. turned out i passed out, and hit the back of my head with one of the boxes. my brother saw me lying there in my underwear not moving. he asked me if i was ok. i didn't move, but i started snoring. he didn't want to move me in case i had broken my neck or something. he shouted at me to wake up a couple times before he went to call an ambulance. he shouted one last time at me, and that's when i woke up.

he asked me if i was ok, but i still couldn't form words. i tried to get up, but i could barely sit up. everything was fuzzy and i heard a lot of white noise. eventually i said that i was ok and asked how long i had been out. he said about a minute. i told him i could've sworn it had been years. he laughed, and lent me a hand to get up, but i still didn't have control over most of my muscles. unfortunately, this also meant my bladder. i started to piss myself. i tried to hold it in, but i couldn't control it. as my brother watched me try to get up like a newborn baby deer, he laughed his ass of and told me what happened in my passed out minute. i finally got enough control to crawl to my bed. i flopped on there, making sure to lie on my dry side so i didn't cover my bed in urine. i looked down at my toe and saw it popped back to its normal place, but it was purple. i checked to see if i could move it and felt for a break. it was painful, but my toe felt normal. i figured i just dislocated it and probably pinched a nerve, hence the pain.

finally, i told my brother ""l peed myself."" of course, he laughed harder and told me i was gonna clean whatever puddle i left. when he made sure i was ok, he went back to his room.

it's a good thing i didn't have anything to do, because it was another two hours before i could shower. i was really lightheaded, and couldn't stand on my left foot. i still cleaned the piss of myself and the floor, and showered as soon as i could stand for a few minutes.

my best friends came over a few hours later, and i showed him my toe and told him everything that happened. he noticed it was really swollen and asked if i had been icing it. it hasn't occurred to me to do that since it's just a toe. he's been making me ice it for about an hour on and off now. [it still looks bad](http://imgur.com/c1yatdg), but not as bad before. three pain had been bad, but survivable. i'm also still really lightheaded and the white noise is on and off. i'm pretty sure i have a concussion. my phone is the only reason i can spell anything on here.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened several years ago when i was going to graduate school in nyc. if you've never had the pleasure of attending graduate school then let me say that it is like college on steroids in terms of alcohol consumption. i have never drank as much as when i attended graduate school (maybe to deaden the pain of a bad career choice, but i digress). now, while working towards your degree students are also expected to put in full time in a research lab of our choosing. i had a great lab experience with an awesome boss and some great lab mates. everyone was so awesome we would not only occasionally drink in lab (don't judge) but we would also go out and pretty much drink together every night (this is where all my graduate stipend money went i guess). there was one girl in our lab, we'll call her carol, whom i really got along with. great girl, we had pretty much the same sense of humor and many of the same interests. on this particular night carol and i and the other members of the lab were drinking late into the evening because we knew our boss would be out of the office the following day. carol and i also had a great love for tennis and we decided, since the boss was out, that we were going to sneak out of lab and play a couple of sets the next day. 
now, if you love tennis and you live in nyc then you  know all about the courts in central park. located near 96th street on the upper east side, these courts are iconic. you get a nice spread of pros and newcomers who play here. the courts are set up such that you walk through a fence to enter the first rows of courts and then walk through a second fence to get to the back row of courts. usually the best players, who the staff members were familiar with, were given the front courts and casual players were relegated to the back courts. the two center courts right in front of the entrance were usually reserved for the best of the best (many people would just come to watch play on those two courts). the tennis center has very strict rules about your shoes, your clothes, being on time, and observing all their regulations. in fact, there is one staff member (we called him the enforcer) who stands at the entrance to the courts making sure everyone follows the rules. back in the day if you wanted to reserve a court you had to get up early and get your ass over to the courts when they opened (6:30am) to sign up for a spot. sweet carol did this and informed me that day that she had reserved a court for noon on this particularly hot and humid summer day. she told me this when i rolled into lab still hungover from our drinks the night before. i guess i drank more than i intended but i still felt fine to play. 
the hour rolls around and we head over to the courts. now i should mention that i love tennis and have been playing since high school. i consider myself pretty good. carol was also a better than average player. on this particular day, since i was still feeling a bit drunk/hungover and it was a hot summer day at noon, we decided we wouldn't push ourselves too hard. so we get there, expecting to play our match on the outer courts, as that's what carol had signed up for. but when we reach the gates, the enforcer (whom i've been shamelessly flirting with all season to get better court placement) lets us know that one of the center courts has opened up and if we'd like to play there. before my slow brain can even process this carol enthusiastically says yes! fuck, now i know that our fun little match is out the window. center court is the real deal and they expect you to put on a show. 
so the game begins. i'm really putting in 110% - running down every shot, returning everything that comes on my side, even trying to put some speed on my serves. i'm putting in such effort, and it's so hot, that i'm starting to really sweat. at this point i'm starting to smell the gin from last night in my sweat. i'm also starting to get really winded and i notice black spots in my vision. you can probably guess what comes next. before i can even let carol know i don't feel well i pass out. i come to with carol by my side. i look up and the enforcer is not happy. he tells us to get off center court. i'm so embarrassed i just want to get the hell out of there. i'm just glad i didn't get us banned from the courts for the season! needless to say i spent the rest of the day in bed after taking a nice cold shower!!

input: Text: this happened like 10 minutes ago and i'm still cringing hard.

so i (19f) was changing my clothes in my room after a bike ride. it's a nice day so my windows were open and my room faces a street but not a very busy one, so i normally don't worry about people seeing me. i've gotten so used to this window being open that i didn't think anything of it until i see my co-worker ride by on his bike the exact moment i'm butt ass naked in front of my window. i stand there frozen for a second hoping he doesn't turn his head, but he does and then does a double take after which i hit the floor. 

so i'm hoping against all hope he didn't see me or if he did that he didn't know it was me. i have to work with him on monday. it doesn't help i'm the new girl, and one of only 2 female employees. fuck. i fucked up. learned a lesson about privacy, but damn.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i'm a late-20's male working at an ad agency. we don't have web content filters at my job, and everyone gchats all day because it's easier than calling each other or constantly walking around the office. anyway, i was reading a non-porn yet nsfw subreddit discussion, but someone linked to a very, very nsfw video that piqued my interest. i copied the link and pasted it into an email to my non-work account for home viewing pleasure. 

about a half hour later, my very attractive co-worker, who i am friendly with but not exactly bff's with, asked me for some copy. people do this all the time, and i quick open a document, highlight the requested info, copy it and paste it right into the chat. i do it about 20 times a day without even thinking.

except this time, i must not have actually hit copy, because when i pasted and immediately hit send, it was the very nsfw link i copied a half hour prior. i saw it as soon as i sent it, turned bright red, and immediately followed with disregard and sorry wrong link and please do not click but quite frankly the cat was out of the bag.

obviously i'm mortified, not to mention concerned about my employment status. i saw my co-worker a few minutes later and when i made eye contact she just said ""thanks"" and kept walking. so maybe she didn't click the link, or did and realized it was a mistake, or something. but it's an hour later and my palms are still sweating.

input: Text: for starters i work at a restaurant with a southern menu. lots of fried food essentially. moving on, i'm at home prepping some green chile stew. i need slow cooked pork for the recipe so i bought a pork shoulder, seasoned, seared, and slow cooked it. obviously, upon it's finishing, i have to taste it. amazing! pretty sure i've never done it this well. as i'm sealing most of it away in freezer bags i keep on eating it. moving on...

i wake up the next day feeling nothing to bad. i work evenings in a kitchen so i had a lot of time to chill. i go into work at 3 pm. immediately i realize my chef has left pulled pork in the oven for me to pull out (and of course taste). so good it makes me question what i did wrong for mine. now i realize that we are running low on pork belly. so i grab a slab of that and season it up and throw it in the oven. it cooks all night, 4-9 anyway. i have to taste it when it comes out, right? very good, it's basically bacon that wasn't cured and was slow cooked. 

not a very busy night, so around 9 or so i decide to make myself a cheeseburger. said cheeseburger might as well be referred to as a plug because i'm in agony right now. obviously the meat i ate before is contributing but the cheeseburger is the straw that broke the camel's back. every once in a while a small toot releases some pressure but i'm waiting for the coup de grace...

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: obligatory ""this didn't actually happen today"": this was several months ago, but i needed to lay low. this is so bad. 

i'm a premed student at a university and i'm majoring in biology (surprise surprise). in addition to my full time academic pursuits, i'm also doing as much meaningful extracurricular work as i can, and about a year ago, i started volunteering for casa. 

for the unfamiliar, casa stands for court appointed special advocate; basically, i get a case involving a kid who has been chucked into the foster system after being taken away from his or her parents (usually due to neglect, abuse, or some other awful event). my job is to ""fill in the gaps"" that the often over-worked, overwhelmed social workers on these cases cannot attend to, like making sure the kids get proper counseling or have rides to events, etc.

anyhoo, i get this case with a 15 year old boy. great kid, but like a lot of these kids, he has some serious behavioral problems and, also like a lot of these kids, probably has undiagnosed adhd. now that he's in the system, it gets diagnosed, and he's getting treatment. i pat myself on the back for following up on that psych eval. and proudly add a blurb about it to my court report for the upcoming hearing (which we, as casa, have to attend and even serve as witnesses at times). his case is soon closed (i came in on the tail end), and he is adopted by the fosters. yay. next case, here i come!

meanwhile, back in college, i'm taking this biochemistry class that seems to have been structured by hitler himself. normally i can handle the rough science classes. genetics? cake. ochem? get the fuck out of here, this place is for grownups. but this....

also around this time, i have just discovered the yik yak app because, in the wake of the news media orgy surrounding recent tragic events, i'm paranoid about the possibility of a shooting on campus, and yak seemed like a reasonable alert network. i quickly came to realize that it wasn't much more than a poor (and stupid) man's dark net market. i saw advertisements almost daily for weed, 'shrooms, lsd, ecstasy... and most commonly, all dosages of vynase, ritalin and adderall--aka, the great equalizers.

well, between my impossibly shitty test scores and my overwhelming schedule putting my focus and energy in the can, i caved and did something i never thought i'd do in my life--answered someone's blurb for ""15mg addy,"" got his kik, and set off with the agreed upon fifty bucks. you've probably figured out where this is going by now, but i want you to relive the horror with me. 

i pull up to an apartment complex in a familiar neighborhood, scared shitless because i've never done this before. i never smoked weed in high school. i never even had a prescription, aside from antibiotics. i consoled myself with positive thoughts. ""hey, foster kid's parents live just down the road! huh, neat."" i even considered paying the kid a visit after this ""transaction."" 

i must have the shittiest luck on the face of the planet, because i paid him a visit alright, while parked outside building 10 and waiting anxiously for a baggie of study buddies. he came up to my car window, drugs in hand, recognized me immediately, and took off like he was on fire. i sat in my car like an idiot for a few minutes, dumbfounded, before i finally hauled ass out of the parking lot and away from the scene.

i never heard anything from the kid or from anyone else, and i still shit a brick every time i see an email from my casa supervisor.

input: Text: so i have a serious anxiety, depression and ocd that i smoke medical pot for. i just moved out from living a year with my drug addicted mother who stole thousands of dollars from me and totalled my car. i’ve been in my new place for 8 days and my land lord phoned me just now and said she wants me out because she knows i’ve been smoking pot. i only smoked it on the property in the backyard once after her son said i could. then she said i couldn’t so every single time after i’ve smoked it off the property. also pot is in no way more important to me then having a place to stay. i asked her son who is subletting the house if it was okay and he didn’t see a problem with it. if he had even the slightest problem with it i wouldn’t of smoked it. i’m not being irresponsible with it. i’ve only smoked it 3 times since being here. and i don’t act all high and i even change my clothes so the house doesn’t smell. she said i need to be out by december 7th. i texted her this and tried to explain my side of the story. 

“i just want to say i’m so sorry if i was disrespectful. i really did not intend to be. i have a very serious anxiety disorder. it’s so bad i can’t even work. i’ve suffered my entire life from it. i also suffer from ocd. i used to take very addictive medicine. medicine that they don’t hand out like they used too called benzodiazepines. you can research them. they are both physically and emotionally addictive. i was on them for 5 years. i had to get off of them my body was becoming dependent on them. the withdrawals were so bad i cried for literally a month. every day i felt like i was about to die and cradled my self in the fetal position. then my doctor recommended marijuana. it’s a lot safer and more natural then what i was on. i don’t even smoke the kind that really gives you a head high. i smoke a strain called indica which is a body high. so your mind is very clear but your body feels relaxed. i smoked it once in the backyard. you told me not to so every single time after i’ve smoked it off the property. i don’t act all high. i smoke it and go lay in my room and thank god that my mind doesn’t have the harsh intrusive thoughts from my ocd and the fear in my head isn’t there. i’ve never ever smoked it in the house. nor would i ever do that. i buy it from a dispensary and i have a medical card for it. everything is legal. it is seriously a medicine for me.  i’m not playing around. i didn’t know i would have to disclose the medicine i take for my mental health conditions. if i don’t have to tell you the anti psychotics i’m on, why would i need to tell you the plant i smoke off the property for a serious medical condition. i’m not trying to be disrespectful. i just wanted to explain my side. i even asked your son and he said he was okay with it.” 

her only response was not to bring her son into it and i will get my notice tomorrow. 

can she evict me for using pot sincerely medically? 

edit: i’m in vancouver bc

i was bored at home and watching tv and saw someone doing the fluffy bunny challenge and i thought to my self ""challenge accepted."" i go to the kitchen grab a bag of marshmallows and started.

i got to twelve before the bag ran out so i decided to try eating them. i tried to swallow one and i started to gag, so i sprinted to the toilet and basically threw up 12 marshmallows. i flushed the toilet and walked away and tried to find something else to occupy my time so i started jerking off in the lounge as i'm home alone. once i finished i went to clean up so i chucked the tissues in the toilet only to find that there were still marshmallows. i frantically flushed the toilet only to find the marshmallows wouldn't flush, and they were covered in jizz and tissues. i frantically started searching for something to get them out. i ended up trying a bowl but it wouldn't fit then i had an idea, ""tongs!"" (i literally yelled this idea out loud). i grabbed them and started to try to grab the marshmallows out of the toilet and chuck them in the bin outside. on about the 4th marshmallow i realized the neighbor was outside and could see over the fence. so i decided i would ninja my way around the house with jizz soaked, tissue covered, toilet marshmallows. i got to about the 8th before i realized i'm going to have to thoroughly clean these tongs but i thought i could just boil the jug and sterilize them. now i had successfully ninjed?!? 12 jizz soaked, tissue covered, toilet marshmallows to the bin, now all that's left is too clean the tongs. this would have been fine if we didn't have a storm yesterday... which broke the fucking jug! now i have to think quick cause i got no clue when my mum will be back so i fulled the bath a little with hot water chucked the tongs in there and will probably take them out soon.

now i'm feeling lucky i'm having pancakes for tea.

we had a house party later and, with about 4 litres of beer in me, it turns out she's not out of my league after all. i walk her home, we make out a lot, i sleep in her bed, we make breakfast together. all very nice. no sex happened, we were both too drunk.

the next day we're texting and we decide to go out again later in the week.

now, in an attempt to provide context for my imminent seminal false start, when i say my friends 'house' it's more like a room with an en suite, that 4 of us were sharing. i stroke my schlong fairly regularly when i'm on my own, but with 4 of us in a room and paper-thin bathroom walls, there were no wanks to be had all week.

by the time my second date came around, i had been 6 days without ridding my balls of semen. it went really well, we went for a long walk, watched a film, made out some more, i probably could have made a move then, but i didn't. perhaps i would be telling a different story if i had.

we slept in the same bed again. sleep was going well, as it usually does, when for some reason i wake up. ""my dick's twitching, that's weird"" i think to myself as i drift back off to sleep.

we wake up and, what can i say, my underpants are a splooge filled mess. i mean, i suspect my dick better resembled a giant, slime covered slug than a functional penis. turns out my dick twitching was in fact that, post-cum, blood leaving the dick dance.

of course this is the time when the making out heats up. she puts my hand between her thighs, but all i can think of is how weirded out she's going to be when her hand ventures south and finds the path to glory coated in my man juice.

eventually with no progress made she decides it's time for her to go shower and get dressed. i left my friend's city without seeing her again, walking into the proverbial sunset, jizzed soaked boxers in hand and virginity intact.

cut to the end of 5th period, which is math for me. the bell rings and my friend comes in and bumps into me, so i say, ""watch out, dickface?"" and then giggle a bit. suddenly i hear a ""what the fuck did you call me?"" i look up and it's somebody i have never seen who looks identical to my friend is in front of me clenching his fist. he was expelled from two schools now for fighting. so now i am not only in his 5th period, but also sit by him. as if i didn't hate the class enough.

 

edit: i apologized, but they didn't believe me. it didn't help that my asshole friend pretended not to know me. i'll talk to him tomorrow and update after school.

update: well, they're suspended for punching someone else and then kicking their balls. i should be fine as long as i get my seat moved.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i'm an american student who's been living in germany for a little over a year now and i love it. i've been dating a german girl and it's left me with a strong desire to be fluent in the language and to learn more about the culture in general.

the fuck up in question occurred last weekend as i was on my way to visit munich. i had used a popular ride sharing website to arrange a car ride with a german guy, let's call him wilhelm. we met on the determined morning and it was all going well. wilhelm was in his late 50's, and was wearing a tucked-in collared shirt and dad jeans. he had also brought his young granddaughter (8ish?) for the ride. 

he was definitely a morning person. within 5 minutes of the drive, he was in full-on smalltalk mode. that's ok with me though; i like getting to know people and this was going to be a 4 hour drive after all- it would be good to have some rapport during the journey. we covered a wide wide array of topics- why we were heading to munich, soccer teams, cars, ect. and during which time he seems to like me and offers to drop me off at my hotel even though it is somewhat out of the way for him. wilhelm is the man! 

the conversation eventually dies down so i decide to do a bit of reading. i've read harry potter so many times in english that i have it pretty much memorized, so i borrowed the series in german (from my girlfriend) which has been really helpful for me. now normally i'm not a bookmark kind of guy. i feel like bending the pages is part of the process of discovering a book, but my girlfriend isn't in that camp so i decided to respect her wishes had been using a postcard as a bookmark. the thing about the postcard is that it was sent to me by a friend, and it was a pretty funny depiction of a hung ass fertility god and a cartoon blonde woman running hungrily towards it yelling ""oh my god!"" 

i'm on book 4 now, and had been using this since book 1 (der stein der weisen) so the naughtiness of my bookmark wasn't at the forefront of my mind. i opened the book and there it was, gloriously holding my spot in the book. the only thing is that the granddaughter was also a big harry potter fan too, and excitedly peered over my shoulder when she saw the book (i was in the front seat) to see what part i was at. she was expecting to see something about the triwizard tournament or mad eye moody, but was instead greeted by the sight of a monstrous phallus. i will never forget the look of betrayal and confusion she gave me. or the german death stare of wilhelm. 

needless to say, he did not end up dropping my off at my hotel.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so, this didn't happen yesterday but in july. me and my lady have been together for 7 years today (but got married in july 20th), so i thought it'd be good time to share this story.

the night before the wedding me and my bestman went to our local small pub to have a couple of pints. (the pub and the wedding place are in the region we used to live in when we were younger.) we talked about the next day and how my life had come to this and so on, i even talked how i wasn't scared or anxious. we even saw some of my friends from another town (where me and mrs. live nowadays), so we had two more beers each. so when we got to bed it was like 3 am and we had to get up at 8. so not too much sleep for the night, and the next day would be a big one.

well, despite my lack of sleep the next day was perfect. fucking flawless. i was so goddamn scared at the altar before my soon-to-be-wife entered the main hall, but still it was marvelous. a friend performed a song by enya with her violin at the church and our wedding march (or is it hymeneal in the us?) was outro by m83, so i couldn't hold back the tears.

the party itself was also so great, even though i feared beforehand that i'd get too drunk at my own wedding. we partied till 4 am, and then everyone ordered cabs, including me, the wife and our siblings and cousins. since the place was at the countryside, we waited for our taxi for an hour. and during that time i drank the last bottle of champagne by myself and had fun with the remaining guests.

the taxi arrives, i hop in, and pass out immediately. i remember everything except the cab ride. when the taxi arrived to our hotel, nobody could wake me up, so my now-wife just stood there and laughed her pretty little ass of while our friends, four of them, carried me to our suite, the bride giggling behind us. or so i heard. they even tried to take off my suit, but eventually gave up and went to their own rooms.

midday. i wake up. i feel quite... moist, so to speak. i immediately knew what happened. thought: ""no fucking way, not here, not now. not again."" my bonjour-suit and the 3000 dollar bed were soaked. pee all over. this wasn't the first or the second time it had happened, but you know, this time it really ruined my morning. and morning wood. so there we were, lying in my piss, drinking champagne and eating grapes and enjoying the first day of our marriage.

input: Text: first of all this community is out in the boonies and most of the adults in it belong to this web forum.

we live in an area of the west with mountain lions and lately the mountain lions have been killing a lot of pets and livestock. we also have a lot of other predators around here like coyotes and so on.

anyway someone got on the forum and was complaining about something ridiculous. he was saying that the government is at fault for not putting up fliers about the mountain lion kills recently. and he said due to that they are at fault because his neighbor's cat was killed by a mountain lion recently. he said they are all morons because they didn't put up the fliers.

anyway i was very annoyed by that and wrote a long-ass whole lecture about how people who choose to live in a wild area needs to take responsibility for themselves and secure their own animals. and not blame it on a flyer. i also said that anyone who lets a pet cat roam around outside in this area is irresponsible. i also wrote quite a bit about mountain lions explaining certain things about them like how fences don't keep them out and things like that. when i wrote my lecture, i used the word cats interchangeably with the word mountain lion. because around here a lot of people refer to mountain lions as cats or as the big cats because that's what they are. then i wrote even more about pet cats and how i'm sorry when they get killed but it's their owners fault for letting them out.

i wrote this all on my phone, posted it, and then stuck my phone into my pocket.

now this community forum is on facebook and facebook has those stickers you can put in your comments. one section of the stickers is images of a big fat cat doing different things.

when i pulled my phone back out of my pocket at the end of the day i saw that my phone had added many more comments to this thread right after my rant about cats. they were all stickers. they are all the stickers of this big fat cat which i have never used before my life. the cat was riding a scooter. the cat was baking cookies. the cat was rolling around showing its belly. like 6 or 7 new comments from me with nothing but those stickers.

nobody replied. i'm taking a break from this forum for a while.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: **tl; dr** i didn't realize instagram would tell my wife i followed some girls who like to post pictures of their butts. 

i've been *really* slow to get on the smartphone bandwagon, but i just received a tablet for christmas. so yesterday morning i downloaded the instagram app and signed up. i *deliberately* told the app not to use my contacts, facebook, or other info to look for connections for me... but then i got to the app's list of suggested accounts to follow. and whaddayaknow, in that list are people i know personally, several semi-famous hot girls whose instagram i've occasionally looked at on my laptop, and a bunch of accounts related to a hobby of mine. that immediately *pissed me off*: i *just* told the app not to look at my contacts and other info. in particular, i cannot imagine how instagram knows about my hobby. anyway, i figured ok, i'll follow a few of these girls and one of the accounts related to my hobby. maybe later i'll unfollow the girls if i actually decide to use this account, but for now, whatever, it'll be nice to look at their pictures for a few days.

fast forward to last night. my wife and i are sitting next to each other on our couch. she's looking at her phone. she says, ""hey, when did you get an instagram account?"" my thought: *what the absolute fuck.* why in the fucking fuck does instagram feel the need to tell my wife that i got an account? also, what planet are we on that they think it's acceptable not to *tell me* that this will happen? especially after i declined to let the app use my contacts.

a minute later, my wife says ""who is *hot girl's name*?... oh."" 

now my wife is not necessarily excessively jealous, but this was hurtful to her (as i knew it would be). she is ok with me looking at porn (and sometimes watches it herself), but me actually following the (non-pornographic) accounts of specific girls hurt her. one oddball thing is that all the girls i followed were brunettes, which feeds into her already existing suspicion that i prefer brunettes (i don't), which she is not. also, a man having an instagram account just to follow hot girls is something both of us would generally see as pretty lame, so it kind of made me look pathetic in her eyes.

anyway, i did fuck up, but also, *fuck instagram*. holy fucking shit. i mean, maybe this is considered normal behavior to people who have been using these dumbass mobile apps for years, but to me, this is beyond the pale. don't look at my contacts, don't look at my web history, don't broadcast to the world that i'm following these girls (i actually tried to look up whether people could see who i was following, and was led to believe that they could not), and *absolutely* don't email people to tell them about my account.

*not to mention*: did instagram email *everyone* in my email contacts who has an instagram account to tell them about my new account? that is seriously embarrassing. *fuck instagram*.

imagine if reddit pulled this shit. you sign up for an account you believe is anonymous, make a couple posts to /r/picturesofgirlsasses or /r/horribleracistsubreddit, and reddit emails a bunch of people you know to tell them about your new account.

fuck facebook and linkedin too for good measure.

**edit** to add: i also find it pretty disturbing that apparently quite a few people here have no problem with instagram's policy in this regard. it's as if i bought some condoms at the store down the street, and the cashier spent hours using my credit card number to find whatever records he could about me, combing through all kinds of records to find out who my family and friends are, to call them all and tell them i just bought some condoms. and then somebody on reddit says, ""that's your own fault, mate."" ???

the only difference is instagram can do all that record-combing instantly.

(for the record i am a first year uni student and puts much work in my academics to keep up my scholarships; not going into personal life but i need all the monetary help i can get)

so the previous two weeks i wrote my midterms and this week i am receiving the marks back. i had high hopes for this class in particular; i had done pretty shit on the assignments and was really hoping that this midterm, worth 25% of my grade would help boost my grade. it helps that i put a lot of time in studying and i had finished the midterm early, feeling pretty confident with my mark.

so, on the last class of the week, i felt my heart leap when i saw i barely passed (51%).

it only took a few seconds of flipping thorugh the exam to figure out where i went wrong.

somehow, i had stopped at question 50.

maybe it was the layout of the scantron (multiple choice card) which stops at 50 at the front. perhaps it was the way the exam was structured as to place a nice even 50 at the bottom of the 3rd last page. but somehow, my brain reached the nice logical conclusion that i was done now, i could go home.
so now, i will proceed to get black out drunk tonight as i am possibly at risk of losing most of my funding of education.

input: Text: **some background info:** this happened when i was 11 and i was an **extremely** sensitive kid, i mean i would cry just to prove a damn point, yes i was one of those kids, fortunately i am not like this anymore (thank god).

  
now this happened around christmas, now my school back then used to have a program like valentine grams, but my school apparently just needed so much more money so they had these grams for every single holiday they could find on the calender. so we had christmas grams. now it was the day before christmas break would start, i was all happy and my class was having a christmas party instead of normal class. now the grams always would come in the morning, and they did come. now you had the choice to make the grams anonymous now the people come to the door and call out a few select people to come get them then all of a sudden it was ""ok we have one for whotella"" ""wait we have another one"" ""never mind that we have one more for you"". i got three christmas-grams. they were basically the cliche secret admirer bullshit, if my memory serves me right i think one said ""i find you pretty"" (i am a guy by the way). basically i begin being curious because i am thinking: ""damn, a girl finds me attractive, i better hunt her down"". so i begin asking around everyone in my class and they all say ""i know who sent it, but they told me not to tell"" this made me angry. i was demanding to know who this damn girl was. then recess came, i asked around people who were in another class and they all helped me. i am extremely confused at this point. recess is over, we go back inside, i ask around again, same responses, other recess, same routine as last time, and now its last period. now i am desperate to find out who this girl is before i christmas break, and for some stupid reason i break down and begin crying basically demanding for people to tell me who it is, and then the teacher brought me out in the hall and told me that it was all a prank that my good friends, m,b and c planned out and told the whole entire class about. 

**how they pulled it off:** basically, i was and still am a very gullible person and they knew that so they exploited that, as well as my friend, b has very neat, but feminine looking hand writing and even added little hearts for dots on the i's. they were the favorites of the class so they managed to get the teacher in on it quite quickly and were also quite popular and managed to get the majority of the class in on it as well. they are no longer my friends. (that isn't because of that, its just because of class changes and a bunch of stuff).

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: throwaway account. this happened yesterday. i think maybe i will be able to laugh about this in the distant future but right now the amount of embarrassment is killing me.

i'm a 28 yo girl currently working two low-paid jobs that i despite. i live for the weekends which i spend either, a: beeing drunk and having fun with my friends or b: hanging out with my so.

my so, lets call him pete, has his own friends and doesn't really hang out with my friends. i have a very close childhood friend, lets call him chris. now chris isn't just gay, he is super duper gay and i love him for it. pete doesn't love him at all tho. 

this is where i fucked up. it's chris birthday. he's having a party  and i'm giving him a big black buttplug as an inside joke. it had a note attached saying ""use me or die trying"". like i said, inside joke. i was working both of my jobs yesterday and was late for the b-day party. when i got there i realized i had forgotten the buttplugg at home. i had to go back home and fetch the gift. chris was very kind and wanted to follow me, knowing he had a gift waiting for him. when we get into the hallway we hear a little weak scream followed by a ""nooooooo"". then i see pete in the livingroom. in front of a big mirror. naked. on his knees. with the big black buttplug up his ass. i don't know how many seconds we stood there just staring at him. then we slowly walked out of the apartment in complete shock. chris looked at me and asked ""was that my gift?"" we went back to the party and everyone asked me if i was feeling okay and telling me i looked sick. i was feeing sick.

now i'm back at home. no signs of pete. i don't know what to think or feel. still in chock. 

edit: got a text from pete. he has been on a bender all night and crashed at his friends house. he wants to meet later and ""tell me like it is"". i don't know what to think, it all feels very surreal. 

edit 2: talked with pete. turns out he likes all kind of anal stuff. haha funny, right? nope. can't believe he has keept all this from me. i'm disgusted and feel sick to my stomach. i think this is the end of our 3 year relationship.

input: Text: so this just happened, and i just created a throwaway account because my friends know my normal username.

well.... i just did the stupidest thing i have ever done. so today i decided up to stay up at night and play video games, browse reddit while my parents were sleeping, typical teenager stuff, and halfway through the night i had a great idea of reading nosleep and creepypasta. i just finished up a horror story when i decided that i should probably go to sleep. but then i realized i needed to use the toilet. shit. i didn't want to go out at night just after reading all those horror stories, so i decided to hold my bladder until i woke up in the morning, but my pee kept me from falling asleep. i was kinda desperate, so i looked around and grabbed a sock from my drawer. it was simple. i would simply insert my dick into the sock, and pee just like i was jizzing. if my jizz stays inside the sock, my piss can.

well. it didn't. i pissed in complete darkness with the lights off, and i knew that i was fucked when i heard the sound of my urine splashing onto the floor. after i finished up, i turned on my desk lamp and ended up stepping in the puddle. i then grabbed clumps of tissue from my desk and cleaned up my miserable mess on the floor. there's still a few drops of piss under the bed, but i ran out of tissue to clean it up, i'll probably rush to the toilet in the morning and grab some toilet paper and soap to cover up the smell and remaining piss. oh yeah. and i got my slippers soaked as well.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i work in a small office, less than 30 people, and we all are up in everyone's business. for a couple weeks, we were all displaced due to construction on one end of our office space. this meant that i was staring right at our receptionist. 
i'm a pretty straight-up person: you do your job, i like you. you don't do your job, i don't like you. she was not doing her job. she let the phone ring 5-6 times before answering or waited until one of the ""back-up"" guys would pick it up so that she wouldn't have to. she would stare at the same piece of paper all day, not moving at all, so that she would look busy. she would not wear her headset and leave the reception area and ignore the ringing phone. the phone is literally her #1 responsibility. 
so, feeling like i should say something since she's literally ignoring our customers, i tell the hr guy that i see these things. i explicitly say that i'm not trying to be mean or rude, but she's ignoring customers who are coming to me and my team upset by this. 
instead of talking to me, the hr guy goes to my supervisor, tells her that i said this, and she tells *me* to mind my own damn business. okay then!

fast forward to today, where i am running late for like, the 5th day in three weeks because of my depression and traffic intermingling. i didn't tell my boss because i was hoping to make it in before anyone noticed- but before i get to work, my phone pings with an email stating that she knows i'm not there, and i need to get my ass into work.
hmmmm, now who would tell my remote boss that i'm not there? perhaps the receptionist that i pissed off?

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so, unlike most other submissions in this subreddit, this actually happened today.

so, let me give a small backstory, i am a high school senior, and so is this girl (just for privacy's sake, let's name her ""mary""), who is easily one of the most attractive people in the school. we both have advanced placement computer science class at the end of the day. i tend to keep to myself most of the time, unless someone needs help with writing one of the programs we're working on (java, ugh). in that case, either i go to them or they come over to me.

so, i was just sitting there, listening to music, when out of the corner of my eye, i see mary headed in my direction. not sure if she was headed to me, i casually took off my headphones, looked in her direction and gave a slight smile. she pulled up a chair next to me and immediately began asking questions about the assignment we were working on. after helping her out, she asked if i was going to homecoming. she wasn't the first person to ask this question, so i just recited what i told the previous 4 or 5 people, which was ""probably not, i'm not really into dances that much."" she followed up with ""well, do you want to go?"". here is my fuck-up: i barely got any sleep the night before, so i was well beyond tired and didn't realize the significance of that question, so i responded with ""no, not really. i mean, i haven't gone for the past three years."" she then got a really confused look on her face, then just said ""oh, okay"", stood up, then returned to her desk area.

i didn't really think much of it, until i got home, then it hit me. now, i feel like shit and have no idea how to recover from this.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: here is a tiny bit of backstory to help clear up why i did what i did.  my biological mother divorced my father when i was but a small child.  too early, even, to have any memories of her at all.  because my father was in the military and she a non us citizen, both parties moved around a lot and quickly lost contact with one another.  i hadn't heard from her at all throughout my childhood, my teenage years, and even my college years, but not for lack of trying, mind you.  anyway, she finally found me a few years ago thanks to the magic of facebook.  being the forgiving guy that i am, i instantly welcomed her back into my life, and she took that chance to fly me to korea to visit her and the family i never knew over there.  but because i didn't have much vacation time with my current job, i was only able to afford them nine days (i had ten, but i lost a day flying there).  

&nbsp;

as you can imagine, that isn't much time to get to know the family you never knew.  so i decided i would use more vacation time this year and buy tickets for myself to korea.  i did so through the airline's website directly, but me being such a naive little twit and not reading everything all the way through, i ended up purchasing non-refundable tickets.  what's more, i upgraded my seats on both the flight there and the return trip.

&nbsp;

after a couple of months of passing, my mother messaged me, asking me to change the dates i was visiting to a different month, because the originally agreed upon dates were no longer good for her.  i contacted the airline and they helped me change the date... for an extra $400.  keep in mind i had spent $1,100 for the ticket, and roughly a little over $200 for the upgraded seats.  but this was my mom, the fee would be worth it to be able to see her again.  

&nbsp;

but then she contacted me again... because of the mers virus and apparently she was getting married, this year was going to be no good for her at all.  i could have possibly gone to visit everyone else, but only she and her brother knew english.  he wouldn't have been able to stay with me the entire time, so i would have been with my family twiddling my thumbs because i'm terrible at learning things without a teacher, and i can't find a way to really learn korean where i am.  so i cancelled my reservation and found out how badly i fucked up...  with the non-refundable tickets, i just basically donated $1,700 to the airline.  i contacted customer relations twice, and both times they referred me to the refunds department, because they're the only ones who can handle refund disputes.

&nbsp;

would you like to know how to contact the refunds department for this airline?  there are only two ways, through fax, or through the mail.  yeah, they didn't have an email nor a phone number i could contact them through.  so i wrote them a letter and sent it to them.  they finally responded to me yesterday and told me that i was out of luck.  they would not refund any money to me, they would not give me any credits towards another flight in the future, and they're not even going to let me transfer the ticket i have to another person.  the ticket is valid for up to a year after purchase, but i purchased those tickets in february.  i'm moving this year, so i had to use my vacation for that.  january and february won't be good months for my mom next year...  just out of luck.  also, i would have to pay another transfer fee to use them on another date.

&nbsp; 

i know this is entirely on me for not reading enough and purchasing a non-refundable ticket.  but to lose that much money is really painful.  and to be treated like i was really sucked.  i did give several months notice that i could no longer make my flight.  not like this was a last minute thing.  i explained to them my reasoning, that because my mom couldn't be there (the very person whom i wanted to see), i no longer could make my trip.  alas, my efforts were in vain.  this isn't nearly as bad as some of the things in here, but it doesn't help my wallet.  also i have to put off seeing them another year entirely, because it's not easy to save up that kind of money in less than a year.

i explained that this was an honest mistake and that the woman looked like my coworker and that i failed to notice him. he cooled down a bit and said ""i know some people think i look like a girl but you can't be doing that."" this was by no means funny to me.

i had been intentionally making eye contact with him avoiding looking at the bat and he continued to let me know that the bat ""was not for playing ball"" and ""was for doing work."" i had no response but nodded affirmatively. he then ordered me to apologize to the woman. i explained myself and she stared me down like there was a legitimate chance i might be bat-terried. i told him to have a good day and he told me to be safe.  i walked off as quick as i reasonably could.

the majority of the people i met at the beach i had never met were in no way entertained by my bat-shit story.

i met with some friends later and told them the story they seemed concerned but in no way surprised, as this sorta stuff just happens to me.

anyway fast-forward to about 3 months ago.  these games had been sitting on my headboard untouched, other than dusting the boxes off.  that night i had went out with my brother and a few of our friends.  we just get loaded on beer, jager, and the like. possibly close to $150 each in liquor.  when i got home i went and laid on my bed.  after a while i started feeling queasy and all of sudden a volcano of puke and regret came up, cover not only myself, my bed sheets, mattress, curtains and my entire head board.  i rolled over and slept it off.  when i woke up in the morning i looked around and was like omfg there's puke everywhere. (felt like bob saget).  looked around and then it hit me.  the boxes of my whole set are covered in puke.  cover is a understatement. they're caked in puke.  i tried rubbing off the boxes and nope.  in the end i sat there and cried in shock and dismay of what i had done.

i think that this is enough for the day and go home. the next day i come back and fire up my laptop. for some odd reason i can't find any wifi networks. everyone else is also confused. turns out that the routers were removed on the account of too much data usage. everyone else was pissed, they only used it for youtube and facebook. i was the only one who download a shit ton in a short amount of time. no one else knows it was me. the worst part is that i can't play the witcher yet!

input: Text: reddit.. today i fucked up.

here i am, little old 16 year old skadz, getting out of third block here in sunny senegal, just waiting for school to end so i could go home and enjoy my weekend. of course, me being me there was no way that would happen. during third block i started getting cramps in my stomach, i quickly realized this was due to the fact i have not shit in three days. now, i'm sure some of you have done this before, and know the feeling. but to those who are normal and shit regularly, here's what not shitting in three days feels like. it's.. it's horrible... imagine cramps every small movement you make, every small movement.. it's like being eaten from the inside out, along with what feels like your shit trying to claw its way out of your mouth.
         anyways, back to the story reddit. i quickly and badly realized i needed to go to the bathroom. so soon after third block ends and i head to the bathroom with my five minute break, i come to realize that what i was taking was not a shit.. no, what it was could only be described as giving birth through your asshole to a massive black turd. this lasted over and over again, and then resulted in my fourth eye spewing little nuggets every where during the whole 4th block. after school has ended i leave and walk right past my math teacher. the one whose class i was supposed to be attending. she says, ""go to the nurse, go to the principle then come back to me."" i do as i was tasked. nurse says she can't help me, oh well. i go to the principle's office. he isn't there, oh well. i go to her class, she informs me that she has sent an email to my mom and has also filled out a form reporting me for skipping her class, to the principle... i'm furious, but i manage a ""have a nice weekend,"" and i leave. 

now reddit.. now i'm waiting for my mom to arrive home so that i get my shit-pushed in.

update: heard some meowing outside a few hours ago and went to check on it. sure enough, our cat made her way back. however in our grief, we failed to communicate and ended up bringing home another cat a piece plus a new puppy. went from 2 cats, to 1 cat, to 4 cats and a dog.

cut to a couple hours later when i was up in my room and looking forward to a good fap. i got pornhub revved up on my ipad and i was ready to go, but for some reason there was no sound on the video. this guy needs a little sound in his porn, so i switched to another video. same thing. i turned the volume all the way up. nothing. then it dawned on me: my mother's iphone didn't connect to the speakers because something else was already connected (you can only connect one device at a time). my friggin' ipad was connected to my very powerful speakers and i had just blasted porn at full volume. i walked downstairs and mother had this freaked out look on her face. she said she heard a russian woman screaming in the house and she couldn't tell where it was coming from. she was actually scared. i told her i'd figure it out and it was probably from the tv.

thank god i was watching russian porn. that cuckold stuff i normally play wouldn't have been so easy to excuse.

input: Text: **to set the scene**

i recently moved across the country and now i live in an apartment with a self locking door. next to the door is a much smaller door with a latch and sliding lock. the door goes to a small spot to put trash for the janitor to collect. on the landing for the stairs there is a bookshelf with many old hard cover books on it (a sort of lending library). also my phone broke on july 4th and a replacement is being mailed to me.

**the start of it all**

i got home from work threw everything in my pockets on the coffee table and decided to do some laundry. as soon as i heard the door latch i checked my pockets and realized i didn't have my keys. i walked down the hall and asked to borrow a neighbors phone to call the property management company. i call and get an automated response informing me the office is closed until monday.

**where i fucked up**
 
at this point i'm thinking it's either live in the hallway for 2 days or break down the small trash door. so, i wedge myself in the spot where the trash would be and position my back against the door and push off the opposite wall with my hands. i can hear the door creaking and feel the bottom right corner moving. after giving that a try for 2ish minutes i crawled out and gathered some hard cover books from the lending library. this time i put my feet against the door with my knees on the opposite wall. when i got the door pried open enough i put a book in the opening to hold it. i kept repeating the process until i popped off the bottom hinge. eventually the gap was big enough to get my arm through. i was able to reach the sliding lock but because the door was bent the locking mechanism wouldn't budge. i kept going with the book and leg method until the door was at a 30° angle from the ground. the door was being held on by just the sliding lock and the top hinge.at this point i was able to wiggle my way through the gap and into the apartment.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i went to marine corps boot camp (parris island) about five years ago and being 18yrs old at the time.  deciding the next 3 month would be hell i wanted to have a little fun and threw a party where i later hooked up with a girl (no condom).  fast forward that next day at the military entrance processing station (meps); i notice a little red dot on the top side of my penis…at the time not seeing the urgency i decide to dab some soap on it and keep it on overnight.  waking up the next day i saw no growth so i figured it would go away on its own. 

 so there i was the first day of boot camp “receiving week”.  by about the second day i begin to have serious concerns because the dot had now grown to the size of about a half dollar.  my anxiety was beyond high because i knew i couldn’t last the next 3 months with this itchy red rash growing by the day!  on the day when the drill instructor asked us does anyone need to go to medical regretfully, i sounded off along with about three other people.  he went down the line asking what was wrong with each one of us, then he gets to me and to set the scene properly i want you to know a few things:
this di was one of the biggest darkest black men i have ever seen, he had a big space between his front two teeth and when he talked he had this deep slow southern accent, where he didn’t have to yell to put fear in you.  me:  an 18yr, 5’8, 130lbs, ghostly white guy from the suburbs of rhode island.  there are about 80 guys in the room lined up on both sides of the barracks floor, silent all but the drill instructors in the area.
getting back to the story, he comes to me and i tell him i have a rash on my groin, he looks at me funny and says and i will never forget it “show me your dick” i manage to stammer something out like “here?” and  he quickly came back at me more sternly “show me your dick!”.  red faced and fumbling to undue my belt and buttons i flopped it out my inflamed red flaccid penis. the di responds with only “you nasty muthafucka” paused then tells me form to up with the rest of the pussies.   it didn’t take him long to tell all the other di’s about me and sure enough a little while later had about 3 di’s just laughing at me and telling me how small my dick was and all i could do was sit there and take it. 

 i finally made it to medical where of course i get a female doc, attractive at that.  and this only stresses me out even more.  when i told her what was wrong she almost had this attitude like she didn’t believe me or trust me.  she advised me to pull it out and put my hands behind my back.  she looked at it and said wow that’s pretty bad…i’ll prescribe you something.  i won’t bore you with the rest of the story but i’ve had some other embarrassing and stressful moments but this really stuck with me through the years.  sometimes i feel like the bad luck brian meme was made for me.

update: not sure exactly what it was probably some kinda ringworm or yeast infection type stuff, the doc used a medical term i cant remember.  got some cream for it and a week later it disappeared.  spent the following week in broke dick platoon.

input: Text: so she asks why i don't want a boy, i look at her and just want to laugh, with the way men are treated in this damned country, like kings while the women are servants?, no, i don't want to raise a boy, but instead i tell her;

""the real reason why i want a girl, it's because i am desperate  for a mother daughter relationship, the type i always dreamt and cried for.the type of relationship where my daughter can ask me anything  and i'll answer her, the type where she'll hug and kiss and me and i'll tell her i  love her till death, and  i'll let her know that men are not more important than her but everyone is equal. and things won't be awkward most of the time, when i pick her from school she will run up to me and hug me with a huge smile on her face, i'll  joke and laugh with her, i would teach her about periods, sex etc, not tell her what you told me, go through the good and bad with her, never tell her when she does some bad things it's because of her gender. and i'll love her unconditionally and let her know that"".

my parents looked at me and said, "" you're really stupid, why would you want only one child and a girl at that, who will continue your husband's line, besides no such relationship exists?"".

i give up.

but in all honesty, do those types of mother daughter relationships exist or am i just tripping

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened a few days ago.

i was on my way to our base (i live on a american army base in germany) from a soccer game on a bus that was provided for my team (i'm 15 f) and it was not crowded at all. just ten of my team mates, the coach, and the bus driver. 

we stopped at burger king to get something to eat since all of us brought money and we were hungry. i ordered chicken nuggets, a large soda, and fries. all was well and we got back on the bus after we ate. 

about ten minutes later, i had to use the bathroom. i thought i could hold it in for the next 2 hours. boy was i wrong. thirty minutes later, i thought my bladder was going to burst. i literally had a lump in my throat and i felt like crying. 

i brought the soda on the bus and it was halfway full. i obviously wasn't thinking straight since i had the brilliant idea to pee in the cup while the bus was moving...

i said i wanted to go to sleep since i was tired and moved to the very front of the bus. the seats in front of me was close together so the bus driver couldn't see anything. i gulped down the rest of my soda pulled my baggy soccer pants down and attempted to do it. i got too paranoid and then got the brilliant idea to ask my friend to borrow her blanket. she brought a blanket since it was cold that morning and she tried to sleep.

i went back to the back of the bus, got her blanket and went back to the front. i wrapped the blanket around me, thankful it was big. i had to slant the cup a little so i didn't have to lift my ass too much. 

then while im peeing in my burger king cup, my friend comes, sits beside me and asks if i also wanted to use her pillow, which she held out to me. she did this as i was peeing... in a burger king cup... under her blanket. 

i held my panic back and thanked her and took a arm out from under the blanket and took the pillow. she smiled and went back. if she looked down, she defiantly would've noticed something was weird. 

after i was done, i felt beyond relieved and happy that i peed and didn't get caught. i put the lid back on the cup and the straw back in. i tucked it in my bag with my cleats, shin guards, and long socks. i didn't even bother zipping it up.

this is where the fu happens.

i went back to the back of the bus and said i couldn't sleep. i put my bag in my seat and went to join my friends.

the bus driver slams on the brakes, the cup of pee flies out of  my bag and spills everywhere. my heart stops. 

everybody laughs, thinking i just spilled my soda. the bus driver curses and my coach throws me a roll of paper towels from the front of the bus. my friend said she'll help and at this point i'm cursing her for her generosity.

i tell her it's fine but she's insisting she should help. there's nothing i could do except let her mop up my pee. she stops and sniffs the paper towel. 

""this smells funny. i thought you got dr pepper at burger king?"" she says. i shrug and pray that she let it go. 

then the rest of my team mates start sniffing the air too. i prayed that they didn't put two and two together. 

""did you get ice? this is warm"" my friend says since the pee was seeping through the paper towel and she felt the warmth. i thought it was pretty disgusting but i shrugged it off.

after we cleaned up, a boy yells ""holy shit she peed in the cup!"" and everyone turns to look at me. 

long story short, i quit my soccer team and now cry while eating nutella. fml

td;lr peed in a cup, pee spills everywhere, had to quit soccer out of humiliation.

i went on date to a restaurant that does what i believe to be the best pizza in london (homeslice if you're curious) and they gave us the leftovers in a paper bag. then we went to a cocktail bar, one of those ones that does novelty cocktails (the only kind i drink). so one of the drinks they set on fire, they fill half a passion fruit shell with alcohol and light it. normally they then sprinkle icing sugar over it, creating a big burst of flame but this time they didn't. so i thought i'd get it back to the table before it went out i did a good job too, manoeuvred through the crowd like a pro and just as i got back to the table i bumped my arm and spilt it.

i set the pizza on fire, a napkin, part of the table and my hand. i'd had a few already so there was a kind of delayed reaction as i looked it with a sort of, ""huh, look at that."" my date was a bit quicker and fanned out the flames. no real harm done, it was like a mild sunburn but i spent the rest of the night holding my hand against the ice in the glass.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i work in china, and my contract is coming to an end. in fact, it ended today. this is the middle-of-nowhere china, and car/bike rentals aren't a thing, and taking taxi's is problematic.
to get around, i asked friends to check for a second-hand motorcycle, but since they were unsuccessful, i bought a new one figuring i could sell it second hand myself when i would leave.

good plan, right?
i bought it, haggled, and used it for 8 months - then asked people to help me advertise that the 'laowai' was selling a barely used bike for only a bit over half of the new price.
there's no defects, it runs like a charm and in 8 months, all it's got on it is about 1300km. and it's yours for /cheap/.


i was pretty confident it would be easy to unload, and it didn't take long for there to be a few takers. eventually, a guy who is a friend of a co-worker of my girlfriend (whew) reaches out to us, says he's seen the bike at her work and would be happy to take it off our hands.


great. we reach an agreement, he does the typical chinese haggling thing (mandatory) and he and the gf agree to the price we had in mind all along in the first place (not that its a hard sell. really.)


i just asked him to wait until today, my last day here, to come pick it up - so i could continue to use it till i left the country.


now, he doesn't speak a word of english, and my chinese is /shit/ - so his daughter came along to help interpret. she apparently also didn't speak any english, but she did bring a phone with a translator app. whatever, a pretty straightforward deal, n'est pas?


now, what you need to know is - it's hot here right now. real hot.
and where i'm from, if you're selling a vehicle - you clean it up and get it shiny. so i get it all nice, shiny and clean and they arrive a bit later.
i get ready to hand over the keys and the paperwork, when he starts circling the bike and being super-critical of scratches on the rubber near the mirrors and so on. you know, minor things.


really not in the mood for another round of haggling (last time took about an hour) and even less on doing it through daughter's smartphone - i remind him he's already inspected it and agreed to a price. we go back and forth for about 10 minutes until he remarks ""well, it's not like you have any alternatives, you're leaving tomorrow. what are you going to do, leave it behind?"".


now, i just spent 40 minutes cleaning this thing and probably suffering sunburn for it. i'm selling it at a price i know is more than decent because honestly - i'm a nice guy and i hate this haggling process.
i'd also been having a bad couple of last days (high workload near the end, lots of 'the sky is falling when you're leaving' and 'not enough trained people' etc) so i'm not in the mood to put up with this.
i've been containing my mood so far, but getting more and more annoyed at dealing with this, still out under the scorching sun and finally ... i lose my temper. a truly, rare, occurrence. i grab the nearest heavy thing in reach, conveniently a hammer, and ram it down on the mirror that started the whole debate. hard enough to shatter the glass and bend the bar holding it upright at a downward angle, as well as the entire dashboard and wiring.


i look up and tell him that now, i'm willing to take the insulting price he's offering.


result? no sale - not a chance for recouping any expense - (rightly) angry girlfriend - feeling of satisfaction was a lot more temporary and replaced with some guilt and shame for letting my temper get the better of me.

input: Text: so, i am a maintenance guy in a factory. i am sitting here on reddit just browsing and all of a sudden, my stomach cramped up. so i walk out of the office and go out of the maintenance cage. we have a cage around our tools and supplies so other people cant get to them and steal them. no joke people have actually stole mops from us. anyways, it is a rule to close the cage when you exit. the cage to the door is self locking so i shut the cage and rush to the restroom. i am sitting on the toilet and look at my belt. at that point i realized i had fucked up. i left my keys in the office.... at this point i strain and get out all i can until i feel that my stomach is eased off enough where i can last a few hours. i walk to the edge of the cage and see the office. luckily i didn't shut the office door inside the tool crib and i can clearly see my shiny keys laying on the desk. i didn't want to look like a complete idiot so i didn't call a fellow tech to come open the gate for me. no that's just silly. looking around i see a metal bar. taking the metal bar i push it though the chain links and pull over a cart with tools on it. reaching in i grab an allan pack and get out a .05mm allan wrench. i reach down on my belt and pulled out my multi-tool. i praise god that i always carry this thing on me. pulling out the tension wrench on it, i inserted the allan wrench into the lock and my tension wrench in the bottom. here i am on one knee trying to hurry and get this open when low and behold, here comes a security guard. right as i turn my head, the lock turns and the cage comes open. he witnessed a breaking and entering. i stood up and looked at him and he looked back at me. there was a moment of silence between us two as we shared a moment of tension, a mexican standoff. he then comes up to me and grabs me by the back of the neck and pats me down. all while he gets on the radio calling for more security. all the time my face is up against the wall, i'm blabbering trying to explain myself. he then grabs my arm and here comes the backup. to make a long story short, i spent 2 hours explaining to them i work here and i had locked myself out. after i showed all the evidence they laughed at me and let me loose.

input: Text: this happened many years ago but it's always been one of my  favorite fuck ups (there have been so many). i had been living overseas and had come home for christmas. i was from a small rural town and for news years i was heading into the big city to meet up with some of my old university friends. i didn't have a car so my dad generously said i could take his small delivery van from work. it wasn't the coolest car in the world but it was transport - it was like a small station wagon car but with no rear passenger doors and just a flat space at the back. it was used for deliveries. i had promised my dad to have the car back by the next morning. so it was around 4am and i started the drive back home from the city - it was a 2 hour drive. about an hour into the drive i could feel my eyes getting really heavy and a couple of times i could feel myself drifting off. so i pulled the car off to the side of the road in a small side truck stop and thought it would be best i got a couple of hours sleep. and ideal for me, i was in a van so i had space to stretch out. i went around the back and climbed in, as there was a metal grill security divider between the back area and the front seats. i pulled the back door shut and tried to get comfortable, which turned out to be harder than i was expecting. after about an hour of fitful sleep, i decided to make another attempt at driving home. it was at that point that i realized my fuck up. the back door couldn't be opened from the inside. and there were no rear passenger doors or windows that could open. and there was a metal grill closing off the front seats. i was trapped. i had locked myself inside the car. i didn't have a mobile phone. and i was enough off the side of the road to make it hard for passers-by to see me. the first hour was spent feeling sorry for myself and just hoping a truck or another car would see me. no one did. the second hour i was starting to get panicky. it was summer time and the sun was now up and it was going to get really hot really fast. i had no water or anything. i felt like such an idiot. what a complete fuck up. i tried kicking the security divider but it didn't budge. i managed to locate some screws holding it in place - but i had no tools. my wallet was on the front dashboard and through some contortions, i managed somehow to get my arm through the divider to reach the wallet. now i had a credit card that i could try and use to remove the screws. this turned out to be much harder than i anticipated due to the location of the screws. it took me a couple of hours to remove about 8 screws. and that finally allowed the bars on the security grill to be removed enough for me to squeeze through. after being locked in the car for almost four hours, i finally got free. i was late getting home and returning the car to my dads work. i don't think anyone believed my excuse.

input: Text: okay i'll start by stating i am under aged 
(17) which means i can't buy any alcoholic drinks. with that being said, i absolutely love the sensation of being drunk.

i am always conscious whilst being drunk, and it never got me into trouble.
also, i have to notify that i've drank a lot of times before, whilst my mother doesn't suspect me of drinking anything besides a few beers at most.

now this happened at a new years party, you'd pay at the entrance and drink as much as you could.

on the way there a few friends of mine and i had a full vodka bottle, and thought to ourselves; ""why are we bringing the bottle to a drink as much as you can party?"" so the guy who had bought the bottle asked to put it in my backpack since i was the only one with a backpack.

one more important information you should know is, that we all live a few dozen minutes apart from each other.

now , being a bit tipsy already from drinking a few breezers & beers, i didn't ask any questions like, ""when will i give it back?"" and just put it in the backpack.

now, after the hectic party in which i have another fuck up...
i was drunk and high, and forgot about the bottle, just left the party and went home with no worries.

fast forward to the next morning, my mother wakes me up angry as a bull who was just being teased by a bull fighter, tells me to explain right now ""why in the hell do you have a vodka bottle in your school bacpack?!""

*sigh* i had to explain the entire thing which was kind of embarrassing, and had to explain that i actually drink a lot...

i was covering reception at a veterinary hospital today. at one point i was dealing with 6 impatient clients and a phone ringing off the hook by myself.

i was returning to the front desk, and i was in a rush because the amount of clients and calls were relentlessly growing.

this hospital has small walkways and many intersections. a tech, client, and pet passed through a doorway just in front of me.

i slowed down just enough to let them pass, then kept my brisk pace.

little did i know this client had two daughters following her, no older than 8.

i realized this just as i slammed into one of them right when she passed the corner.

i knocked her back a good 2-3 feet, crotch to face as i worked to stop my momentum and prevent her from falling down.

i got to formally apologize and try to save face later when they came to pay the bill. luckily, the mom was in the 1% of non-psycho pet owners and got a good laugh out of the situation.

the poor little girl who got a violent faceful of crotch however was visibly pissed and embarrassed.

input: Text: i wasn't sure what the right word was, but yeah, i almost injured a blind person. i just want to put this before hand, in this most nicest way, i'm sorry i take things for granted, now i understand how tough you guys are.

so i saw a blind man at my school. we have lots of stairs. lots. you'll get a sense just how many in the story. he was bumping around and i thought it was odd because most people have assistance at school. if they didn't, they seemed able to handle themselves (i'm not sure why) so the first thing i said was 'do you need help?' he said yes, so i helped him; i let him take my arm.

this was my first fuck up. it's not that i have anything against anyone, but i'm seeing a counselor about my aversion to being touched. (yeah, i got issues) but i thought, ""well, i already offered, to late to back out."" this was my first problem in guiding the man. right now, thinking back, i would subconsciously move away from him which just was one of the reason why he probably walked funny because i was half dragging him in a way.

when i offered my arm to him he stowed his stick. i guess he trusted me enough to not use it? he shouldn't have. because right after that, we hit stairs going up and i fucked up. i forgot to tell him there was stairs. he tripped. but he said 'that's okay'. when we reached the top we talked.

during the whole time i was trying hard not to fuck up again, so then i started looking out for stairs and telling him when there was stairs. i also tried mentioning, 'now we go right/left'. so while i was concentrating on the path, he was chatting with me. he had an accent so unfortunately my poor concentration got thrown off and then i started saying nonsense, such as asking if he was a student at school despite him just moments ago saying he was taking class x 101. as i eased into the conversation i forgot to mention stairs again, this time going down. i fucked up twice. the stair case had a flat bit for a bit and then went down again. too late, i forgot to mention that. anyways, by the third stumble his stick came out and i guess he didn't trust me anymore, which was understandable.

but, gladly, that was the last set of stairs and i left him at his destination. and that was that.

side note: i'm sorry if this 'tifu' made me sound like a jackass, i suppose i might have been, but you know what, this was an eye opener, (no pun intended) and now i realize the stuff i take for granted. so, in the nicest way possible, damn, how you keep up with concentrating on walking, accents someone else etc... is wonderful. koodos.

we get our gas, i hand her the $20 and we pull out and to the red light. there was a very young person, maybe 15 years old, wearing a proper set of turncoats and helmet right by us. my wife tells me, ""this junior firefighter has very nice eyes."" she then rolls her window down to say, ""here you go son"" to the young person.

i get a good look at the firefighter, and the eyes and face are just way too charming looking for me to think it is a young man versus a young woman. i then look at the jeans, which were skinny jeans, and then noticed the shoes, which were tom's and pink colored.

the young firefighter just smiled big, walked over with the boot, accepted the donation, and waved us off after the money was placed and the light turned green. removing my inner filter and speaking out loud, i said, ""are you sure that was a boy?""

my wife tried to explain that boys can look like that too when only 15. i started to pull away, but kept slow, and explained to my wife, ""the shoes and pants are a bit of a clue to her gender. you called her 'son', you realize, yeah?""

my wife verifying herself, looked at the young person's legs and feet, gasped a huge breath, covered her face, and then locked eyes with the young lady. ""did i really call her son?""

my wife made me go back home to be embarrassed by herself, and i had to do the errands all by myself, for 5 hours. she feels better this morning, until she finds out i posted this on reddit!

anyways, with my hands in my pants, i parted my ass cheeks with my thumb and middle finger, like an anal speculum, and for a second felt that everything was as dry as arizona. but then, as if the hoover dam itself broke open, i felt a hot and runny substance come shooting out my butthole into my open-palmed hand. i froze in place and immediately whispered fuck. i looked over to my partner wide eyed, and we locked glances. he nonchalantly asked if i had just shit myself, and i simply accepted defeat and said yes. 

he immediately started dying of laughter as i started waddling towards the bathroom with one hand down my pants, shit still in hand. once i made it, i shut the door, shat the remaining colon juices, jumped in the shower, and silently cried while contemplating my life in its current state.

input: Text: tifu by letting my girlfriend set my ball bag on fire and this is how it all went down. btw this literally happened 10 minutes ago.

so my girlfriend is in nursing school and she is currently studying for a big test this week and earlier informed me that she is reading about why the nut sack retracts into the body during cold weather and drops down when it is hot. i didn't think much about it and went on with taking my shower, but when i got out i thought i would be a great boyfriend and allow her to inspect my man sack for educational purposes ya know. so there i am standing in her room with one leg on the floor and the other hiked up on her bed like the captain morgan man. but closely inspecting it isn't quite enough, to really set the bar as the best boyfriend ever i decide to demonstrate the retraction and decent of the testicles. retraction was no problem as it is rather cold in her apartment, she is impressed and so i move on to phase two on my plan. i ask her to grab a nearby lighter (the long kind that you use to light the grill) and place the flame under my scrotum so that the heat can rise up and warm my man parts. as she does this her hand moves up a little and next thing i know i can hear the hairs crackling and feel the pain of my now flaming pubic hairs. i quickly extinguished the flame and inspected my sack for permanent damage. i think the boys are gonna make it, but lesson learned don't play with fire... especially not with your pants off.

gf and i were fooling around yesterday after we got high, and we were about to do it when she notices she is bleeding. w/e, i love my girl every day of the month. no big deal, right? so we do the business, and that's that. i go wash my junk with a washcloth, blood was a little thick and chunky, and all is fine and dandy. 

today, we go for round 2. goes just as well as the first time. so i clean mr.penis once again. i also brush my teeth, because during our session i reapplied some spit and maybe got some blood in my mouth. no big deal. just blood.

i wash my face and brush my teeth. i may have mixed up the clean and dirty washcloth, but it's no huge deal. just wash and clean up with a brand new one. so we get ready and talk about her period. she confides that she was supposed to have it a week ago, and last night she had super sharp stomach pains and assumed they were her period starting. she started bleeding only after she got sharp stomach pains. as of today, she is no longer bleeding.

we think about what it can be, and realize that it could have possibly been a miscarriage (she's horrible about taking her pills on time). i then also realized that i washed my face/put my fingers in my mouth with what could be our miscarriage. i seriously feel like i'm going to pass out. could still be her period, but is starting to seem less likely since she feels fine.

input: Text: this actually happened back in middle school, about 12 years ago, but the tifu on the front page reminded me of it.

so in art class we got an assignment to paint self portraits of ourselves. me being the rebellious angsty teen wanted to complete the project as assigned, but add a little pizzazz.

so instead of just doing a normal portrait, i decided to paint myself as a gangster holding some sweet gats. the idea was to be in a pose like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ccwncar.jpg) only with both guns pointing to the left of my body.


well my lack of art skills, and spatial skills resulted in me being only able to fit one gun on the painting. the one on the right of my body, pointing to the left... which did not appear to be in front of me.



me being a dumb teen didn't even realize this and turned it in. 


que a call to the counselors office later in the day where he began questioning if i was suicidal. i didn't know what he was talking about at first, but then he pulled the painting out.

there was a portrait of me, holding a gun up to my own head.

 

 i actually laughed out loud and explained the situation. he understood and it never got brought up again. glad that didn't happen today when i probably would get in trouble just for painting a gun.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: happened last night, of course.

i'm in town for a few days to visit family, and my sister got free mets tickets, so i went with my mom, step-dad, sister, and brother-in-law. we were seated in the outfield, right next to the visiting bullpen. not bad seats really, except that behind us, a group of college kids were very loud. one guy in particular had a super shrill voice and kept yelling ""gotti!"" which i gather is either an inside joke or just something i haven't seen on reddit yet. now, this normally wouldn't bother me, but i could tell that it was annoying my mom and sister. 

around the time that my mom suggested we move one row away to get away from them, the fifth inning ended and out came the t-shirt cannons. there's one right in front of our section launching t-shirts, and the ""gotti"" guy starts going fucking nuts, just howling and yelling. normally, i would assume that the people on the field can't hear specific people yelling in the stands, but they heard this banshee. and as they loaded up another shirt, i had a premonition: they are going to launch this shirt right at this guy, because he's so fucking loud -- and *i am going to intercept it*, becoming a hero to my family, who couldn't stand him, and whom i apparently feel like i need to impress.

and lo and behold, they aim the cannon and pop, the shirt goes flying into the air, higher and higher, but in an arc that's coming right back down toward us. i gear up. the guy behind me has his hands out over my head, so i swat them away, and my sister is doing the same. and of course, people around us are getting louder and louder, the excitement is mounting. the shirt is falling, i'm looking right at it thinking, ""fuck yes. here we go."" it comes directly at me and i grab at it with my raised right hand -- which it bounces off, and flies toward my left hand, which is holding a plastic cup of beer. 

i hadn't really thought about the fact that all of that height meant the shirt had accelerated quite a bit, and that it had to be densely packed to be in the cannon. but it hit my left hand like a brick and smash, beer cup fucking explodes everywhere, totally crushed, spraying in every direction. the t-shirt, meanwhile, goes flying off that hand into the bullpen. one of the players comes out and grabs it, and instead of throwing it back up, he just takes the rubber bands off, looks at it, and goes back into the little hut they have in there. wtf. 

meanwhile, i'm covered in beer, and everyone lets out a disappointed--not sympathetic--""awwww."" and that was it. i had failed to impress my family, lost on the sure satisfaction of boxing out the screamer, and was covered in a sticky ($9.50) beer. i carried that shame for 4 more innings, and the mets lost on a double play.

input: Text: technically it was not today but last friday, hope you forgive me there. also, forgive the bad english of a spanish speaker.

  so i´m a nervous guy,and this week, the money my parents gave me for college went away faster than usual, because i had to buy some groceries on my apartment that i didn´t account for. now, i dont have a debit card so i can't get money from my savings that easily. so naturally i don't tell anything to my parents about me running out of money and i try to solve the situation myself by asking my friend to lend me some money, which i end up missmanaging, and by friday morning i had only enough money to return to my apartment and thats it. as i was pretty much bankrupt and i had to attend to some classes saturday morning, i give up and end up asking my parents to send me money. at this point all that goes through my mind is how bankrupt i am and how likely it is that money wont come on time and i´ll find myself with nothing to eat on saturday morning, so i was not paying attention while i took the bus back home.

the bus drivers where i live are pretty much insane, and policemen apparently dont care about this, so it was perfectly logical for the bus driver to skip a red light and go down my street at a 100km/h instead of 40km/h. in this moment i realize i will miss my stop, and there are no set stops for the bus on my country, outside of the capital city, so i yell at the guy to stop, of course he can´t go from a hundred to 0 in the half second that it would take him to get to my street. the guy slows down to 30km/h by the moment he gets to my stop, and i for some reason thought i could be a badass and jump/run out of the bus whithout fall damage cause well, my mind was all over the place about money, so i jumped from a moving bus, at 30km/h and the inevitable happens, i wreck my ankle like a total dumbass, and end up on the floor with gravel on my mouth, in front of the now fully stopped bus with people checking on me from the windows. out of pure shame i stand up and signal them that i'm ok and walk all the way to my apartment (approx 200m plus straircases) i lay on my bed and try to forget the incident by browsing reddit.

fast forward 3 hours and my ankle already is the size of a melon (a small melon), and i can't bear the pain. luckily this is also the moment that my cousin (who was sent to give me the money my parents were sending me) gets to the apartment so i ask him to get me to the hospital. long story short, i had a sprain and my tibia and fibula are half a cm more separated than they were supposed to be, which earns me a cast, a $300 bill with my cousin, and a lot of explaining to do at college to all the proffesors i end up owing exams, and to my already pissed parents.

a little background, my friend, we'll call her m, has to go to las vegas for a work conference. she told me and a mutual friend/coworker that for some reason they booked her a hotel room with two beds and that it would be cool if someone could go with her. i had to decline at the time because of other plans. last week those plans got cancelled so i was freed up to go on the vegas trip. here's where the fuck up starts.

i asked her if she still wanted someone to come with her. she said that would be fun and that the rooms is paid for so all i would have to pay for is the ticket and food. i got her flight info so i could book the same flights. 

then i say ""i'm about to buy a ticket, you're sure you want me to come?"" she said yes. i buy my ticket and tell her i have booked a ticket for the same flight she's on.  then we had a brief conversation about how excited we are and that i've never been to las vegas.

today, our mutual friend is sick so i told her not to get me sick since i'm going to las vegas in less than two weeks with m. she thought i was joking because m hadn't said anything to her about it. i text m and ask if we're keeping it a secret. m said she didn't mention it because she thought i was joking about going. also she said i can't sleep in the second bed in her hotel room.

input: Text: just happened today, and now i feel like shit.

so i was in the back right seat of a sedan, with two of my friends in the car. we pull up to the house, and the driver was going to reverse into the garage.

so the garage is a two-car garage, with a concrete wall on the left side (when facing the garage door). my friend was backing up to park on the left side, which is where the wall is. 

at this point, genius me decides to pull a james bond jump-out-of-a-moving-car kind of thing. so, just as the car was backing into the garage, i open the door and jump out, feeling awesome. my driving friend freaked out and stopped the car. i close the door and tell him its ok, and he should keep backing up. so he does.

then, i come up with another genius idea. i had a bag in the back of my car, and i decided to get it while the car was reversing. so as the car slowly got in the garage, i quickly flick the lever, and the trunk door sprang open.

as you all know, if a trunk door opens on a sedan, the driver can't see. so my friend completely panicked and swerved the car left, right into the solid wall on the side. 

i guess i'll pay for the dent on the back of the car.

so about 1 yr ago i was sitting at a table with my family(including extended family so a lot of people talking loudly) and me being younger than most and also not drunk i was browsing reddit. i stumbled across the post where everyone upvoted so that when you google comcast a picture of a swastika came up. you guys know what i'm talking about. so when i read this i laughed hysterically, but my then 8-yo little sister was sitting next to me and saw the swastika that i laughed at. she asked me what it was and so naturally, i told her it was the international symbol for world peace. yeah. all was well until today, when my sister saw the nazi's on the news this morning(now 9 yo). upon seeing their signs and shit she was reminded of the ""international symbol for world peace"" and began to draw it. at school. yeah. so my parents got a call, had a nice little chat with my sister(who was in trouble at school for telling more children that a swastika is the ""international symbol for world peace"" leading to more innocent kids drawing swastikas), and apparently for the past year she has thought that a swastika means peace. my parents asked where she got the idea and she told them. i am posting this in bed, grounded, after accidentally(and indirectly) teaching a 3rd grade class that drawing swastikas is a good thing.

 

edit: just to clarify i am not a nazi

edit 2: wow thx for all the up votes and comments! didn't expect it to blow up like this! to everyone that mentioned the origin of the swastika i tried bringing that to my parents and they didn't buy it... they think i intended to teach it to her as a nazi symbol. still grounded.

input: Text: background:
i am a freshman boy in high school and have history second period. this happened on the second day of school.

so, as always on the first few days of school, my history teacher didn't have much to discuss other then the course outline and classroom rules etc. so, after the basics were covered, we moved on to a discussion about isis and what the proper course of action is. this boy, let's call him joe, had an intricate part in the discussion.

my friend, let's call him marcus, and i had noticed that joe seemed like an excessively spoiled and immature kid. he yelled out at the teacher during lessons, and didn't seem to understand the basics of social interactions. in fact, it had only been a few hours with the kid, and the entire class seemed to hate him. during our isis discussion, he proposed that the us send in a significant amount of troops and nukes. marcus, i, and the rest of the class, including the teacher noted the absolutely preposterous nature of this idea, but nobody spoke up against the idea. however, marcus and i saw this as an opportunity to get revenge on joe for being a complete dick. thus, we ""protested"" his idea and ""excommunicated"" him from the group. we did so in an manner that made in abundantly clear that we were joking. however, joe, upon hearing our argument, started to sob and bawl endlessly. 

marcus, being a well behaved kid, was freaking out. he was convinced we would be suspended, and that his history grade was doomed. luckily, our teacher was cool about it, and just made sure we didn't have any wrong intentions. we later cleared up the issue with joe, but to this day i'm still convinced he a spoiled bitch.

input: Text: this actually happened a couple days ago. 

so it was just a regular ol' day and i was outside skateboarding with a friend. i was practicing some trick that i don't even remember, and i was explaining to my friend that it was quite dangerous. the next thing that happened, (quite ironically i might add) was i jumped, and the board went vertical to the ground, and as i came down my legs landed on both sides of the skateboard. needless to say, i sat down for a bit. after a few minutes i went inside to assess the damage, and almost passed out. there was blood all over the inside of my legs, and a large gash in my ballsack. i yelled for my father, stating ""i may have to go to the hospital."" 

after we got there and the doctors had taken a look, they decided all it needed was a few stitches! so i lay there, holding my balls as the doctor sewed them up, wincing as the needle went in and out of my balls. 

word of advice, maybe it isn't such a bad idea to wear a cup skateboarding.

input: Text: so, this was this morning. i look at my weather forecast regularly as my job is very dependent on the weather. i knew it was supposed to be beautiful for the next couple of days prior to going to bed.

i woke up this morning to the sound of rain. my first thought was, *wow, i thought it was supposed to be nice for a couple of days.* that quickly changed to *i must be dreaming...i know it was supposed to be really nice for the next few days.*

soon thereafter, my son woke me up and said ""daddy, it's flooding"". i said, ""you just had a bad dream, bud, go get some sleep."" i thought this was part of my dream at this point, and didnt put two and two together until he retreated to his room. as he walked back i heard sloshing water and i snapped awake. 

water, everywhere. from my washing machine, into the hallway, down to the living room, into my bedroom, and into my son's bedroom. i went into my laundry room and could hear the ""rain"" sound i heard earlier. 

a $10 hose had sprung a leak. i shut off the water, grabbed every towel, fan, and hairdryer in my house and went to work. 

the carpet in my house is currently pulled back, with fans and hairdryers trying to blow the carpet and padding dry. it's been 12 hours and its just starting to dry up fairly well. at this point i don't know if it's recoverable, or if i'm going to have to drop a couple thousand dollars to replace my carpet.

input: Text: ok so i was working at a spa a few years back. this is a spa which has many different private tub rooms some more luxurious than others. our top of the line private tub had a sauna, private deck overlooking the mountains, private sitting agrees two private bathrooms, the works. 
this gentleman booked this tub about a year in advance so he could propose to his girlfriend who always wanted to visit the area. at the time we offered a special package that consisted of roses, chocolate covered strawberries, champagne, special glasses, you get the idea. 
the time came where everything was set into motion, the room was set up, everything was set and ready to go. the couple had also booked a private massage as part of the package. 
normally the guests will have the private tub first followed by the massage, nine times out of ten this happens. for whatever reason, this couples order was reversed so they had their massage first followed by the tub. 
i had been on vacation the week before and the day i got back i was relieving the spa host, whose job it was to get the guests matched up with the therapist.  she must have been in a hurry to leave because she told me only what i needed to know about the guests that were sitting there but not much more, which wasn't out of the ordinary.  
so i'm getting the station ready for my shift and i glance at the log book. i find out about the couple and kind of register it in the back of my mind.
so a couple hours later they check in with me, i recognize the name. i introduce myself and tell the woman
""congratulations on your engagement! have you set a date?""
the lady gives me a puzzled look and the guy is glaring at me. he hadn't proposed yet and i ruined the surprise. although they understood it was an accident and weren't mad i was so distraught i had to go home.

how you may ask? well i'm poor and in college, so i have basic cable, and i'm limited to watching the only 2 games each week that are shown on tv. i still enjoy watching whichever teams are playing, but quality is limited and i obviously can't switch between all the nfl games. 

i take care of all tech issues for my dad, and today he asked me to call directtv to find out why we were charged extra for this month. i call and get a technician on the phone. i'll skip the boring conversation until it goes something like this: 

me: ""we were supposed to be locked into a promotion when we signed on.. can you explain how much were supposed to be paying and what we're being charged for?""

tech: ""sure! $47/mo for tv, $6 for a receiver... discounts... nfl sunday ticket included, free rec""

me: ""wait hold the fuck up for 1 sec, did you just say we have nfl sunday ticket?""

tech: ""yes, it's part of the promotion.""

me: ""hold on i don't believe you.""

tech: ""ok.""

me: *proceeds to log into online directv account""

and there it was reddit. a big beautiful stream nfl football now button. i clicked it and low and behold the orgasmic wonderfulness of what is on demand football streaming is available at my fingertips. no more online streaming, no more shit cable, i have nfl sunday on directv.

for the last 10 weeks i've been fucking up by either limiting myself to basic cable (fuck you cox) or giving my beautiful computer the dirtiest of std malware by going in unprotected to online streaming sites.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: today i was on my way to a session with a sub of mine, and the following happened:

i'm visually impaired and can't drive, so i'm stuck taking the bus.  there was half an hour before my bus came, and i was kind of hungry, so i decided to make a trip to the local grocery store.  i just wanted a sandwich, so i didn't bother with a cart going in.

well, i ended up buying more than i anticipated; some of my favorite desserts were on sale, and because i didn't get a cart, i put them in my bag with my toys.

i went to check out, and because i still made it under the '15 items or less' limit, i used that stand.  without conveyor belts.

so i go up, we exchange pleasantries, and i unpack my own stuff.

>cashier: oh, you brought your own bag?  i'll give you your bag credit, then.

>me: er, bag credit?

>c: yeah, it's our new program.  you get ten cents off your total for each of your own bags you bring in.  which brings your total to [total].

i turn my attention to the pay pad, swiping my card, entering my pin, etc.  

and it didn't really register in my mind until just as it was happening: the cashier was reaching for my bag to put my groceries in.  

now, my toys were clean.  they didn't smell, they didn't have any cum or anything on them, but put yourself in the position of this poor woman: you're just trying to get through your day (given the time it was, she had either just started or was just about to leave), and you have a seemingly 'normal' customer with a bag of bdsm toys.

>cashier: oh.  um.  do you want me to bag your groceries for you?

>me: *ohgodohgodohgodohgod* um...no...i've got it...*frantic rush to pay, take my receipt, and get the hell out*

i take my stuff, sit down to check my email to make sure my sub was still meeting me, and who comes by but the manager of the store.

>manager: um, sir?  can you maybe close your bag so it's not open for the entire public to see?

in my rush to sit down in the cafe, i didn't realize that my bag was in the middle of the isle, open for any passerby who happened to look down to see.  i sheepishly reach down, tie the bag shut (it was one of those reusable bags; it didn't have any sort of clasp), and get back to my email.

not only is my sub not meeting me, i'm now known as 'the creep that carries sex toys everywhere' at my favorite grocery store.  i just wanted a sandwich, god damn it.

 

**edit**: oh god now they're disinfecting the whole area where i was sitting...that's just unnecessary

input: Text: finally, today i fucked up!

this happened a week ago. 
i had this strong urge to shit on my way home one day. i rushed into the toilet and my ass turned into a fucking gatling gun. after depleting my ammo, i got a little carried away with wiping, causing anal injury. it really hurt, but i quickly forgot about it.

then i went out with my friends to grab something to eat.
we went to this turkish restaurant and ordered some kebab. 
it had those spicy fucking peppers which were probably marinated in lucifer's boiling piss,
and i happily ate them along with my meal, completely forgetting about my hurt ass. those peppers were really hot.

i only remembered about it when i was on the toilet seat in my home.
there was no going back, and i let it go. 

can't hold it back anymore. 

i didn't feel the pain immediately, but when i did, it was horrendous. imagine being impaled by one of the crossbow bolts gordon freeman used in half-life. it can also be described as getting a rimjob from satan himself.  

i started to bleed from the ass, and the blood was purple. i don't even know why, but i didn't give a shit.
feeling the boiling shit seeping through the wounds in my poor, poor asshole was dreadful. i thought that washing it would stop the pain, but it was even worse.

this is the kind of thing you'd only wish for your worst enemy.

input: Text: so this was weird. happened about 20 minutes ago. 

was driving home from getting some maccas when i saw a cop car at a set of lights. i was going the opposite way to them. they hooked it around the corner and followed me around a corner so i pulled over to the side of the road, expecting them to follow me and pull up behind me. i have a pretty loud exhaust and a really loud sound system (which was turned up because fuck it why not) so i was expecting something to do with that. 

instead, they drive in front of me, pull over, and wait there for about five minutes. so i'm sitting behind this cop car not knowing if they're going to get out and talk to me or not. no lights either. 

they start pulling forward again so i decide to take off too. however, they pull on to the road and start driving really slowly in front of me. i'm driving really slowly behind them and i can't overtake them because they're cops. 

anyway, they pull back off the road again so i pull up next to them and wind my window down and ask if they wanted me to pull over. the driver just stares dead ahead. i drive in front of them and start heading home, with them right behind me. we're both doing about 10kph at this point. 

i get to my house and turn into my drive way. the cops just pull over out the front and watch me get out of my car then slowly drive away. 

i have no idea what the hell they were doing or why they didn't say anything when i asked them.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: didn't happen today, but 8 years ago. almost exactly 8 years ago, actually.  

it was the beginning of my freshman year of high school, and there was a certain video that was making the rounds on the internet. everyone at my lunch table was talking about it. in fact everyone who was anyone was talking about it. looking back, it seems a little weird how popular this video was. i felt like everyone had something to say about it.

""this video is so sick man, i almost threw up."" 
""try to make it through the whole thing, i dare you."" 
""no way, richard. it's not ice cream. you can see it coming straight out of her ass!""

i am talking, of course, about 2 girls 1 cup. i had never seen it, but after hearing about it all day long at school, i was definitely intrigued. i decided that i would watch it right after getting home from the bus when it would be just me at home. 

i took a seat at the computer, typed in that simple web address, and finally saw for myself what everyone was talking about it. i almost made it to the end when i heard my little sister come in the front door after getting dropped off from school. i quickly exited from the site and went upstairs to my room like nothing had ever happened. looking back, i distinctly remember not feeling the need to clear the history. for one, i was always paranoid that my parents would know what i was up to if the web history was ever empty. second, the title of the site was just 2girls1cup or something along those lines, and i didn't think it would catch their attention for being very porn-like. 

about an hour goes by, and after playing some xbox i decided i wanted a little snack. as i took my first steps down the stairs, i began to hear a familiar tune...(if you've seen the video you know what i'm talking about)

""that song...it can't be the same song...holy shit, it's that song!"" 

i sprinted down the stairs and into the living room to realize that my absolute worst fear had come true: there sat my 4 year old sister, eating pretzels and watching brazilian scat porn. i rushed over and slammed the laptop shut, but she just kept looking forward like she was in some sort of trance.

she then turned her head and told me with the straightest face, ""they were eating each others poop. and then she threw up in her mouth and ate it. why were they doing that?"" needless to say, i was mortified. 

i tried convincing her that it was just ice cream, but to no avail---she knew what she had seen. i spent of the rest of the day in sheer terror, as i thought for sure that she would tell my parents all about what she saw on the computer, and that inevitably it would lead to me getting questioned. to my surprise, i never heard anything from them. to this day i wonder if she still remembers accidentally watching that video.

a few days later i realized how it happened. my little sister could barely read at this point, but she could recognize words, specifically the title of her favorite website for computer games, which was something along the lines of ""games for girls"". she knew how to navigate to the web history, and she would just scroll until she saw the word ""girls"" and click on it. well, this time the first site with the word ""girls"" in it wasn't a game site.

input: Text: as a kid at 12, i took a trip to canada, where my auntie lived. she had the greatest idea to put me in this summer camp her kids went to, to show me the canadian outdoor life. 

little did i know, it was more of a place to keep kids busy, so naturally i was bored. one of the activities was washing dishes for more younger kids who had meal time before us. so there were older kids working the kitchen, and one in particular was this red head girl. 

she seemed nice and we talked, and at one point i told her to come over as i washing dishes. i thought it would be a funny idea to dry my hands on her shirt. so i told her to come, and i took my sloppy wet arms out and patted the back of my hand on her shirt, than flipped them over to dry my palms. i didn't realize at that moment that i was drying at the chest area, since to me, all i felt or even thought about was the shirt.. it just so happened she was the same height as i was, and so naturally my hands extended right there.

i thought it was okay to joke around like that at the time because we seemed cool and i thought she would get a laugh from it or even do it back. she looked at me with a shocked face, and casually just walked out. i didn't think anything of it, because i thought she was just reacting to the water on her shirt. 

i go outside later, and as i walked by a cabin, i hear through a window a girl crying and talking to one of the camp leaders. i didn't think anything of it either, so i walked by looking for something fun to do. as i went back around, this time the opposite side of the cabin, i saw the red head girl in there with one of the camp leaders, and i thought me and her were still friendly after my stunt, so i waved and said ""hello!"" 

the camp leader looked at me like i was the spawn of satan and yelled ""get out of here, what are you doing here"". i left clueless as to why he responded that way, or why she had her face down not looking at me. 

i get called by their whole canadian counsel of camp leaders later and all of them were talking to me. ""do you know what you did? is this what they teach you in america?"" i literally had no idea what they talked about, they didn't even tell me what i did wrong.they gave me a whole speech that i didn't understand, i wasn't the brightest kid. i just understood not to go near her. my auntie had to pick me up, but left my cousin (her kid) there who still wanted to stay. i probably ruined it for her, because they thought she was related to satan. 

i realized years later on my own, that what i did was sexual harassment. i think i learned what it was from south park (the sexual harassment panda episode). i told my aunt my side of the story, as a grown man now, when she finally came to visit the states, and she got a huge laugh from it. she said they thought i was crazy and a troubled boy. 

i just find it odd that the girl never said anything at that moment to me, when i was dumb kid, or even as to why she cried or felt hurt by a pat. i probably traumatized her perception of americans, or from ever going back to that summer camp.. all from a misunderstanding, ifu.

so a few years ago as i was browsing the internet, i felt a little bit peckish. i decided to grab a cheeseburger that was out in the kitchen and proceeded to snack on that for the night. it was pretty damn tasty. i finished half of the burger and left it on my desk before going to bed.

i woke up at like 3 am, and started getting a case of the morning munchies. i thought ""hey! i still have that burger on my desk."" in the darkness of my room, i starting patting my desk down until i hit fast food gold. bun was a bit stale, but it was fine. i took a bite out of it. strangely bitter and crunchy, as if someone laced my burger with really shitty sour pop rocks. still chewing, burger in hand, i turned on my room lights to see if there was anything wrong with the burger.

ants. a ridiculous amount of ants swarmed my burger, and then i realized a ridiculous amount of ants were alive, dying, or dead in my mouth, and the bitterness was from the acid in their bodies. holy fucking shit. i almost gagged in my room from the thought. i ran to the bathroom with ant laden burger meat still in my mouth and spat the insect, acid, and minced cow orgy glob into the toilet, and quickly rinsed my mouth with as much water as i could. after lots of swishing and gargling and spitting, i was sure at least 99% of them exited my mouth. i brushed my teeth for good measure. a few legs and antennae were probably still in there, though. that night i couldn't sleep, and the day afterward i had a loss of appetite.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: disclaimer: i am not trying to claim that what i did was morally right and it was probably quite disgusting, but i just want to share what happened for your entertainment. also i'm not a writer so sorry if the narration is poor.

so i'm in my last year at school, doing latin (i don't know why) as one of my a levels (exams). but at the end of last year our school's main latin teacher retired and in his place stepped in an attractive blonde girl.

every morning she asks someone to fill up her flask with coffee from the nearby shop, just before the lesson begins and i usually do it since i like to get some occasionally myself and i get in earlier than everyone else.

so one day i'm feeling horny as fuck on my way back from the shop when a dark thought enters my mind. so i go into the toilet right next to our classroom and do the unthinkable. i wank (jack off) into her coffee. i'm not quite sure why - i guess there was thinking sexually arousing about knowing that she was essentially drinking my cum unwittingly.

she didn't seem to notice at all so naturally i did the same thing the next day. and the next. and the following days until about two days ago. i had become bored of this operation, it had lost its initial excitement factor. i knew i wouldn't be caught so i was no longer interested. 

now in hindsight the thing i did next was just stupid. plain stupid. now my teacher is really hot, but she has a spot above her chin which she constantly complains about, saying she can't get rid of it. so i go home, wank into a small, unlabelled pot and give it to her, saying its a brand new spot removal cream which hasn't been made available to the public yet - this was somewhat believable as my mom does research in cosmetic science.

she thanks me and immediately puts it on. i didn't expect her to do that, i thought that she would have waited until she got home. now the following is the exact dialogue that we had.
""it's a bit sticky isn't it?""
""i don't know i haven't tried it myself""
""i can barely get it off my fingers""
""i think it's good for your skin in general, so you can just rub it in""
(massages her face with my cum)
""you know what this reminds me of?""
""no, what?""

and then began the longest moment of silence i have ever experienced. my armpits were sweating badly, my vision was going dark and blurry - like when you get up too fast, and my stomach kind of clenched really suddenly. she was staring right at me with a look of contempt that bore a hole in my soul.

""erm ... i'm not sure. i just completely forgot what i was going to say""
she knew and i knew she knew and she knew i knew she knew. i'm guessing she's taken facials before and even if she hadn't she'd still know what cum feels like.

""ok, well i could only get that one pot so i don't know if i'll be able to give you any more""
""that's ok, i don't think i'll need it. anyway, the bell's gone so sit down and let's start.""

yesterday she didn't show up to our lesson. we were given a cover teacher but there was no explanation. i don't know if she's still working here anymore.

input: Text: i've been wanting to wash my car for a while now but i work full time and only have off on the weekends. so today i decided to wash my car. then after i was done i was standing on the walk in front of my house rinsing out my sponge. the walk was getting a bit hot so i thought, i'll just step into my nice cool, soft lawn. i have no idea what i stepped on but it hurt like a motherfucker, and i proceeded to announce it to the whole neighborhood.  


i just figured i stepped on a sharp rock because i have a gravel driveway. after a few moments it stopped hurting so i didn't think any of and proceeded to walk around in my muddy gravel driveway. it wasn't until a couple hours ago when it started to hurt, but i figured it may just be my sock sitting funny in my boot. took my boot off and found out there is a giant hole in my foot.  


this reminds me of something that happened when i was around 6, and my father was building a big shed in the back yard. i was helping him tear down the old shed and i saw him stepping on the head of a nail to push it into the wood the rest of the way. i wanted to help and do this too, so i found a piece of wood with a nail sticking out and stepped on the fucker. forgot the most important part though, and stepped on the pointy part of the nail like a dumbass. it went straight through the sneaker and into my foot.

input: Text: this actually happened today and it is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. today i had a doctor's appointment. the receptionist for his office is one of the hottest girls i have ever seen. due to a medical issue i've been having and because of my family history my doctor requested a stool sample. i had to give it right away because he needed a “fresh” one. it took me a while to “go” and i was trying to rush because my car is in the shop and i had a bus to catch and didn’t want to have to stand around and wait the half an hour for another bus. i finally got the sample taken care of and i was rushing back to the lab to drop it off because the bus was due to come any minute. the jar was wrapped in a plastic bag and i was rushing down a hallway and i turned a corner and literally bumped into the hot receptionist. what happened next was my worst nightmare. i guess in my rush i didn’t completely screw on the jar lid completely tight. the lid came flying off and some of my “sample” ended up all over her. on her clothes, on her face and even in her hair. i couldn’t even react to how embarrassed i was. she looked horrified like she wanted to puke and i was so horrified i didn’t even help her up i just grabbed the jar, ran to the lab and dropped it off and high tailed it out of that building. i want to die now and i am never going back to that doctor or even leaving my house again.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened a couple hours ago, and could be summed up briefly by a couple hand motions and a joke about bananas, but what's a disaster without some back story?

i had long been interested in 3d printers as both a project and a tool for some time, but the cost of entry into the hobby had always been too prohibitive. lately the cost of many kit builds has dropped into the same price range as an average desktop printer. it was time to jump in.
i ordered a kit of amazon.com, it took weeks to come in, but it finally arrived. i took an afternoon to set up the new toy; then began a comedy of errors trying to put this thing together.
to be honest the setup was a breeze, even with the horrible instructions that were packaged with my model. but one after another parts turned out broken, or clogged, or shoddy. i had the control board replaced after two weeks emailing support. i had to replace my usb cable. (who knew?). i trouble shot, tested and calibrated for days.
eventually things are ready for a test print. set it up, load a model, click ""go"". the thing moves, but nothing comes out. clogged!
i spend the next few hours unclogging the hot end and extruder, only to snap it in half when i was putting the thing back together.
so i order a new one, the v6 lite from e3d. i figure, this is it, once i get this nice new piece, trouble will be over and playtime will begin!
nope.
i waited another week for the new hot end to come in. it showed up today! oh joy. 
i set about putting this thing together; a new engine to feed my machine. i manage to assemble it in short order, only to somehow pull the solid wire straight out of the actual thermistor in the end. bollocks!
breathe deep; this isn't a problem. i take apart whats left of my original shoddy broken hot end, manage to salvage the thermistor from the wreckage and use it to fully assemble the new one. great!
but how do i attach it? looks like i need some 3d printed parts to fit my new parts to my 3d printer. this can work, it has to.
so i go about getting parts printed to mount the new hot end, but its another waiting process.
as inigo would say, ""i hate waiting.""
at this point, lets sidebar:
i live in a small room on the basement level. most of my life is fit in a 12 x 8 space. so, most anything i build (and i like to build), i end up building on the bed, on my lap. 
ok, back to the story.
so now i have time to waste. i'm sitting here staring at this almost working piece of machinery. i realize that with my spare time i could be taking the frankenstein wiring and making it pretty. so i do. 
i spend an hour, maybe two, dismantling each set of wires, braiding them, and putting them back together, pretty and perfect. i do this for pairs, sets of three, even sets of four. 
i'm in the final stages of reassembly, and i need to rotate the printer just enough to get my hand underneath to plug in the last wire. so i flip it up (still on my lap.), slowly guiding the wire by feel to its final home, when suddenly. snap! my frame cracks. it cracks in not one, but two places. unglueable places!
so now i've been setting at this task for a month, maybe two, off and on, and i have essential destroyed the entire thing for the sake of making it pretty!
moral of the story is, i'm probably a gorilla, and cannot be trusted with things that require finesse and fine motor skills. call me amy, and give me a complicated prosthesis so that i may speak to you via sign language and a computer.
eventually i will have to get a new frame, but for today, i will sit here, sip on the champagne of beers and contemplate setting what is left of the project on fire.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: a few years ago my family needed to replace the waterproofing for the floor of the shower on our second story. it is right above my bed and i had seen the ceiling had a couple of water stains from it leaking.
the plumber tore up the tiles, and the waterproofing, replaced what needed replacing, and then left. after a few hours we realised we hadn't seen our cat for a bit, but we thought maybe she was just prowling the neighbourhood. 

when it was dark we started worrying because she is rarely gone for this long. then just by chance everyone was quiet and we heard a mew. we called out for the cat and looked around but we couldnt find her (she and our other cat sometimes got stuck on the roof...). then we realised her meowing was louder inside the house. she wasn't in any wardrobes or cupboards (cats hide fucking everywhere). we realised she was stuck in the space between the floor of the second story and the ceiling of the first. 

we started freaking out and trying to find a way to free her. there was a ceiling fan downstairs almost in line with the upstairs bathroom so we pulled it out but of course there are nice thick crossbeams, and she just had to be on the other side of the closest one. my dad was tossing up whether he should break a hole in the ceiling to get her. he decides we shouldn't do anything until the morning, considering it's midnight and we're all tired and will probably make things worse, so he tries to sleep and says he'll call the plumber asap when he wakes up, but my mum is still freaking out. she is the kind of person that gets a bit upset when a cartoon animal gets hurt.... just imagine her with a real animal....
i look on the computer and show her how cats are strong independent animals who don't need no man and that stupid ceiling-cat will be fine until morning. mum's still not convinced until i remind her how cats, big and small, can go for days or maybe even weeks without drinking or eating. my mum relaxes a bit and tries to sleep too.

we call the plumber in the morning but he can't come until 5pm or later, and we say fuck it because his work will be ruined anyway, so we tear up the waterproofing ourselves.

the plumber gets back and redoes his work with the door closed in case the other cat is stupid enough to do the same thing. he said ""[he] saw a flash of white but assumed the cat would get scared of the loud noises [he] was making and run back out""

and the kicker, this was all the night before my sister's final high school exams so she was freaking out and couldnt sleep either...

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: my roommate and i have had a couple incidents with the upstairs neighbor. we've been contacted by our landlord multiple times explaining how our upstairs neighbor is not happy with our noise. (specifically my roommate playing the piano). i thought it would be hilarious to get a friend to put an eviction sign on my door for april fools. 

the plan is in motion. i decide to go play soccer while he is home. friend comes, drops off the notice, knocks on door, and runs. i come back around two hours later to find him on my computer looking for lawyers. it took everything not to start laughing. i went along with it for at least 30 minutes. i started blaming him for the piano noises. he got flustered, so i decided to reveal that it was a prank. 

once i say it's a prank he takes it pretty well. no draw backs. all in all great prank. he thought it was hilarious and original. never expected a thing since we've had issues with this. 10/10

the next morning we wake up to our landlord calling me at 8:30am. apparently he emailed the landlord right away saying it's bullshit that we we're getting evicted, and forgot about it in the 2 hours of rage and laughter. our landlord not knowing i did the prank pretty much told us the eviction was valid and told us to get the fuck out our place.

for the next 20 minutes i had the most awkward conversation trying to explain to this chinese lady that the eviction was a joke.

input: Text: as with many tifus, this did not happen today. 

while arriving to a music venue before one of my band's gigs, i noticed my car was overheating. being an irresponsible person that already had a few drinks on the way to the show (first fuck up), i decided i would open the radiator cap before allowing the car to completely cool off (second fuck up). i understood the dangers involved but decided i would be fine if i used a rag and slowly let the steam out before removing the cap. i had it under control for a minute before the cap shot out of my hand and coolant sprayed me in the face and soaked the right arm of my sweatshirt. i quickly washed my face off with puddle water and then realized my sweatshirt was stuck to my right arm, burning it badly. i removed my sweatshirt and rinsed my right arm off but it was too late. i would find out shortly after that about 60% of my right arm suffered 2nd degree burns. 

in a ridiculous amount of pain, i ran to a cvs down the street to purchase some burn cream, gauze, tape and whatever first aid products i thought i would need. this is when i learned that there are like 1000 different types of burn cream, all with specific applications. i was in too much pain to focus and grabbed supplies as quickly as i could. 

when i got to the cash register, the employee initiated small talk, asking how i was. i throw the cream on the counter and exclaim ""worst burn of my life"". keep in mind, at this point, there were no signs of a burn other than the look of pain on my face. my arm wasn't showing any indication of a burn yet, other than a little redness that was hidden by my tattoos.

it wasn't until i went outside and gave the supplies to a helping friend that i was informed i purchased hemorrhoid cream while telling the girl at the register that i had the worst burn of my life.

i was on a class trip to a ski hill (yeah, a few winters ago) and i had never gone skiing before. but being the dummy that i am, i decided that i was ready to try a ""real hill"" rather than the small hills for learning.

i was going pretty well until part-way down where there was a turn: left was the easier hill, right was a slightly more difficult hill, and straight ahead was a huge-ass tree. i had already seen one of my classmates go down the right hill and another go down to the left, and i wasn't sure which way to go... so of course, that translated into going straight, face-first into a tree.

cracked-open bloody lip, bruised tail-bone and lungs void of air, i sat there stunned when my teacher (at the back of the group) came across me and helped me down the hill. my lip was swollen for a week.

needless to say i haven't been skiing again...

input: Text: today, i got home and decided that i wanted to get some tacos.  fortunately, i live near a local taco chain (only about a mile), so i hopped on my bike and decided to ride there.  it was about 20 degrees, so i put on a warm jacket, but was unable to find any gloves.  

it's mostly downhill on the way there, so i cruised down without difficulty.  i ordered a shit ton of things, and the place had one of those 125 flavor pop machines, so i filled up my large cup with peach mellow-yellow (my all time favorite).  i ate most of the things, put two tacos in my jacket pockets for later, and refilled my cup before going out the door.  

i noticed that my gears were stuck on the lowest setting.  my fingers were too numb to fix it there, so i just settled for riding back in the lowest gear.  i jammed the cup into the holder on my bike, and pedaled off.  i finally made it up a small hill, ready to enjoy the cruise down it.  once there was almost no incline, i started to pedal.  unfortunately, i forgot i was in the lowest gear, and put most of my weight on it.  i ended up throwing myself onto the handlebars, and i, inevitably crashed.  my hands scraped against the concrete, but i fortunately was able to keep my face from hitting the ground.
  
i had bloodied up my hands pretty good, and my chain had fallen off of my bike.  after pacing around my bike for a solid minute mumbling expletives, i realized that my scraped up, almost completely numb hands would be unable to put the chain back on.  after a brief moment of silence for my spilled drink all over the street, i began the walk of shame back to my residence.

(possibly the most awkward laugh i've ever heard in my entire life). i didn't really know what to say so i just said ""i don't really know i just got confused"" then we both had an awkward laugh together. after that me and my gf went sledding and it was fun and then we ended up watching the movie then her and her mom took me home. when i got home i told her about how embarrassing it was and her reply was ""oh yah my mom told me about that. she said he apparently was just gonna drop his pants"". luckily after that she said she laughed and that she was understanding.

input: Text: so, around 2012, we just moved into a new house. we had absolutely no internet at that time, but my mom was a saint, she had the magical power of her cell phone, which had internet! every monday night, she would let us use her phone to look up random shit. i had tons of awesome memories with her phone, like the reveal of the new mario kart and super mario game coming next year. it was great...

but, onto the real story. it was another monday night, my mom gave us both the phone with unhindered internet access. now, i watch youtube videos all the time, it was how i found news about the latest in tech and stuff! as i was searching through the vids, going from link to link, i found this strange video. it's name? ""ytp: spongebob starts a farting contest in class"". what is this beast that lives on my screen? i found out quickly. it was vulgar, it was poorly edited, but most of all, it was hilarious. i tapped on the youtuber's icon, and i looked at all of his ytps, which were also hilarious.

i do this until around 11 p.m., and my mom bursts into the room to tell be something while i was watching a ytp. i quickly turn the phone off and nervously asked if it was time for bed, but before mom answered, she grabbed the phone out of my hands and watched the entire fucking ytp. she gets pissed, and sends me to bed. you might think i just got yelled at, but no. what my mom was going to tell me was that i could go out into the living room and have a midnight snack of a cupcake. a cupcake. let's just say, my pillow was drenched in tears when i finally fell asleep. i'm now 16 years old, and i've found ways to watch ytp in secrecy now.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: unlike most posts on this subreddit, this happened yesterday and today. anyways, i was dating this girl i liked for about a month and a half. she took relationships slow, which i respected because it was also my first relationship. we went on dates about every month and i thought we were both happy, and that eventually the smoochpocolapse would be happening soon. (never beyond this though, she was a prodistant and said she didn't want any sexual type of things to happen until marriage, which i also respected.) so yesterday i'm texting her saying that she's beautiful and amazing, trying to speed up the relationship in some way because it was too slow. i'm texting her and texting her and she says she wants to talk to me and lunch on thursday at school. also, this was no 1 week occasion as mentioned before. lunch rolls around and she said she wasn't that happy, and wanted to mutually end the relationship. i said that's ok, just as long as we were still friends. so i sit down across from her and i notice she was being a little flirtatious with one of her other friends, i.e. playing footsie and sitting uncomfortably close to each other. i thought it was nothing. later i was disgusted that she did all of that not even 6 minutes after we broke it off. today i completely ignored her and now feel bad because she was an amazing friend, but i don't know if i want to be friends wit a girl that was flirting right after we broke up.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i want to preface this by saying every word of this is true.  names and places have been changed to protect my anonymity and that of my family.  generally, anything in all caps has been changed, and nothing else.
i ordered a genealogyone (g1) dna test on september 1, 2015.  i had been working some overtime and when i did, i always took a portion of it to buy something a little indulgent, and this time, it was my g1 dna kit.  i got the results on tuesday oct 6.  the first thing i noticed was that my ethnicity was more english than i expected.  the contemporary knowledge of my background was irish and scottish.  while it was interesting that i would show up english, it was very easily explained as being intermixed with the irish-scottish.

what were more surprising were the g1 dna matches.  the first hit said, first cousin, confidence extremely high.  i am not an g1 subscriber, the plan was to get the dna match, see what came of it, and then possibly jump in for a 3 or 6 month stint when work slows down.  so for non-subscribers, you get a username and a picture, if the other person has shared one.  the picture was not anyone i recognize, the username was sskylars.  a first cousin implies my mother or father has a sibling out there.  so it was a very surprising result.  i sent sskylars a message via g1, with my grandparents’ surnames and asking if they connected with anyone in her known tree.  i continued to browse my matches, but i didn’t find anything particularly interesting.  you can view your matches, and your matches that you have in common with one of your matches, i.e. people on sskylars’s dna match list who also match my dna.  sskylars kept coming up as a common match, over and over.  the data visible to a non-subscriber is limited; i don’t see their family trees, so i didn’t think my money was wasted, just that it really required a subscription to fully explore.  that was planned for later.

but i kept coming back to sskylars.  she was listed as a common match for almost every one of my dna matches.  i took to google.  in short order, i found a pinterest account identifying sskylars as shmi skywalker lars.  i dug deeper into the googles.  i came across a facebook account that matches the full name, and includes pictures.  one of the pictures was the same photo used for g1 – jackpot.  i browse what’s publicly available on facebook, again, not that much, and send her a facebook message.  work has been very busy – overtime, remember – so i left it at that for a day or so.

returning to the googles with shmi’s full name, i continued searching.  i found obituaries for matt skywalker and for silven “steve” tusken.  matt skywalker was her brother who died relatively young.  tusken was her step father.  the obits helped me figure out who all shmi’s siblings were and which that tusken was her step father.  i started googling those names.  gradually i had reconstructed her family tree back to all her grandparents and some of her great grandparents.  its worth noting at this point, everyone in her family lineage was in and around tatooine, while my family was all around corellia, and no one’s surnames matched up with any of mine.  for our purposes, corellia is a major city on the east coast of the us.  tatooine is another state in another time zone.  if we were first cousins or even second cousins, i should have come across a common name by now.  the skywalker family was very extensively researched, and shmi’s brother, anakin, was fairly active across g1 message boards about the skywalker family.  one of the postings included an email address, so i decided to reach out to him.  i emailed him thursday at 1pm.

anakin got back to me the same day, about 5pm.  he generally shared my confusion about how our families might fit together.  his family tree was very extensively researched, and he knew a great deal about y-chromosome dna testing (y-test).  there was a large skywalker family y-test sample set, compiled over many years.  however g1 uses autosomal dna testing (a-test), which anakin knew little about.  we reviewed surnames back another generation, without any matches.  at this point i had also googled the reliability of g1 dna matches.  i admit, i had fallen for marketing hype and done little to research whether this was a good buy, so i was wondering whether i had been burned.  anakin, with an extensive knowledge of the y-test also took it on himself to research g1 dna testing methodology.  anakin’s conclusion was, in short, that technology had passed his family research project by.  the a test used by g1 was a much more robust test than the y-test that his family had been performing for years.  my research indicated some misgivings about g1 dna, but not the kind of widespread internet rage you’d expect from a $99 ripoff.  finally, i shared a list of my shmi-common matches with anakin, and the years of mine, my sister’s, my parents and grandparents births.  ostensibly this was to help anakin determine where, generationally, our trees might mesh.  but at this point, i closed my email to him with the words, “i'm afraid that short of both of our families having a closely guarded secret of adoption or infidelity, there is just no plausible way we are related within the last 3 generations.”  in a nutshell, i was ready to give up.

the next morning, anakin, still via email, expressed that the last bit of data i shared with him had confirmed his theory, and that we should discuss.  we ultimately got in touch by phone on friday oct 9, 10:03 am.
we exchanged pleasantries, and anakin asked if my parents were still together, because it might change how what he has to say is taken, and that what he has to say may be “startling.”  he had wrestled with whether and what to tell me, but that ethically, he thought this was the right thing to do.  he goes on to say that if he is right, shmi is not my first cousin, she is my aunt, and that he is my biological father.  startling is a good word.  mind-blowing would be a better one.  he explains while his family history is in tatooine, from year1-year4 he attended corellia community college (ccc).  at this point, i genuinely believe he is about to tell me that he had a relationship with my mom.  but he didn’t.  from year2 to year4, he had been a sperm donor at a local fertility clinic.  i was born in year3.  i asked him the doctor’s name, and he had it readily.  the clinic advertised in ccc’s student newspaper, one of his classmates had done it and gradually a few others got in on it.  

add a piece of information that he did not have: i know that my parents had difficulty conceiving.  to what degree, when, where they might have been treated: i don’t know.

he discussed some family dynamics, what i might think of my family, what he has told his (nothing to date), and appropriately waffled between being willing to engage with me and not wanting to intrude in my life or family dynamic.

the clinic was very confidential about the eventual success or failure of donations, and went so far as to say much of the time, they didn’t even know.  however, once the nurse had let slip that a beautiful baby girl had been born thanks to him.  that answered one of the only two questions that my mind could actually form.  the second was whether there were health issues i should know about – there weren’t.

other interesting things he told me about his experience as a donor was that he was in demand.  there were not a lot of jedi (a physical attribute) donors.  he also said that he was told parents would frequently pull out a donor from the descriptions who matched a purported father, or the mother, or some model that the couple wants to match.  he also said that he is 6’, and has color1 eyes.

obviously, my mind was blown.  this was all too fantastic to even wrap my head around.  after getting off the phone, i called my wife (/u/justcallmemarajade) and related the story to her.  i got back to my desk; coworkers were leaving for lunch.  i called wedge on the way, because i just had to tell someone.  it was all too overwhelming.

my follow up from this was to google the doctor – confirmed works or at least worked at the corellia clinic at ccc.  i googled anakin extensively, hoping for maybe a picture that might be informative.  i did not find one.
the rest of the afternoon was spent being mind blown.  i also googled alternative dna services, other ways this match could be confirmed.  g1 will let you download your raw data, but it was blocked at work, so that would have to wait.  genealogytwo (g2) allowed you to upload it into their system for free.

once i got home, i performed the raw data download and the upload to g2.  it said that processing could take up to 48 hours.  if you have ever gotten to the end of a tv episode and screamed when you saw, “to be continued”, multiply that by 10,000.  i took back to the internet to search things like how to match y-test results with raw g1 dna data.  the skywalker y-test is very well studied, it has distinctive markers that are published online i could use to review.  unfortunately there’s not.  i ordered a y-test from g2.  fortunately, g2 did beat their prediction by about 47 hours.  my mind was not done being blown.

g2 lets you upload your data for free, but that only leads you to a teaser to purchase “complete” upload.  that is to say, it shows you vague initials of your matches, and anywhere you click for more info leads you to pay $40 to upgrade and complete your registration.  but i was sufficiently teased.  just when i thought my mind was entirely blown, top hit: l organa, “half siblings, grandparent/ grandchild, aunt/ uncle, niece/ nephew”.   i tried to google l organa a bit, but did not receive any promising leads.  i looked into purchasing the “complete” upload, but there was a website error, so i gave up for the night and tried to sleep.  friday night ended.

saturday morning began with purchasing the complete upload.  once that was complete, i was able to see more info on my matches.  l organa was leia organa, and once paid, g2 was very accommodating with just: bam here’s her email address.  which i googled.  she is a realtor in selonia (a suburb of corellia).  i emailed her to say, hi we’re a match, we should compare notes.  i also forwarded her information to anakin.

a little bit later, anakin called me again to discuss leia.  he revealed to me, that based on his searching since i had forwarded her info, she was too young to be the product of his donation.  instead, he disclosed that in year10, his girlfriend became pregnant, and that a girl was given up for adoption.  this timeline more closely fit leia’s age.  apparently i have not just one, but now two half sisters.

later that day, leia returned my email.  her message confirmed that she was adopted, that she had little or no info on her parents, but she would be interested in comparing notes.  i forwarded this to anakin, and he shortly called me to discuss.  he outlined what i should say to leia.  the general theme was that many of the details, even those he had shared with me, were his to discuss with her and that i should limit discussing those with her.  i agreed.  i think the limits he gave me were more than i even intended on sharing.  i responded to leia by email, including my cell phone number, and said that we should talk and discuss.

the story was still just too fantastic.  despite all the evidence, i still just could not internalize this as reality.  and everything is still based on the fundamental reliability of the g1 test.  if that’s bad, everything else is just propagation of that error.  i had been searching other dna tools and found genealogythree (g3)	, which would analyze your g1 raw data for medical purposes for $5.  that’s a steal at twice the price.  it spits out an extensive report, and it pretty much destroyed any possibility that the g1 dna data was not mine.  it registered some general physical attributes, and strong risk factors for 2 specific medical conditions i take medication for.  one of them runs in my mother beru’s family.  any vestige of doubt died there.

sunday at 3:30, i got a call from leia solo (her married name).  i started out saying that i wouldn’t keep her in suspense, that i would skip to the end and then we can go back and fill in the blanks.  i know who her father is, we share a father, i wasn’t raised by him, never met him in person, but he’s alive, healthy and i’ve spoken to him in the last 24 hours.  she immediately asked his name, which i told her.  she had very limited information about her father, sourced to a social worker who worked with her family, that said his name is anakin, he is involved in blank business (her letter literally said “blank”), from tatooine, 6’ with jedi.  i gave her what details i knew, i knew very little about her mother but denied even that, because i thought it more appropriate for her to discuss that with anakin.  i told her that all three of us seemed generally agreed that no one wanted to adversely disrupt each others’ families.  she was very receptive, even excited when i suggested she and her husband have dinner with me and my wife.  she was interested in being contacted by anakin.  she told me, “you’re the first biological relative i’ve ever spoken to.”

i am still struggling to process all of this.  it just seems so far-fetched.  i don’t know what to tell my sister, who was born in year-2, so she can’t be anakins child.  presumably, she is the natural daughter of the man owen who i thought was my father when i got up friday morning.  i don’t resent my parents or feel betrayed.  i understand why they would do this, and why they would keep the secret all this time.  my parents don’t know that i know.  my sister doesn’t know, though now i can’t be sure who her father is.

every word of this is true.  obviously i am protecting my anonymity.  however i am willing to discuss with a mod privately verifying some key details.

 

*edit* formatting

*edit no. 2 update* i may have tentatively convinced my sister - let's call her abby because i'm out of relevant star wars names - to get dna tested for the purpose of the medical analysis.  she's not interested in the genealogical side, so she may just do it under my g1 account, which would let me see the match data.  you have to go through g1 or a similar service before taking that data to g3, they don't offer testing only analysis.  she was departing on a business trip so we will check back when she returns.

*edit no. 3 update* a 4th or 5th cousin, the kind of relationship you expect to find when you test dna on g1, says ive experienced an npe - non-paternal event, and it is not very rare. wanted to share that. oh and she matched me on g2.

*edit no. 3 update* anakin was telling me about his dad, who i guess we will have to call palpatine. also, i have a cousin in the corellia area, shmi's child. and this child was apparently at the same college as me for some overlapping time. also worth noting, anakin was in the blank business in the neighborhood i was living when i went to college. we probably lived within 3-5 miles of each other.

*edit no. 4 update* y test results confirmed the a test. talked to my mom. she said it was supposed to be my dad's sample. she seemed ok when i left. shocked but ok. my step dad says she was crying all night though. she said it would devastate my dad to find out.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened yesterday, but i'm honestly getting paranoid and shit.

in english class yesterday, we had an activity where we go to padlet.com and have an anonymous discussion on a book. it went pretty well,  but i had an idea that i thought would be hilarious. i figured i would go into the the  periods discussion that happened during my lunch and spam it with funny pictures and comments.

the next period comes around, and that happens to be my lunch period, and i knew that he wouldn't start it up right away, and i also knew he would immediately pull it up on the projector and board, so i got onto my school laptop and pulled up their wall (the link was already up on his website) and pointed it for everyone in my table to see the chaos go down. i open it up on my phone too so it can't be tracked to me.

step two comes in here. i open up a new tab and download a bunch of pictures of shrek. i post a collage of them and at the bottom of it was a picture of the original shrek is love 4chan post. i can almost hear the laughter of the class as the posts come in when the activity starts. my  comments like, ""lol wat?"" ""haha"" etc. my table cracks up laughing too. i refresh the page again and see that they have been removed. this is where it should have ended. instead, i push more...

i let the discussion get rolling then decide i'm gonna flood it again. i go through my phone and start posting random funny pictures. my table uproars, i refresh again, notice there are no more posts and mine have been deleted, i see that my posts have also been deleted. i post 3 more, then see that a post made by the teacher was made, it basically said that because students couldn't handle taking the discussion seriously, the wall has been shut down. this is where i go past what i have now considered the point of no return. thinking that no one would see, and that this definitely wouldn't be seen on the projector at the front of the class but would still make my table laugh, i posted a very lewd and inappropriate picture of jessica rabbit masturbating.  i refresh the page for 5 seconds so my whole table could see, and there it was, my table uproars with laughter. i leave lunch feeling like a champion. the very next period, i hear from someone in that class what happened, (no one knows it was me, i was waiting to hear what the reaction was to let everyone know.)  apparently he got really pissed after all the other pictures, and closed the wall down,  but not on the projector, so when i posted the picture of jessica rabbit, he must've hit refresh or something, because suddenly there she was, staring at you in all her nude glory.

after the school day ends, the story had gotten around pretty well, and i heard quite a few people talk about it on my way out to the bus. i decide not to tell people quite yet, but i'm tempted. 

this brings me to today, i have a friend who tells me that basically he has banned everyone from the in class computers until the guilty people (when it's actually person) own up. this class has been done completely through computers up to this point. he is also very pissed. when i get to the class, my fears are confirmed. he is livid. he tells us that we are doing everything pen and paper for as long as the perpetrators don't own up publicly, all semester if he has to. i think about owning up, but not to all of it, especially the porn and realize that wouldn't help because not everyone owned up to all of it. this sucks, but i think i'll make it. i'm starting to get paranoid though, because i don't know who all knows it was me and if they'll snitch. and if i'm found out, i could get suspended. then, lunch period comes around and i tell everyone around me that knows to please stop talking about it and that what happened doesn't leave this table or i could risk suspension. one of them tells me that everyone would be pissed cause that means i also get kicked out of marching band. i go through the rest of the day and start hearing students telling me about how they want to beat the shit out  whoever  did it, even my own cousin says she wants to hurt that person. she was in that class that it happened. 

guys and gals, this brings me to here. i'm really worried and paranoid. but to me it seems to be more on the side of not telling. on one hand, we have me getting suspended, which leads to disappointment from my parents, the loss of privileges and kicked out of marching band, something really important to me, and possibly getting denied from a college due to that reason because i fucked up once. then there's shunning from my friends and other school mates and have no computers for 14 weeks in that class. if i fess up, we have computers for an extra 45 minutes during the day and slightly less writing to do. i'd like your guys' advice and/or consolations but i think it'd take something earth shattering to make me tell what i've done.

edit: tl; dr: pranked an online english class activity by posting pictures, one including porn. teacher is pissed, classmates hate the anonymous prankster, i'm risking suspension and my future and my marching band. need advice.

to cut a long story short, i was returning from a day out with my mates (it was around 1am and obviously dark.) i was driving up a country lane roughly 30 seconds from my house when this four legged, cat-like creature runs out in front of my car from the hedge.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: background: i work it for a large hospital organization, i just transferred two weeks ago onto a new team. although i am new to this team, i am not new to this company. we also do a large part of our company communication through ms lync/skype.

i started on this team two weeks ago. today one of my co-workers gary, broad shouldered black guy with a deep voice, comes up to me and says, ""hey dude, what's with all the heart emoticons on im. it's not cool man.""

at first, i though he was trolling me. this team is notorious for pulling pranks and giving each other shit for everything. he said i have been sending them in group chats and to him. he told me the other day we had a meeting and i sent a heart to everyone when we announced the meeting time. he thought it was for him, and that i was publicly declaring affection towards him, it creeped him out. especially since i am a normal and cool guy around the office.

turns out, my boss thought that heart was for him, and so did every other member on my team. they all said i have been sending them heart emoticons. at this point, i was calling everyone out saying this is an inside joke. i thought i left my computer unlocked maybe? but i am pretty good about that cause i fuck with other people when they leave their screens unlocked.

it turns out, i was sending them all hearts. but the thing is i thought i was sending them a smiley with sunglasses on. you see, microsoft bought skype, and they are migrating to skype for enterprise communications. well we were doing a soft roll-out which stopped. i happen to be the last one with lync in the company. and on lync a smiley face with sunglasses is (h) for short, this also happens to be the symbol for a heart on skype.

so while i thought i was sending a cool smiley to everyone, it turns out they were all receiving hearts. they would get these anytime they said thanks or at the end of every conversation.

the worst part.... i sent my first one to my new boss, after he offered me this position. when i told him my mistake he says, ""i was starting to wonder man, i can only deal with so much gay affection"" we are both married btw.

and i froze. i watched. i was 3 feet away and knew what could possibly happen if those doors weren't opened. or at least, i could imagine. suddenly a guy on my left jumps up and starts to pull on the doors. and i still didn't move. i sat there and stared with a look of mild disinterest i could feel on my face.

the doors opened suddenly and the woman quickly stepped inside while regaining her balance, right before the shut again, almost on someone else. so she got away with a mild scare, the left guy showed his mocho-ness, and i learned how easily i freeze up.

input: Text: it is about what i have been doing today after a night of thinking about it.

it is long, sorry. 

i have been working as a ""coordinator"" for a company in postal code area e3 (east london), london for 3 months and i have been overworking a lot because of the employer, this indian lady whose name is b.j., one i thought was decent initially. 

instead she is a cheat and fraud, as all the students of the courses that she prepare and i have to coordinate do nothing; it is me and another colleague of mine (poor guy, he is so patient and willing to work for real and doesn't deserve to work there as well) that have to complete and correct and evaluate! and for each student there are at least 30 units! units for ""university access"" courses! 

also, exams of other nature, like ""pick the answer"" exams style or level 1-2-3-4 exams for mathematics, english and whatever are supposed to be completed by us.

and among this, all other side jobs that just would delay us, including once a scaffolding job while wearing the quite smart garments, without any warning from her the day before and lasting for 5-6 hours, happen!

this indian lady, mother of two (poor children) has been expecting always too much, pretending ""perfectly unique and customized and not plagiarized"" reports\texts"" whatever for all of these units for the students. 

of course i just got stuff online and used some automatic word changer, then checking if stuff was contextual.
 
and we were ""apprentices"", not full time workers.... she made us work often ""until everything was finished"", which meant even until 8pm or even midnight! why? to cover her cheats!

just last week, 7 hours on saturday and nine on sunday too. and this has happened various times already too, but not so badly. and she never was satisfied with what we were doing. 

now, she has two ""underlings"", p.f. and z.b: one is a british smug buffoon that think that ""dress code"" make the worker (bullshit, people call me ""sir"" just because of my aura and kindness, not because of ""smart dressing"") while the other is a dirty, filthy sand n@ò!er that doesn't know anything about nothing yet bullies co-workers because ""he is the operation manager"". this z.b. guy made cry 3 of my female co-workers and two of them left because of him, as they couldn't tell him to stop pressurizing them because of the pressure he created on them! 

and one of these girls was only a 16 year old trainee, as sweet young girl that i hope will have luck with everything. a third lady is going away as well.

well, today, after a night of thought, i told myself this: ""i will go there, pretend everything starts as normal, but print 100 copies of my newly updated cv with their printer, say the assholes to fuck themselves for what they are, in the name of the people that have been abused by them, then look for some real job, as i am tired of being exploited despite everything i did for them myself, even bringing my own resources to help them out, never receiving a 'thank you' for the effort'!""

i did it. now i am looking for some other job.

it was reckless and stupid, but i have a dignity and i want to be treated as a human being by anyone, because i expect kindness and professionalism to be rewarded somehow. too often people let other people exploit them by putting aside their sake and dignity for the sake of ""success"".

now they are phoning me a lot because they know they are nothing without my it skills and knowledge of languages, begging me to go back to their office. 

how would you have reacted, too?

okay so first off, the obligatory ""this didn't happen today"" but it did happen a few weeks ago.
a couple of mates and i decided to catch the train into the city (we live in the suburbs) and as a result we obviously had to catch a train back. now the train station in the city is pretty big (by my countries standards) and is constantly full of people.

we arrived at the train station and up until then i had been holding in a rather larger shit, which by then was practically turtle necking. so i quickly mentioned to my friends where i was off to and powerwalked my way into the little boys room to take care of business. this particular poop was a little messy and left quite a bit of residue on the inside of my cheeks, so it took a lot of wiping and by the time i had finished the used tp in the bowl was rubbing against my cheeks, it didn't help that the toilet was shallow either.
 i finished my business and made my outside and stroll over to where my mates were waiting for me. they took one look at me and started laughing. i stared confused until one of them quietly said to me ""dude, you uh got some toilet paper hanging out of the back of your pants.""
there had been so much paper in the bowl a small trail of it had stuck to my butt when i got up and put my pants back on. i quickly reached behind me and plucked it from the inside of my underwear, at this point my friends were in hysterics, there was even shit on the toilet paper. i hastily balled it up and discarded it on the floor away from me. keep in mind that there was a lot of people around as they made their way to and from work and as a result a lot of people probably saw. 
i was red, my friends were laughing and the group of guys sitting near were quietly pointing and laughing at me. we couldn't have gotten out of there sooner.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this saga has been happening all semester, and earlier today i became aware of my fuck up.

i'm an american student currently studying abroad in london. my roommates and i are staying in university sponsored housing, which has its own maintenance service. 

our kitchen sink has periodically been backing up over the course of the semester. recently, however, it seems like i have to call maintenance every other week to unclog our sink. i've been extremely careful about what actually goes down the drain since the second time the sink backed up, and i've told my roommates to be careful as well. 

last week, only days after we called maintenance, the sink started to get backed up again. for some reason, i'm the only one who ever lets maintenance know when our sink is backed up. i was tired of calling them, and i was a bit embarrassed that they had to keep coming back, so i decided to take matters into my own hands. it can't be that hard to unclog a sink, right? wrong.

logically, my first place to look for a solution to my problem was the internet. i looked up how to unclog a sink and got two options: a snake or a baking soda/white vinegar mixture. next, i called my grandpa because he's the person i always call when i need advice on fixing things around the house. he said a snake would be a lot of work, and that i should get drano. i've used drano at home multiple times on my own shower/sink, and white vinegar is hard to come by over here, so i thought drano was a pretty good idea. 

when i went to the hardware store on saturday, i asked for a snake, but they didn't have the right one for my drain (seriously??). they did, however, have a chemical similar to clean out the drain. alright, that's what grandpap said would work, so i got it. 

i go home and use it. six minutes later, the drain is unclogged, the sink is empty, and life is great. 

about a few hours later, the sink starts to drain slower and slower. this continues until today, and again i'm fed up. i try unclogging the drain again with the chemical without success. when i go and return the chemical to under the sink, i realize the pipes are leaking! so, now not only is my draining extremely slowly, but because of the drano-like chemical, there's a hole in my pipes! i've called emergency maintenance, and now i'm waiting for them to fix my fuck up and hopefully this damn drain.

""hey buddy,"" i quipped, ""do we need to call a tow truck?""

at this comment, my other two-year-old son's interest was piqued by the mention of a truck. ""truck?"" he asked. 

my robust chuckle was of no resolve to his earnest inquiry. he asked again in an escalatingly frantic tone, ""truck? truck! truck!"" and thus commenced a full-scale toddler meltdown because there wasn't an actual truck to back my glorious attempt at humor. 

there was screaming, crying, thrashing, and flailing for many minutes thereafter; trucks are no joking matter. 

at least i laughed.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i have this amazing talent where i somehow manage to trash my room within a week of cleaning it. one day it's immaculate, and three days later there are clothes, books, papers, and all sorts of junk strewn across my desk and floor. somehow, though, i manage to motivate myself enough to clean all the clutter up again. 
now, it's sunday and midnight approaches. i am sitting on my bed deciding that i might as well get over it and clean up a bit before i head off to sleep. i crouch down to pick up some papers and something darts out from underneath, taking shelter underneath another stack of papers. being the huge wuss that i am and always have been, i jump backwards with much more force than i need to. big mistake, seeing as how my bed is directly behind me. there is a huge *thud* as my back impacts with my bed. to say it hurts is an understatement. blinking back tears, i can already tell that this night is not going to be an easy one. of course, i do what i normally do when i encounter a bug that i have been left alone to fight with: convulse and slap myself all over to make sure the motherfucker didn't crawl on me. and then proceed to kill it with an ""elaborate plan"". i take a hangar and prod the stack of papers with it, and the bug- which turns out to be a horrifically fast spider- dashes out. over the course of about 45 minutes, i battle this thing like an idiot. first i blow on it repeatedly to get it out into plain sight... only to have it scuttle into a corner, nestled against the door frame. blowing on it isn't getting it out, so i must improvise. i grab my perfume and begin spraying the shit out of it, and it runs out again, this time hugging the wall. i realize that the perfume is extremely effective, so i drive it out into the middle of an open space as my room starts to strongly smell of sweet pea. i stare at it for a number of minutes before tearing my eyes away to grab an empty gatorade bottle to smash it with. except when i look back, it's gone. as i mentioned before, the fiend is freakishly fast. i look around warily as i stand on the patch of carpet. i am just about to say 'fuck it' and throw everything aside when i glimpse movement. 
the eight-legged spawn of satan is on my backpack. my stomach drops. you might not have noticed, but i freak around bugs, especially when they're on the thing that i carry on my back five days a week. panicking even more than i was before, i ready my perfume again and spray repeatedly. at first, it seems to be heading off of my backpack and into the loving embrace of the bottom of my gatorade bottle. but, of course, it turns around and slips inside my backpack.
i haven't seen it since. after witnessing it enter the one place i had hoped it wouldn't climb into, i just sort of drifted into my bed, curled up into a ball, and wept. of course, the next thing that comes to mind after such a traumatizing incident is reddit, and here i am at a half past one in the morning on a monday.

i really should just dump out the damn thing and step on it instead of reacting so strongly, but that's not going to happen. after the whole ordeal, my back is seriously begging me to lie down and not give a damn until tomorrow.

fast forward about three hours after the procedure and we're on our way home. mom is complaining she is thirsty, so we stop at a gas station. she hops out and says she going to grab a drink and will be right back. i stay in the car thinking nothing could go wrong. i wait about 5 mins and finally start to wonder whats taking so long, i get out of the car and walk inside to find my mother soaked in pop and arguing with the store manager. apparently, she attempted to stick her head under the soda dispenser and drink from that instead of getting a cup. when the manager told her to stop, she laughed, still feeling the effects from the surgery. to make matters worse the store manager didn't believe anything i was telling him.

 

edit 1: yes op is an asshole, can confirm. i failed to confirm the post was free of typos before sending. i gave the manager 5$ and called it a day. i figured that would cover what ever the cost of the pop she drank was. when i called my mother to see if she remembered she didn't have a clue as to what went on after the surgery. i'm not sure if she's planning on going back to apologize or not.

input: Text: this week was my first week of college. i'm starting off small with only two classes a week, but either way, since i don't have a car, let alone a driver's licence yet, naturally i'd have to take the bus, since walking or biking would be too far away.

now, i've never in my life been on a city bus before, but i still felt well-prepared. my phones gps app was raring to go with directions down to the minute, i got to the bus stop 10 minutes earlier, nothing would seem to be able to go wrong, right? 

my first mistake was putting in my headphones. i'd always done this while taking the school bus, and i felt confident the gps would be able to tell me when i needed to get off. unfortunately, i hadn't set up all the location options, so it lagged quite a bit. by the time we made it to my stop, i only noticed just as the driver was departing once again. i signaled him to stop, but he said to get off at the next stop.

okay, no big deal. just edit the route in my phone. okay now to wait for the bus. hmm... there's a lot of bus stops on one road, is that my bus? nope. that one? yeah! that's the one! oh, wait, this isn't really a bus stop? well, whatever, he'll still let me on right? i mean he's stop -- oh, wait, no he's waving me off (to which a random guy points his thumb at the bus and says my exact thought to me: ""asshole""). ooookay, well, let's not get discouraged, i still have 30 minutes before class starts.  

-30 minutes later-

well, fuck it! i suck at getting on a bus! fuck me right! well, my class already started, and the next route to get there won't get there until the class is almost done, so you know what i'm fucking done. i'm a-goin' home.

hey! a bus driver that actually fucking stops! well, seems like smooth sailing from here. and now my gps is working properly! wait, how do i request a stop again? wait... shit, was that my stop? fuck. a. duck. alright i'll just get off at the next stop, which happens to be at the movie theater i usually go to, but is still over an hour to walk there, in 95° with full backpack. 

shit, better call mom. (sad, i know) oh, she's in a meeting. it'll take her 45 minutes to get here. well, at least there's a chinese restaurant over yonder. ""i'll have the orange chicken"" why does that one asian family keep staring at me? you know what, i'll give the waiter an extra big tip, cause someone should at least have a better day than me.

input: Text: 12am gmt: i am laying in bed watching family guy on my phone with the window open to get rid of the smell of boredom and teenage hormones, when i can hear a noise from my garden. i assumed it was foxes or something so i just ignored it.
12.30 am: the next door neighbours go outside for a cigarette, as i could tell with their outside light brightening my room. i listen out, and all i can hear is the click of a lighter
1am: the noise is becoming frequent, and with the squeak being followed by a bang, i can tell it's the door on the shed opening and closing. i look outside through the crack in my curtain, wary of the possibility of a rapist, foxes or a hentai-inspired combination of the two.
1.10am: the noise of the shed can be eliminated by closing the window, but i think of the neighbours. it is early morning on friday, after all.
1.20am: i go outside to padlock the door of the shed.
1.22am: i start the 10-yard journey inside, but for some inexplicable reason i forgot that there are a couple of steps that separate the grassy area where the shed lives and the concrete portion which leads to the door and storage for random crap. because i forgot about the steps, i caught the edge of the top step with my heel and landed arse-first on the icy concrete. because i had momentum, i slid with both feet outwards (roy keane would have been proud of this technique) for about a foot until i clattered into a watering can and a stack of plastic boxes which contained firewood. my eyes were closed, but i could tell what i happened as i could feel an icy wet sensation on my crotch, followed by the sound of containers containing pieces of wood smacking against the floor. ""you fucking cunt"", i yelled, at the exact same time multiple dogs started barking at the noise i had created.

it is just over 30 minutes after this incident, and one of the dogs is still barking loud enough to penetrate my now closed window. the grumpy people who are now awake will not understand the irony.

input: Text: about a month ago, i was beyond thrilled to finally see the man i look up to and my favorite comedian, jim jefferies, live for the first time ever. i had anxiously awaited the day for months, had somehow managed to score free rooms at a casino venue and life was good. i invited my sister and her friends as a treat for not only my birthday but also hers. luck found us and we were complemented with 2 extra tickets for her friends. we spent the day like any other at a casino, some gambling here, some drinks there, fun stuff. it was a great time. 


hours went by and my wallet was doing pretty good, drinks came around often which, as some of you may not know, are free if you’re on the floor in hopes that you gamble more. mimosas, white russians, greyhounds, grateful deads, white wine, red wine, beer, sex on the beach, etc. things were getting foggy, the bonding time with my sister was much needed, i don’t recall us having a time like this before… it’s 7pm.. arrived at noon… has it really been seven hours? 


we hadn’t eaten since the ride out, as the bartender slipped us some pretzels we realized that the show starts promptly at eight. we raced to the room to get ready, things were becoming more foggy on the way. 


queue jim jefferies entrance. fucking brilliant he is. somehow more luck found us, our 5th row seats landed us in the front row which was unoccupied. a waitress comes around, again the drinks are free. we asked for wines, and they didn’t skimp either. these were the tall boys, the fucking holy grails of red wine that sent us over the edge. in the moment i recall his performance nothing less of spectacular, you ask me today and it pains me that we drank so much that i can’t remember.


this is where my sister and i become black out. i remember blips of shouting out references to legit, and my sister unknowingly would follow suit. this happened a lot. enough to make jim pause during the performance and wait, wait for the two drunken dicks (at the time) to finish yelling semi-understandable references. her friends were a section back and by the time the show was over you could see the anger in their faces.


after the show we still didn’t grasp how misconstrued our perception on the situation was. we met jim outside for pictures, thanked him, had a laugh and went on our way. i also saw some high school friends there and jim told me sternly to “go have your reunion elsewhere”. 


we didn’t talk to my sisters friends much that night. we did see jim a second time on the casino floor at about 3am (after a lot more drinking) shook his hand and thanked him for the awesome show.


after a hell of a hangover, upon waking, i discovered that i had recorded six minutes of the show on my phone. call it fate, but i never would have grasped how shitty i acted if this hadn’t been the case. the sheer anguish i felt after watching how ridiculous we acted.. right in the feels. i dun goofed, dun fucked up. to this day my stomach turns when i think of it. i had second thoughts about posting, but i guess it feels better to get this out. i turned my hero into an enemy and turned what could have been one of the greatest times in recent memory, into one of the shittiest. 


 


jim, if you ever read this i did sincerely want to apologize. i think the world of you and am inspired by your work. bring back legit. love you, dude.  and… sorry.

input: Text: this happened many years ago when i was a teenager, but i still cringe when i think about it. 
so i used to work at a kennel that was owned by a veterinarian. he was a really nice guy, and he even hooked me up with some free routine health checks for my dog. i really liked the guy, but his last name was too easy to make fun of with a simple curse word. 
one night i was working with a female co-worker and her boyfriend. we were all having a good time joking around and just making the best out of our time at work. so i decided, hey! this is the perfect time to make my joke about the bosses last name! so i said his last name with my ""clever"" modification. no response from my co-worker or her boyfriend. so me thinking that my joke was too good not to get a laugh, they must not have heard me. i said it again...and again. still no response. ok, maybe it wasn't that funny, so i stop. finally the boyfriend says ""hey, you know that (co-workers name) is (bosses name) daughter right?"" shit.
no i didn't know who she was. 18 year old me never bothered asking last names. it was my first time (and last time) working with her. i quit that night due to shame.
it was pretty awkward going back to get my last check. nobody smiled, nobody said anything to me, nobody even looked at me. needless to say, when it asked ""may we contact your previous employer?"" on my next job application, i checked the ""no"" box.

input: Text: obligatory disclaimer, this didn't happen today, it happened years ago in high school.

my boyfriends brother bought a large amount of a popular brand of water flavouring concentrate, and my boyfriend wanted to try it. it says right on the package that you shouldn't drink it right from the bottle and that it should be diluted, but, of course my boyfriend put a few drips right into his mouth. he said it was good, so naturally i tried a drip or two myself. it is so concentrated and extremely sour that i immediately started salivating so much that my mouth fills. the sensation wore off, and we forgot about it.

a few hours later, he left his room to the kitchen and returned with water flavoured with the concentrate. he also brought the bottle itself back with him. we started getting into it, and he got the bright idea that he will put it on his penis and i was supposed to lick it off. i remembered what it had done to my mouth earlier, but before i could protest, he was already dripping it on. immediately he started screaming because it was burning so badly, so to relieve the pain i tried to lick it off.

my mouth started salivating, even more than the first time, and it was dripping everywhere. and this isn't just any old day to day salivating, this is like right before you're about to vomit, or if you eat one of those extremely sour candies. the amount of concentrate that entered my mouth made me salivate enough to probably fill a pool. this concentrate also has dye in it, which happens to stain skin and everything else very strongly. the dye mixed with my saliva and it allowed the volume of this dye to increase tenfold. i absolutely could not contain all this saliva in my mouth, so his hands, entire abdomen, and pelvic area were stained red and so were my mouth, chin, neck, and hands. it was horribly embarrassing when his parents asked me why my face was covered in red dye, and i said i spilled the water with the concentrate in it, but i think they knew something was up. 

please tell me we weren't the only idiots that did this.

this is a cautionary tale, don't put concentrate on your penis. or your vagina. or on anything.

2) there's a break up note half way written to her so

by this point i text her and tell her we're home and ask if everything is alright.

3) i go in the bathroom and there's blood on my toilet. ew. 

4) go back and look at pile of my clothes. included are some of my bras and panties that have obviously been worn.

5) i go into the closet (i have many) that she would have gotten those clothes from and notice my sex toys have been moved around. realize one of my dildos is definitely missing and my corsets and fishnets aren't in the right place.

6) go back into my bathroom and find said dildo in shower.

i tell my so about how my clothes are worn (didn't mention dildo) and suggest we shouldn't trust her anymore. he tells me i'm overreacting until he discovers his favorite cookies are gone and goes all hellllll noooooo, who eats another person's cookies?

anyway, today i went to work. i'm a cater waiter. in my company we wear all black uniforms (we mostly cater weddings and fancy-ish events). today we were doing an event that was partially outside, so the heat was ungodly and the black uniforms made it even worse. but, it could be worse, we do stuff like this all the time, clients are generally understanding if we get kinda sweaty on days like this. except i notice that i'm not actually sweating. that's odd. if there were any other symptoms i would think it's heatstroke, but since there aren't any besides a dry dress shirt i shrug it off and call it good fortune.

when i get home for the day i strip down to my underwear (as one does) and go to get myself some food, when i look over my shoulder and see that my skin has turned into this: http://imgur.com/o9fulye

hundreds, literal hundreds, of little raised fluid-filled bumps. see, turns out i actually was sweating the whole time, but because of my sunburn and the peely, gross layer of skin on top, all of the sweat got trapped underneath. i look like i've got a mild case of leprosy, all on my shoulders, arms and half way down my back

(i have 0 maternal skills) anyway, i was very frustrated at the large group i was dealing with and their inability to ever do anything right without me screaming incessantly. 

this day i was at the breaking point, every word i said was lost in the void of screaming and crying children. i finally told them to swim a long distance so that i could cool myself down. all the kids who tried to escape the distance by going to the bathroom were mercilessly denied.

i look to my right and i see one of the kids putting about at the swim fin bin. i had told them to get fins at the beginning of practice. i was in disbelief, why does no one listen. 

i walked over and demanded to know why it had taken her so long. she says ""i can't find another fin.""  she's holding a red colored fin, i look to see a red colored fin on top of the pile. ""there's one right here!!!"" i exclaimed furiously. ""if you want to get out of swimming then you might as well come up with a better excuse."" a very cold statement but i felt justified.

when i looked at her face i realized that i had done something horribly wrong. it seemed like slow motion as i looked down at her feet to see that one of them had seven toes and that foot was a lot larger than the other.

i felt like such an ass.

first off im typing on moble because of said fu so if there are any typos i'll fix them later, and this happened about 30 minutes ago.

i was playing cs:go on skype with some friends and we were having an ok game until the 2nd half in which we lost horribly. we say good night and get off. at this point i'm just watching some youtube and i reach for my water bottle on the back of my desk, also on the back of my desk there is a galileo thermometer i got a couple of years ago, and i use it to tell if it's too hot in my room. any way i reach for my water bottle and of course my dumb ass hand fucking knocks over the thermometer and in falls into my pc breaking in the process. at this point i have only one thing going through my head ""wow this is going to make a great tifu"" kappa...no the only thing i can think at this point is ""holy shit wtf"" as i frantically try to turn it off. after about five seconds i just opted to pull the plug. it was at this point i start to smell it. kerosene. now that i know this stuff is flammable i get my pc unplugged from every thing asafp and start to hull this thing down stairs. i place it on the dining room table and get to work disassembling it. 15 minutes go by and i have it taken apart. every component is set next to a fan to evaporate and i am going to work with rags and q tips. i'm going to leave it over night and hopefully everything will work tomorrow i will update with news and pics if you guys want to see.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so my boyfriend and i are both nightshift people and we usually get to bed just as the sun is finally making it's way back into our lives. we're usually hella tired but he will usually pass out about an hour before i do and wake about an hour before i do. unfortunately, that doesn't really leave much opportunity for me to initiate ""morning"" sex, which has always been something we really enjoyed. it's intimate, cuddly, sweet, and passionate; all at the same time, ftw. 

so i found a solution this morning. he usually sleeps like a rock and can wake up for brief, non-intensive periods and have no trouble getting back to sleep. honestly, i don't know why i didn't think of this sooner. i let him sleep a couple hours and then go into the bedroom. i start smooching him, letting things take a natural course when, while i'm going down on him, he moans out a   name.

not mine, mind you. now, i should also mention that we're in an open relationship. he's been seeing (name redacted) on and off for a couple months and it doesn't bother me. what does bother me is... dude... i know you're half asleep but surely you know that she didn't sneak into our house and start on you while i slept right next to you guys. 

his reaction was perfection though. the second it was out of his mouth, his eyes shot wide open and he looked down at me. ""oh my god, (my name), i am so sorry. i suck and you will never do this again for me ever now, will you?""

i laughed because he was just so stupidly cute about the way he reacted to it, i couldn't actually be upset. it was an honest mistake. i climbed up next to him to cuddle and informed him that, yes, i would happily be doing this again, but because of his fuck up, next morning-ish sex was on him.

on the upside, i'm pretty sure i'm getting laid here in a few hours when he wakes up. so that's cool.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: like many a tifu before me, this involves a girl, a man's stupidity, and a sign of hope. unlike many tifu's however, this is actually tomorrow.  
this tale begins with myself, an attractive, intelligent and humble university student, in the midst of his exams. the university i am attending is rather small in terms of campus, so it has to have it's exams externally, in this case, the city. i had just finished a particularly challenging exam, one that many had been dreading, and was walking with my friends and fellow students to the train station to make my way home, when i had the idea, and i suggested that we go get a drink, but they said they were going home. fair enough i mean, we still had another exam the next day.

among my friends were mostly guys, plus this one girl, we'll call her sam, who, although most people wouldn't find her that attractive, i reckon is at least a 8/10, (and yes, she has a kate/10), and have had a crush on since i met her. i've been trying to figure out a way to ask her out, but we've both been really busy with our studies, which we both take seriously, and haven't had time to go out, to even give me the chance to try and hook up.  
i hadn't suggested it to try and hang out with her specifically, more of a general wind down, but it seems that she had read into my idea as given by her messaging me later today, that her brain wasn't working well today and that maybe next time she'd be in. she also used several smiley faces, something she doesn't do much in group chats, so i think she may be into me.  
it's still tentative, but i think i may have a chance. it is my hope that i won't have to submit an actual tifu, but if i do, at least you'll enjoy it, you sadistic brethren.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened a while ago but it's worth telling. so it was late night with my friend ed and my other friend edd and we were out drinking and smoking weed all night so edd agreed to me and ed crashing at his house for the night. so we got to his house and when we got in, everyone was already asleep... or so we thought. we were lucky to go to his house at that specific time because not long after we got inside, a thunderstorm had started and had come to stay.

so we went all the to the top floor where his room is basically 3/4 of the whole top floor and he also has a bathroom in his room. after a while of nothingness but the storm getting more and more violent and lying on the bed we decided to roll up some joints and go smoke in his bathroom. so we go in and we light up and not much longer after that the bathroom gets completely filled with smoke to the point that the only thing we can see clearly is the light coming from the flame of the joint, for the foggy smoke clouded the bathroom because the windows weren't open. while we were in the bathroom, we were all being extremely loud especially at the point where edd told a joke which made us all laugh hysterically and uncontrollably for a while, until

***shazam***

we hear a door slam shut from outside of the bathroom, and due to lack of good judgement, all we did was pause for about 5 seconds and once again burst out laughing out loud with no control over our laughter. seconds after that, the door to the bathroom opens and the smoke escapes out through it and edd's dad's is presented with a slight of whiff of ganja smoke that had been trapped in the bathroom for 20 minutes. edd's dad takes one more step into the bathroom where we can all see him, and it turns out he is completely butt ass naked. he walks to the window to open it and clear the smoke while it's still raining extremely hard outside while in a furious tone yelling 'get the fuck out of my house now!'

ed, edd and i got all our shit to go outside at 4 am, but edd's dad told edd to stay and talk to him, so ed and i were walking around the streets of a neighbourhood we don't know at 4am while there's a godly thunderstorm going on and we're both baked out of our minds. some time later edd calls us back in and we blazed in his shed for a few hours and sneaked back in the house and went to sleep, this time without seeing edd's dad's dick.

so a little backstory first , so my mother and me are the only two people in our family who fart the most. we have smelly memories of both of us having farting competitions and we have zero awkwardness if someone farts at the other person *knowingly*. 
we just laugh it off..
so it is my half yearly exam day after tomorrow. we just bought a 40 inch 4k tv a week ago and the guy came to demo it came yesterday and our old 32 inch is gonna go to the master bedroom. 
so he came to install the 40 inch one and went away due to a power shortage (drills not gonna work) but had installed it anyways in time. just that the 32 inch one is now in the bedroom not yet installed, but the tech guy is gonna come tomorrow anyways.

unrelated but good to know info: my longest fart is at 15 seconds..


the fuck-up : fast forward to today..mom informs me that the tech guy is coming in half an hour and that i have to monitor him all the time (welcome to india).. i get up, feeling proud to destroy my lousiness. have a quick round of cs:s and go to have a bath..(this sounds long but please hold on..) so here's the thing , the bathroom in which i bath is joined to the master bedroom.. so here am i, in a shleepish mood..having a bath.. with a tech guy coming. so i am merrily putting on soap when i heard a big noise that resembles godzilla's roar.. thinking that it was my mom moving some furniture, i jokingly said ""moooooooooom, are you farting?...hahahaha"" i think nothing of it for the next 5 minutes and when i get out of there, i see my mom, the tech guy.. knowing that i was in my towel... i dash to my room thinking nothing of it and then i realized what great mistake i have committed...cringing hard as i can, i slowly lie on the floor, half-naked, cringing..

r.i.p me..

all i can say is, my procrastination took the best of me. i told him i had food poisoning and couldn't pack. he said he would give me an extra day. today, i decided i would pack in the morning or later tonight. i ate some raising cane's, even though my boyfriend complained several times that he was sick from it. he had a stomach ache, nothing big. at 12 i started throwing up, then the shitting immersed. i had food poisoning. it lasted until just a few moments ago. karma bit me hard.

input: Text: this actually started a week ago, but the fuck up happened today. a week ago, me and my friend swapped a few consoles, as we were bored with the ones we owned. the one related to the story is i swapped my gamecube for a sega genesis. i play it for a few days, and then put it in a basket full of stuff of mine to be put in my basement for space, and it is set on top of a big stack of boxes.

fast-forward to today, i decide i want to play said sg. i go to retrieve it from the box. i'm short, so i have to stand on a chair to put the basket on the boxes as well as get stuff out of it.

the only chair down there was a spinny chair. i think, ""i've done this lots of times. what could go wrong?"". **it went wrong**. as i reach up, standing almost on my tip-toes, hands on either side of the sg, the chair shifts to one side. this causes me to fall over a little bit, and let go of the sg and lean both hands onto a nearby box to stop my fall. as i do this, i hear something smash on the floor of the basement. i turn around and sure enough, the sega genesis is lying on the floor of the basement, fragments of the sg all over the floor.

did i mention the basement floor is carpeted concrete?

didn't take any photos, and instead called my friend and told him what happened. so i now have to buy a new/used sega genesis, which will be hard considering i don't have a lot of money.

input: Text: myself, like many hundreds of thousands of people, woke very early this morning to do community service for a felony of mine dated from november 2013.

deciding i needed a breath of fresh air, i chose to go work at a children's home instead of the normal sheriff joe special (aka busting your ass landscaping in the arizona sun like a little bitch).

this home has a shop where it sells goods to put money twoards the houses, schools, etc. that it has made for all these kids abandoned by their parents =-\

inside this shop, i was dicking around with a man i met who just got done serving yet another 5 year sentence in florence, and i came across this white soft helmet with a turtle on it.

i instantly laughed loudly, mocked the hat and said ""hey look, the brand is 'long lives' hahaha wtf?""

the man i was doing the cs with said ""that's for kids with skull issues that can't walk around without one. you're an asshole. that's rude.""

in front of a good 10 people at a children's home, i got some very bad looks and felt like a total piece of shit all fucking day.

remember guys, the offensive shit you may joke about with your buddies while passing a blunt is not appropriate all the time, think before you speak! : (

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: if i'm at home, to avoid the nasty feeling of toilet water splashing up on to my buttocks, i will put my hand between my legs and catch my poo as it comes out, then gently just place it in the water. i can then just go and wash my hands straight away, generally without anyone seeing it. yesterday my mum caught me walking from the toilet to the bathroom so i had to quickly stash my dirtied hand in my pocket, which had contained a tissue. there was no issue, mum didn't suspect a thing. i then made my way to the bathroom and washed my hand, got away with the perfect crime.

that is, until dinner. we had a large family gathering around to celebrate my dad getting a promotion. he works at a cheese factory and had moved from the soft cheese division to hard cheese. we were all enjoying a few glasses of wine and some cheese platters that dad had gotten on the cheap and listened intently as he explained the varieties and the process as to how each cheese was made. i remember sitting at the table and had began to ask him about the history of cheddar when my chronic hayfever began to kick in and a great sneeze had began to build in my schnoz. luckily i had armed myself with my trusty tissue and so, mid-question, with the eyes of my entire extended family (my aunt and uncle had even flown over from norway) gazed upon me, i took the tissue from my pocket and blew my nose, wiping up the excess mucous with a gentle wipe across the top of my lip. i had not looked down at the tissue and had completely forgotten about that little incident with mother earlier, and so i placed it back in my pocket and continued on with my inquiry in to cheddar. my mother, who was sitting next to me at the dinner table, then told me that i had something on my face, and proceeded to lick her thumb and rub it off. ""that just made it worse"" she said, taking another fatal lick of her thumb. i'll never forget the expression on her face as her thumb touched her tongue that second time, completely covered in my poo. my uncle sven interjected from across the table - 'what's that smell?' while my mother excused herself from the table to go to the toilet. my dad, who was actually the one who introduced the habit of catching your poo to me, became aware as to what was going on and, being the great man that he is, took the fall for it and claimed he had just dropped an absolute ripper, many laughs were had around the table and i took this opportunity to go to the kitchen and clean myself up, eliminating the smell and throwing the dirty tissue in to the bin. 

i returned to the table, where my dad had now began to explain the role change at work, telling us how different it was going from soft-cheese to hard-cheese and that it's basically a whole new ball game. my mum rejoined the table without a fuss being made and simply smiled as she sat down to her seat.
'you see, soft cheese is basically child's play. the amount of work that goes in to producing a brie is just incomparable to that of a swiss cheese for example'
'ah choo!' my mum had sneezed. she proceeded to nonchalantly pull out a tissue from her pocket and wipe her dripping nose. 
'you've got something on your face my dear' uncle sven exclaimed. 
'let me get it for you' my little sister mia said, licking her thumb and rubbing the blemish that sat above my mum's lip.

input: Text: so this happened about a year ago...
i was on my way back from basketball practice one night when i got to a five way intersection that was really confusing to navigate. long story short, i ended up turning right on a red light and accidentally cutting off a motorcycle. 
well it turns out there was a motorcycle cop right behind me and of course he pulled me over for endangering his fellow motorcyclist. this was my first time ever being pulled over so i was extremely nervous and already on the verge of tears. my first mistake was not noticing that the child lock was on the window and spent way too long trying to get it open before i just opened the door to talk to him. naturally he asked me for my license and registration. well...as it so happens i had just received my license in the mail and had thrown it into my gym bag as i went out the door. well in my panicked rush to get my license out, i didn't realize it got hooked on a pair of my panties...and in my haste i launched them from my bag directly at the cop!
luckily at this point the cop realized i was just a nervous wreck and laughed it off with a warning, but that's probably one of the more embarrassing moments of my life.

input: Text: technically ""yesterday i fucked up"" but whatever.

i went to my dad's dentist's office with him because i didn't have anything better to do. so after a good 2 hours (no joke) of watching some poor excuse for the view and half of a dr. phil show, i remembered that on our way here, we passed a taco bell. when my dad finished his appointment, i suggested that we go to taco bell. reluctantly, he agreed; we split the boss nachos we got and i got a baja blast slushie burrito supreme, (or, like, 2/3 of one because my dad wanted a piece) and a taco, while my dad got 2 tacos.

after chowing down, my dad gets a phonecall from my mom, asking us where we were. my dad told her that we were at taco bell and my brother overheard, so he asked for boss nachos and my mom asked for a burrito supreme.

when we got home, my dad told my brother not to eat them all, alone, to let other people have some, too. i wouldn't be typing this if he listened (i was shitting water hours after eating it too, so this should be about both of us).

he had a test at university the next day, but he watched the gop debate with me instead and suddenly his stomach just started burning up, almost as if from something, spicy...

i asked him if the boss nachos were worth it, jokingly, he said yes.

he went to school today, despite being under attack from the processed mexican food army. godspeed, tacoboy.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so i am a long-time lurker of reddit and just read the posts and was introduced to this through my ex. this is my very first post and thought about how reddit is awesome for tifu and i thought i would share my experience.

first off, i have always been wanting to go to seattle to travel and possibly a new place i can call my home. i am a recent graduate and had finally saved up enough money to go on something i deserved for myself. with it being so hard to come by a good paying job and putting loans on deferment in order to save a bit of money i was able to pay off a lot of my credit card debt and will be done with it before i head off on this trip. then i will be starting on my payments for loans once again...(damn student loans)!

so the beginning...i am looking through flights for the date i want to go and see the price of 267....pretty awesome and just click it. now mind you, i had already been looking at this specific flight for a number of days, nights, weeks. i enter all the information slowly and specifically because i have only ever traveled on a plane once to california. it was scary and i don't like heights...another story for later possibly but not as interesting. 

as i am entering all the data needed for a friend and i, i make sure to check if we need that ""travel insurance"" that they suggest we need in case of change of flight, loss luggage, etc. we decided not to since we were going to only have one carry on so eh. after that was all said and done i enter credit card info and what not and confirming with friend there is no backing out because they would have to pay for whatever and i would be going by myself. the fuck up... i hit submit and it is slowly loading and i am sitting here like wtf! but remember when pages usually say don't press submit more than once or you will get double charged...yeah i remembered not to do that so i saved myself $$$$. it loads and says confirmed. i am overly excited because i have deserved this trip for myself and to see a new place other than mn. i go back check email, print itinerary and all...my eyes wide open like wtf just happened!!! i go back and forth to email and paper wondering what i missed!! i realized i didn't check the time of the flight!! like seriously it was the first one when i checked last night and not this one today. i was texting my friends and people just to complain about my fuck up and everything because it sucks. i am thinking wtf are we supposed to do in seattle at midnight when we get there???!!! no places would be able for us to rent airbnb (first time doing it and seems cheaper than a hotel for 3 days) at that time of night. my friend is trying to stay positive and say we will make the best of it...i am like hell no! i fucked up! i wanted to get there in the am and do activities not get there and go to fucken sleep! i knew i should of paid the extra $$$$$$$ for the travel insurance. finally realizing i can't do much cause now it costs more to change the time of the flight than it would of been for insurance i have to live with my decision of going on vacation and arriving just to go to bed and lose one day of vacation! ridickulous!

 

thanks reddit for this being my first post! 

ps anyone who can help on the situation would be so helpful!! ;) looking at you frequent fliers and/or flying agents.

input: Text: well reddit, tifu while visiting my mom. i was at her house and mentioned a song a lot of you guys probably know called hit the quan. my mom had no idea what i was talking about, so i pulled it up on youtube. we start watching it together (this wasn't the music video, just audio), and about half way through she starts giving me this weird look. i think nothing of it, and we finish the song. she then goes on to talk to me in a very stern voice about how 'she thought she had raised me better than this' and how 'i should be ashamed for being a racist'. to be clear nothing in this song is violent and i'm not a racist person. :(.

input: Text: happened today. also, calm down it was my own baby it's not super exciting.

i have a very active, very beautiful baby almost 9 months now. she's wonderful and i'm incredibly lucky. however, she's teething and she's not the best sleeper lately. 

around about 4am this very day, she decided to give out a rather loud scream. not that unusual but still needs checking out so i hope up out of bed and scurry to her room. i can't see her at this point because it's dark and i'd prefer to keep the light off so she will maybe settle again quickly. usually works well but not today.

this time my dad bod and my dad brain were not in sync at all. somehow in my rush to see what had happened my legs went back to sleep and stopped dead on the spot but the rest of me continued forward. i crashed through a small activity table and further broke my fall by scraping my head on the radiator. i now have a couple of very tender areas on my forehead where the skin used to be.

fortunately my wife heard the loud noise and commotion and after waiting a couple of minutes came to rescue the baby where she was able to notice i was not dead. a happy ending.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so here's what's going on: me and my best friend just left the local gun store because he's on the market for a handgun. he just moved into a new apartment in oklahoma city and wants a way of defending his home. anyway, we had just pulled out of the parking lot of this store and we were heading down this road. (it should be noted that i hadn't been in that area before so i was unfamiliar with the streets) about a minute goes by, we're talking, he rolls down his window to smoke a cigarette, everything's pretty normal. suddenly i have to slam on my brakes because some idiot in a truck was driving towards me on my side of the road. i brought my car to a stop, as did the truck, and truck-dude begins honking and flashing his lights at me. then i see his passenger side window go down and a hand began violently waving at me, as if to say ""get the fuck out of the way."" at this point our cars were face-to-face and about five feet from each other 

""what's this fucking idiot doing!?"" i yelled, at the same moment i could also hear truck-guy yelling since my window was down. me and my friend were both extremely confused.

i then put my car in reverse and started backing up so that we had room to get around each other and when i looked behind me i came to horrendous conclusion, at the same moment as my passenger.

""dude you're driving down the wrong side of the fucking road!"" i heard my friend scream. i looked in front of me and saw dozens of cars begin to stop and congest two lanes as their drivers stared at me in bewilderment.

it was true. i had been driving on the wrong side of a divided highway, into oncoming traffic doing 60mph for at least half a mile. at this point i slammed my car into drive, began screaming like a distressed koala and floored it into a wendy's parking lot that was thankfully only about 15 feet away.

when i brought my car to a halt (behind wendy's, so that no one on the road could see me) i cupped my hands over my face and rested my head against the steering wheel. to my right i could hear the occasional ""dumbass"" and ""you're so stupid"" in between bursts of laughter from my friend.

""we never speak of this"" i told him as i put my car into gear and drove off.

today i was chatting with my friends whilst eating some good chili. i was taking big spoonfuls and enjoying the warmth is brought. it was mushy goodness.

i stuck my spoon down into the chili and raised it to my mouth, mid conversation, not paying attention. i bite down and the chili is everything but mushy. it's crunchy. and moving. and very painful. i spit everything out of my mouth. laying there in the table amidst chewed chili is a crunched up yellow jacket. a yellow jacket had landed in my spoon on the way to my mouth.

then it hit me. my cheek was on fire. the little shit had stung me right before he died. i was gagging and in pain meanwhile everyone is looking at me. i ran to the bathroom to clean my mouth.

after i had gotten cleaned up, i was still shaken and in pain. now i have a fear of eating outside, expecting every bite to have a yellow jacket in it.

now, don't judge me, but my young daughter has school tomorrow. the plan was to put her to bed, have the escort come over, and leave an hour later with my daughter being none the wiser.

around a quarter to nine, i text her back to confirm. she says that she is still getting ready but almost on her way. i give her my address, and her last text is ""sure thing baby! you're doing the vip right.""

and i thought, ""i sure am doing the vip right i.e. correctly."" an hour later, i am exhausted and wondering where the fuck this girl is (one reason i picked her was that she was <2 miles from my house). i text her to cancel saying that i have to get up early tomorrow. and she says that she asked if i wanted the vip and when she didn't get a reply assumed i had fallen asleep.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: after years of pining, i finally got myself a motorcycle. nothing impressive by most standards, but it was my dream bike - a used 2006 ninja 250, black with silver flame detailing. i had never been happier. 
i rode that machine everywhere. on this particular day, i was about to embark on a 1.5hr drive to go see my bestie. i was too broke to afford proper saddlebags, so i was using the bag my helmet came in. it had never been a problem before - usually it was so stuffed with laundry it held itself up away from the exhaust. i intended to stay overnight, so i packed much lighter. some nice shirts, a change of shoes, pj's, etc. it hung much lower and my hasty strap-job made my gut scream in warning. i had a fleeting vision of the bag sliding down and sitting on my exhaust. ""nah,"" i said, those infamous words, ""it will be fine."" i bungeed my chaps to the top of the seat and off i went.  

i flew down the interstate. i don't think i went less than 80 the entire way. i passed everyone - some crazy biker goddess who couldn't be bothered to stop for anything. the wind gets wicked loud when i ride, so i couldn't hear a thing. i distinctly remember seeing this shitty blue truck with four large barrels in the back. i passed by it, like all the others, but little did i know the truck would play a key role in the events to come. 

it felt like at least 10 minutes had passed since i left the truck in my dust. there was a bit of construction just before the exit i needed. i spied a semi just ahead and said ""no fucking way am i getting stuck behind that."" i gunned it, and blew by the semi before the lanes merged to one. wary of a fine, i slowed down to a more rational speed,and that's when i saw it.

smoke. 

""...oh fuck!!!""

i had been going so fast, i didn't see it. it had been in my blind spot for who knows how long. i shut that thing down, hands and feet clamping down on both breaks and the clutch. i'm still amazed at the coordination i had as i leapt off the bike, threw it against the guard rail, and started to tear off the flaming bag of clothing. as i was stomping out flames on the ground and beating at the mangled plastic of my side panels, that semi stopped in the middle of the construction zone and asked if i was okay. i merely hung my head in shame and waved him on. nothing kills your sense of bad-assery like setting yourself on fire. 

all my clothes were lost. my chaps were fine. my side panel was wrecked, my chain guard was messed up pretty bad, and the hannaford bag i had wrapped my clothing in was fused to my exhaust. i could read every letter amid the black, charred evidence of my embarrassment. in all honesty, i didn't care about my clothes. i cared about the hundreds and hundreds of dollars in cosmetic damage i had just done to the thing i loved the most. i was so mad at myself i almost cried. 

that's when that blue truck finally caught up to me. an old guy with a beer belly and santa-claus beard refused to be waved on by me and pulled over. ""i've been trying to catch you!"" he said ""but you're too damn fast!"" all that time. holy shit, how long had i been burning? how many people had tried to get my attention - their beeps and honks drowned out by wind and distance? after seeing i was okay, he helped me dispose of the clothes and pull the bike off the rail. the bike started without incident and with a ""thank you"" i slunk away with my tail between my legs. 

i walked into my friends house in full gear, and just stared at her. ""...where have you been?"" 
""...i was on fire.""
she looks at me a minute and just erupts with laughter. 

gave the interstate a show. fucked up my bike. kids, never ever ignore your gut. bad shit happens.


fun fact: my boyfriend calls me ""ghost rider"".

a bit of backstory: so i'm living it out in portugal because my home country of brazil has gone to shit. portugal is a pretty nice place and has one of the biggest skateparks in all of europe, and to get there i need to ride the train. so basically the story takes place when i was waiting for the train at night to bring me back home. there i am waiting and along the train stop there is a bunch of flat ground so i decided to make the most out of my waiting and practice my tricks... that was my first mistake. when one practices his tricks every so often one might slip out and send your board flying, this can be bad especially at a train station... i think you see where this is going. so i'm doing shuvits, kickflips, and bigspins all through this train station before i see this super hot girl come and sit down next to me presumably also waiting for the train. this girl was obviously checking me out, maybe it was because i was making loud annoying sounds on a piece of wood or maybe it was because i was the only person there...who knows? so i realize that she's looking right at me and this kind of makes me feel pretty nervous and afraid that she wasn't impressed at my mediocre tricks. so i decide to do the first trick that comes to my mind to impress her and hopefully get her number, unfortunately, the first thing i think to try was a hardflip which is a relatively advanced trick. a trick i've never tried or hoped to land, so i grab my board and start pushing into mach speed placing my feet and swiping the board as hard as i can. i didn't land it, instead i sent it flying into a one-way train track. immediately after i start to hear the train buzzer, that's when i realized i fucked up. so i had two choices, let my board break and be safe or risk my life by jumping in front of a moving train to save a wooden board. my dumb ass decided to take the latter, i jump down into the tracks grab my board and see the a bright light heading toward me at the speed and force of a thousand suns. at this point the girl starts screaming at me to get out of the train track cause ya know, i might die. so using strength i didn't know i possessed i grab the coping of the stop and haul my ass off the tracks right as the train was pulling in nearly missing it. me and the girl are both panting and in shock at this point and then she turns to me and starts yelling at me to not do that again before getting on the train and leaving. worst part is i was so shocked i just sat there while the train left and was forced to wait another 20 minutes before i could get another one. what is wrong with me...

 
i fell, sent my skateboard onto the train tracks in front of a moving train, jumped down to get it, nearly got run over, pissed off a hot girl i was trying to impress, and waited 30 minutes to get a train.

it was really cold outside and inside the spa,where i work. i told my manager that i was going to turn on the heat because some of my clients were complaing about how cold is was. i turned the heat on and went about my day,went home,pet the cat,smoked a bowl,had a fap and went to sleep. when i got back to work the next day,everyone was talking about how the fire department was there the night before and how the place almost burned down.

my cell phone is broken at the moment, my manager comes up to me and asks me if i got her text message. apparently at night, they turn the ac up to 78 and go home. she forgot that i turned the heat on and overnight,the place started to smoke and i assume, almost caught fire. i don't know how much this is my fault, since i assume most furnaces can handle a 78 degree setting,maybe it was lint and stuff in the furnace that was smoking. regardless,ill tell my coworkers about it in like a year when we can all laugh about the time i almost jeopardized everyones job at the plaza. go me.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: in advance, i'll apologize for any spelling mistakes that might occur. i've been lurking around a lot on here, and i figured i might as well tell my own story.

like most others, this didn't happen today but took place around 4 years ago. 

at the age of 13 i had found out about the action to be done when there's nothing else to do. i was a horny little shit back then, now that i remember it, and i was always awake doing ""something"". 

i didn't really know how to properly masterbate back then, so my idea of doing it was to hump the shit out of something. i would either do my duty in my bed, or, the worst of the options, in the bathtub.

so there i was, my younger 13 year old self, inflicted with the insomnia of being horny as fuck as i just stare at the ceiling in my room. it was three in the morning, so i decided that since no one was awake, i would go into the bathroom and do my business. 

i turned on the light as i entered and shut the door quietly. the lock on the door is one of those simple ones where you just place the chain into the hole and slide it in, so i lock myself in.

here's where the fuck up truly begins. i had taken off all of my clothes and was going to town on the cold, plastic surface of the bathtub, when i guess i just passed out. after an hour of being in there, my mother had woken up to use the bathroom when she noticed that the door was locked. she apparently checked my room and noticed i wasn't there, so she just broke the door down, thinking of the worst things imaginable.

instead, she breaks the door down with the image of a boy, butt-naked, sleeping with his face pressed into the bathtub. she never told me anything after that, all i know is that 1. i ended up back in my bed the next morning, and 2. i convinced her i was going to take a bath when i passed out.

she probably didn't believe me.

naturally, we take any opportunity to express our physical affection for each other, and today, that just happened to be in the living room of my house. feel free to get your ""don't have sex in a public area"" speeches ready, because i imagine the cleverest among you can see where this is going.

so we're going at it on the couch, and, because we're responsible little things, he pulls out to cum on me.  of course, this is the moment where my mother chooses to walk in the front door. so she gets an exclusive front-row seat of her beloved daughter naked, tits out, legs spread, torso (tits included) freshly covered in cum.

you can guess the rest: she gasps and quickly exits again. i scrabble to grab my clothes and cover myself with them (resulting, of course, in the cum getting all over the clothes) and my boyfriend and i skedaddle into the other room.  we heard mum bustle about in the lounge quickly, then she called to us and said she was heading back out.  she's since come back, but i made sure i was in my room at that point, so i won't see her until the morning.

what the fuck have i done?

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: to understand how i put myself into the position to fu you need to understand the dynamic between my so and i. we drive each other crazy in a good way. neither of us has ever met someone we're so freaking attracted to. we don't even have to try, virtually everything we do turns the other on. it's awesome.

on to what happened... we met for coffee earlier this week and sat in a little corner booth of the shop. soon the place was empty and we were nice and hidden away. my so proceeds to kiss and nibble on my neck. this move drives me wild. every. single. time. so he's kissing my neck and try as i might i can't stop the occasional little moan from escaping my lips. then he pulls back, looks at me and very casually says 'you know there's a disabled bathroom in the mall...'

yup. i am so very keen. this is not like me at all but this guy just takes me to new heights all the time. so we head into the mall proper. the unfortunate thing being that the women's and men's bathroom are on opposite sides of the floor and the disabled bathroom in question was by the women's. cue a covert mission to try and sneak into the bathroom without having my so spotted by some holiday shopping grandma.

hurrah! as luck would have it no one is around and we manage to slip in and close the automatic door. as soon as the door closes we're on each other like horny teens on their first date. in seconds our pants are off and i'm pressed up against the wall as choirs of angels are singing in my head. at one point i notice the red light on the door is still on. you're meant to press the button when the red light is lit to close and lock the door. the door is closed so it must be locked right? i think this is strange but there's no time to ponder as all thoughts of lights and doors disappear as the choir is reaching its crescendo.

crescendo reached, my so and i are staring at each other breathing heavily when suddenly the door opens. my so engages lightening quick reflexes and presses himself against the wall out of sight, his junk in hand. i turn to face the mortified and profusely apologising intruder and hit the close button repeatedly but the damn thing moves as though it's wading through molasses. meanwhile i'm standing in the doorway naked from the waist down giving a group of about 5 women a view of my lady bits. after what seems an age the door finally closes. the red light is still on so i hit the button again... green light. turns out you have to once to close and again to lock.

at this point my so and i are trying to dress while laughing hysterically. we're finally decent and proceed to make as stealthy an exit as possible. as we're walking away he commends himself on his cat-like reflexes and quick thinking. that is until i point out the positioning of the full length mirror. yep, despite his attempts all of those lucky ladies would have had an eyeful of my man's junk in the reflection.

all i can say is thank god the woman didn't open the door 10 seconds earlier.

input: Text: obligitory this didn't happen today but, happened christmas eve but i found out about it today. a little background about me, i am a junior computer science major at a small rural university and have a hard time paying for college.

so my cousins and aunt came in from chicago. so we are all sitting at my grandmother's house just chatting. my aunt gave me $$ for univ bills which i was grateful for. my cousin just got hired as a web designer making $40/hr (which is more than my whole family) and she was talking about how shes such a nerd with computers. she pulls out her macbook pro and was showing it off to me. i looked at the system details, she was using 1 card of 4gb ram.

i then knew that she had no idea about computers and thought that it would be funny to tell her she could download more ram. so she goes to this fake ram download site that i use 1000 times on freshmen computer science majors. i click around on it and it ""downloads"". she says it doesn't show up in her system information. so i keep up the joke and say well restart your computer. she does.

this is where shit starts rolling down hill fast. her computer doesn't boot. i am like oh shit oh shit oh shit i am so fucked. so i lay my hands on her computer and tap on the undercase a little bit and it booted back up. so it worked for the rest of the night.

so they flyback to chicago and it starts acting up again. turns out its lacking integrity in the ram and she says i installed something and i wanted it to crash and i purposely did this. so i go to find out that i now am going to have to pay for a new one when the ram is probably just loose because baghandlers mishandled her macbook.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened yesterday, and it was a pretty shitty situation. so anyways, i invited a girl i really liked along with her friend and her friends boyfriend...and we all took a hike up a mountain in golden, colorado. awesome view, great environment, etc. me and the girl were getting along great and i really felt the vibe! 

well, we get to the top and her friends boyfriend makes a rather awkward noise, kind of like a a really loud mountain goat call: ""aghhhh"" youtube mountain goat yells for a reference..

we all looked at him funny like...what the fuck?!? he laughs and is like ""try it! use all your diaphragm it feels really good and expands your lungs""...so me being the slightly competitive male that i am i attempt to make a call louder than him with full diaphragm support, and boy did i do just that. immediately after, i felt a weird sensation in my stomach and thats when it hit me: i have to shit...like now. 

being super embarrassed, i try to casually carry on but occasionally hint like ""hey lets get back down so we can go to a buffet and munch out (we had been smoking joints the whole hike, it fit)."" well, about a quarter of the way down the mountain, i fessed up. i told them i really had to use the bathroom and if we could hurry that would be greeeeeaat. 

eventually they all pretty much knew what was up. ""dont shit your pants man!!!"" i became really nervous..telling myself over and over to just focus and get to the bottom. i was getting the sweats, as i was making tiny fart noises every 10 steps or so and was praying to god no one was hearing them. 

at some point, i just couldnt anymore. i told them ill just do what i have to do and for them to continue forward. 

heres where it gets worse: not only did i have to take a shit on what was a great date/hike....we're talking about full blown diarrhea and i was probably taking the shit for like 20 minutes. the girl i liked came back looking for me and i could hear her coming back up shouting my name. 

this is where i really panicked. i felt like a genius in the moment that maybe i could get away with using my boxers as ""tp"" and just putting my shorts back over. i wiped the best i could and tossed the shitty boxers off to the side as i proceeded to put my shorts back on. as im pulling my pants up, i hear a weird noise off to the side as if someones choking. 

apparently, i didnt hear how close she had gotten to the area i was shitting and she caught a good wiff of it and immediately started throwing up. i came over to help but she said ""im fine, its fine, just give me a few minutes etc"". 

man o man, i felt so bad the whole drive back; it was an awkward silence amongst a bunch of obvious texts being sent to people about the situation. probably one of the worst days of my life to be honest; i still havnt texted her after last night (the buffet never happened). 

lpt: bring toilet paper on a hike; maybe then you can at least pass it off as a long piss. your date might not throw up either!

input: Text: hello tifu!

first of all, this is my first post in tifu. if i make any mistakes feel free to edit or delete my post.

i'm browsing tifu for a couple of months now and i always wanted to post something, always 

was too lazy though, waiting for something  really extraordinary worth posting...

after  this easter sunday  i  can  tell without  a  doubt  that  what  happened  today was  by  far  the most embarassing situation i have ever been in, and there are some stories i remember.

before i start i need you to know that i have a big and close family, living in different cities in 

germany. this  means,  for  special days like  christmas,  easter,  summer holiday and  so on we 

come together and have a good time. or thats at least how it is supposed to be.

so, i think you know the time when you are awake already but there is no good reason to get up 

and have breakfest. after waking up and cuddling for a while we are sleeping together.

as  it  happens  she  found  some  pair  of  [bunny  ears](https://www.creativecostumes.com.au/wp-
content/uploads/2013/03/white­pink­ears­headband.jpg)  one  can  wear.  she  actually  bought 

them  as  a  present  for  my  little  sister  and  my  little  girl  cousin. stupid  as  i  am,  and  somehow 

reminded to playboy, i tell her how fun it would be to wear those “bunny ears” while having sex 

to celebrate easter appropriate. dont say anything, i know, not my best descision. to fullfill the 

special celebration we try something new. i guess everybody is aware of how bunnys copulate. 

one could say we looked similar. well, whatever. no need for more description.

so there is my girlfriend and me, in my room, having a good time and thinking of nothing bad 

when  suddenly  my  roomdoor  slams  open  and  around  9  people  storm  in,  wishing  me  happy 

easter and yelling hello. 

i will just, for a number of reasons, leave out any details about scene they were able to enjoy, 

all i can remember is how, after estimated 6 years of silence, everybody storms out giggling, 

whispering and slamming the door shut again. 

as i later get told they thought it would be a great idea to come brunching at 9am already, not 

forgetting to wake me up and to greet me friendly.

meanwhile, sinking in shame and under the blanket at the same time, we stop our early morning 

exercise and slowly figure out what to do next.

after showering and 50 failed attempts to open the door we finally dare to get out of my room 

and to sneak into the living room, carefully avoiding every eye contact possible.

waiting  for  something  to  happen  my  uncle  takes  the  chance  to  introduce  himself  to  my 

girlfriend. what a nice guy.

after the breakfest my cousins (3), their boy/girlfriends and us are having a good day. although i

get to hear a lot of jokes, if i enjoyed stroking the bunny, if she likes seeking eggs[*balls*] or if 

she enjoys carrots. [*we are all between 17 and 25, except my sister and my girl cousin*]

the rest of the day was actually alright since every took it with humor. maybe even a bit too 

much. well, at least they had fun.^^

this will probably be brought up everytime i meet them from now on. fml.

 

of my family which doesnt think knocking could be useful, will be hearing easter jokes for the rest 

of my life. did i mention ill have to visit her parents tomorrow for dinner?...

input: Text: this just happened, and it is only by the power of the internet that i have absolved myself.

so i'm at this workbparty and there's a caricature artist. all good fun, everyone is having a laugh. 

one asian guy gets his caricature done and someone makes the witty observation that it looks like velma from *scooby doo*

""jinkies!"" i shouted.

but in a crowded bar, ""jinkies"", it transpires, sounds like something else, something wholly unrelated to *scooby doo* and considerably more racist.

to make matters worse, no one else *weirdly*!recognises the reference, and assumes i am shouting ""chinkies!"" in a club with a moderate number of asian people in. i then have to frantically back up my words with an awkward google session in front of a number of scandalised people, to prove i'm not just firing off racial slurs on a whim.

input: Text: i work at a movie theater. i was cleaning up after a show, sweeping up popcorn and wrappers along with two coworkers. we go row by row, and eventually we're all at the top row. 

now, i happen to be known at work as one of the best huggers. the other best hugger is the other guy sweeping with me. we are each 6' 1"". i'm around 230 pounds, and he's a little more. and conveniently placed between us with no hope of escape is our friend, a 5' 4"" 120 pound girl, just sweeping away. 

we look at each other and both realize our opportunity. so, we close in and bear hug her from both sides. she just kind of casually tells us to stop, but we're friends outside of work and she's used to this kind of messing around. we figure it's fine.

that's when the horrible crack! comes out. she's in tears. we thought we popped a joint, like when you crack your knuckles or back. she was still in pain later so she went to the doctor. turns out we fractured her clavicle. needless to say, we each got a two week suspension and other work privileges revoked for the quarter. 

she seems to be mostly in good spirits now. i think the management is more mad at us than her at this point. still, we're gonna pay her doctor bills and bring her brownies or something.

input: Text: happened yesterday but for reasons to be seen below i didn't get time to post.

so i'm just a senior in high school and prom was just recently held at our school. i have an older friend who has a porsche boxter, and he lets me borrow it to go on dates and stuff because, well shit, it beats my 93' accord. 

my buddy was out of town with his family in las vegas for a business meeting/family vacation. he told me the garage door code and that the keys for the porsche were in the cup holder of the car. as i walk into the garage and open the door to the porsche i realize the keys are not there. i figure i'll find a house key under the welcome mat and  i'll just walk into the house and kind the keys and be on my merry little way. that's where i fucked up.

i do find a key and unlock the house only to hear the sound of the house alarm system beeping. i figure i'm a genius when i use the garage code hoping both codes would be the same. incorrect. this alerts the police as most systems do and within minutes, the cops roll up, guns drawn, while i lean against the porsche in my tux that i've rented for this prom. i put my hands up and explain myself. the cops were pretty cool but in order to follow protocol had to speak to the owner of the home to get his permission. 

they try to call him several times to no avail. voicemail after desperate pleading voicemail. i end up being detained until my buddy calls them. about 3 hours later i'm released and finally get to call my girlfriend who has only been sobbing for the last 3 hours thinking i had bailed on her. 

i did end up going back and getting the porsche, because hey, it's a porsche! i go to her house and get slapped and ended up making it up to her for missing the dance by going to the park and dancing.

today was no different, but i arrived a little early, so i had some time to waste (approx. 10 minutes). it was rather hot, up to 33°c (that's over 91°f for you non-metric folks), so i stayed in my air-conditioned car for the remaining time. while waiting for the bus, i realized that i parked my car in a shadow of a nearby building, so it was currently avoiding direct sunlight. however, i knew that by the time i would get back from the city centre, the shadow would have moved due to earth's rotation, its relative position to the sun, etc., and the car would be hot again. i decided to make use of the remaining few minutes i had and to move the car to the edge of the shadow, so that the car, with the shadow moving over it, avoids the sunlight for as long as possible. as i didn't know which direction i was facing, i had to check in which direction the shadow was moving. i found one spot on the ground and started staring at it. after a short time i felt like i was hypnotizing it, as i realized i wasn't aware of my surroundings and only concentrated on that one spot. finally, after two or three minutes, the shadow moved enough to be confident of its direction. i also noticed a guy walking down the street and giving me weird looks, i was probably concentrating a little bit too much. i didn't really care, as i was glad about how smart i was and that i would keep my car cooler thanks to that. i moved the car to the edge of the shadow and got out, since the bus was supposed to come in one minute. again, i noticed the guy, already standing at the bus stop, looking directly at me with an even weirder, suspicious look. i thought to myself, yeah, it must look strange, to park a car, then stare at a single point for a while and move it to a different place. but, whatever.  
anyway, the bus came, i got on and looked for a place to sit. i found two empty seats right next to each other, i started sitting down simultaneously with somebody else who got on the bus using a different door, i looked at the person - and yeah, it was the guy who was watching me doing the maneuvers with my car the whole time. he noticed me too, and with a worried look on his face he swiftly backed off and went on to find a different seat.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: alright so this was during my softmore year in high school so at the time of this post was about 3 or 4 years ago and here’s a bit of back story.  so this was about 2 weeks before finals, and for the past 4 months i was trying to get in shape. also during this time besides stressing high school finals i was stressing about taking the s.a.t, a.c.t, and a special test that all students in my school have to take in order to pass/graduate high school. during gym class we had a choice between volleyball and basketball. i don't like playing sports so i was fortunate enough to have a nice teacher that gave me and a friend a third option of running out side on the track and field.  so for most of the school year and yes in the rain and windy cold me and my buddy (let’s call him danny) danny would run for 30mins on the track. he was way fit than me and would lap me a lot but i used that as motivation to run better and after 4 months i was able to actually run a mile in under 25 mins and could keep up with danny for at least half of a mile. 
 	
         so back to the 2 weeks before finals. the day was beautiful, the sun was shining, the weather was chilly and perfect for running, and the track and field team left out the hurdle. so previously they have always been out there whenever the track team uses it and for fun danny (and another friend we will call allen) would jump them for fun. but allen would always warn me that since i wasn’t in shape like him to stop jumping the hurdle and we had a few close calls too.  well on that day allen wasn’t there and with a few other people from my gym class, danny, and myself we were having a good time just chilin walking around the track. so near the end of the class period danny jumps a hurdle and clips it and i decide out of stupidity let me try.

         first of there were sevral things wrong with situation beside me wanting to try after clearly seeing danny the more fit one almost fail. first the hurdle i was going to jump was at max height. second when i ran up to it i was thinking yolo and hesitated which made me lose speed. third the hurdle was back-words! finally even thought i was starting to get in shape i was nowhere near the asian level (i’m asian btw so i can be racist to myself) physical statues that probably was required to jump the hurdle. so with an awkward hop and a skip i jumped and caught the hurdle with my right ankle. which is where things get really painful. when i caught it i tried to land on my back not realizing how bad i was hooked on to the hurdle. i landed with my pinky toe touching the back of my calf and a good bit of space spreading my leg and foot apart. after  un hoking my foot of the hurdle and a lot of embarrassment and a long journey to the hospital i found out i broke my  ankle in at least 3to  4 different places cracked it in 6 other places completely dislocated my ankle and a bit of my bone was disintegrated and shredded a lot of muscle. when the doctor looked at my x rays and ankle he even said it was a miracle that i didn’t break any skin. so after 2 very painful and not wanting to talk about detailed surgeries i wound up with 1 credit card size metal plate on the left side of my right ankle, 6 somewhat longer than pen cap size screws in said metal plate and 2 more screws on the right side of my right ankle. besides having the obvious metal inside of body pains from the weather and such, i can walk now but i lost 80% of range of movement in my right ankle, my right foot is almost flat footed, and i can run but it hurts like hell. all because i decided to jump a hurdle with a yolo mind set. i guess the silver lining from this is that i still managed to pass my softmore finals and got to not write an final essay.



b.t.w friend allen will never let me live that down because he did warn me and wasn't there to see it. and i also screwed him over during finals but that's another story from his side.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened last week. where i work there is a section of the building made up of old offices where no-one works anymore and so no one goes into any of the rooms – they are dark and run down and you couldn’t work in there. within one of these rooms there is another room around the back with a view of the car park. you can’t be seen from the corridor and you can lock the door. 

me in my infinite wisdom got really horny one day at work. it felt like my cock was going to explode. i only have a couple months left on my contract with the firm and i’m planning on leaving after so i thought it was a risk worth taking. so i proceed to the far end of the building, and bring a notepad with me to seem less suspicious. i settle down in the room, lock the door, open up my phone and jerk off onto a piece of paper and put it in the bin. i then proceed out of the room and go back to my desk.

so how did i fuck up? 

well, the next day i’m walking in the corridor past the room i did the deed in the previous day, and catch a glimpse of someone working in the room at the far end. it was my boss. turns out my boss goes to that exact same room – not to masturbate, but just to get some peace and quiet. 

the worst thing is that my boss was sitting in the one position that you can’t see when you enter the office – right across the far end behind a cabinet (it’s a big office, maybe 2m long). so there is a very distinct possibility that my boss saw me enter the office he was sat in, go into the room behind it, lock the door, then emerge a minute later.

fuck.

so in the spirit of keeping our promise and liquid confidence i answered the door naked and i regretted it as soon as i realized i recognized the pizza delivery boy. i'm a senior in college and in high school i was a part of this after school tutoring program which tutored elementary students form k-6th grade. this 6th grader, who was probably 11 ish at the time always had a crush on me and he was always shy around me, and i thought he was adorable. 

turns out that adorable kid, who is probably now 16-17 delivers pizza and got the surprise of his life. we both froze, i quickly gave him the money, told him to keep the change and quickly shut the door. my friends thought it was the funniest thing ever, so kaden if you are on reddit, enjoy this tifu.

input: Text: it was the first day of my job. i had high hopes for the new company i was working with after being transfered. at the time i was still a student and it was a part time job in a well known uk supermarket.

 anyway i had decided that because i was only training that it didn't matter that i went on a student pub crawl. i thought i might be a little rough and that i could deal with it sitting in a training room a bit hungover. 

the pub crawl was 12 hours long and i was drunk before it even started. the night was rough and pretty crazy. 

the next thing i remember is waking up at 10am when i needed to be in at 9am. i panicked and climbed out of bed and subsequently threw up.
 i was determined to make it in. i found my way there after getting lost and having to get off the bus to throw up. i arrived about half 11 and apologised profusely said it would never happen again.
 so there i was in this training room with my bottle of water in hand. i had made it. the rest of the morning i seemed to be feeling better.
 then lunchtime came along and i was so hungry and that's when i saw the spaghetti bolognaise in the staff canteen. it was divine and it tasted like the best thing i had ever eaten.

 after lunch i went back to the training room and that's where it went downhill. i felt the hangover sweats hitting me and i knew i was gonna throw up. i kept it in as not to make a fuss but it was building up inside. 

suddenly i leapt up and ran out of the room but only making it as far as the staff locker area. it came out of me in a way which could only be described as an eruption. to this day i still feel for that young woman who witnessed it, her scream will live with me forever. it was everywhere, all over the floors, walls, the toilets and of course me. i hid in a cubicle covered in my own vomit and hoped i would still have a job after it. 

from this point it all got a little hazy with people shouting and laughing. i got immediately sent home after a long telling off. the worst part of it was, they made me clean it up first. 

moral of the story, don't eat spaghetti bolognaise.

input: Text: hello all, this tifu happened a month ago and it's time i let it out. 
well apparently dogs (at least hers) react in the same way a cat does when you beam that laser on any object. dog goes crazy and start licking the wall,shoe,floor,etc..

so i was bored and my gf was in the shower and here i am. dog, me & laser pointer. we're having a blast, going from wall to the floor, doing 360's. i put the laser on the bed where i' m laying and the dog jumps up and starts licking the bed . i call it quits and put the laser down , only to look back and see the dog straight up pissing on the bed....

from all this excitement of the laser pointer , i guess i triggered the pee-here right now reflex. this was no ordinary tinkle. this was the flood gates of the yellow river. i just laid there confused and wide eyed . boom! the dog ran off, leaving a puddle between my legs...  i hear the creak of the water being shut off...

oh hell no... im trying to think of a quick solution. do i own up and explain what happened?? do i clean it? what is life?
 i got this! im slick... i scurried out of bed. brought  the dog in the room, slightly closed the door, went in the kitchen and just waited.. 
the door opens, she goes in and all i hear is something that resembled and angry ""wtf no"" i strolled in (snack in hand) with the oblivious ""what happened""  and looked at the spot i once laid. 

i sure enough did side with my gf in shaming the dog, but as long as she knows it wasn't because of me, i feel better

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i go to a military school, and some of the things that are included in military school are having to dress up and march in parades, my particular school likes to have a parade as often as the superintendent  can come up with an excuse for one, on top of this we have formations where we get into platoons and are accounted for at least three times a day. when we are called to the position of attention everyone yells a dorky phrase. along the same lines when you are dropped (forced to do push-ups) you are supposed to sound off with the number of push-ups you've done, however there is a time and place for everything, and sometimes you shouldn't sound off. the last important background info is that taps goes off at 10:00, which means we go to sleep at 10:00, and reveille goes off at 6:00, so we wake up at 6:00. this means that we can get eight hours of sleep if we fall asleep right at taps and wake up right at reveille.

i got in the habit of making a smart ass remark every time we were supposed to yell our dorky phrase. i didn't whisper, everyone was yelling so i would say it pretty loud, just not loud enough for anyone that matters to hear me.

one friday night, the higher ups decided that we should use our free time to practice for the parade we were going to have the following day. it was bullshit we started at 7:00pm, and we weren't done practicing until 9:45pm. after that we had a uniform inspection, they gave us fifteen minutes to go prepare our uniforms. if you can math proper then you might have realized that this means it's 10:00 time for sleep, but no, we are still up. the uniform inspection lasted another 15 minutes, and i'm pissed now. 

after all of this the csm (important person) gathers us all in a big circle like we're in kindergarten, and begins to give us a speech... i couldn't care less what the csm has to say right now, i just wanted to sleep.  but nonetheless here i am standing there listening to him blab. then i hear him say ""i think tonight went pretty well"" i certainly didn't agree with this statement, however i expected everyone else to give a huah! of affirmation. so i shouted ""oh really!?"" expecting it to get lost in the shouts of the people next to me. 

no one made a sound! i was the only person to yell, now i'm standing at the back of the crowd and everyone turns to look at me. i just called out one of the more important leaders in front of everyone, and he heard me. but mama didn't raise no bitch so when he asked who said it, i raised my hand high and proud. he called me forward in front of everyone and  dropped me while he finished his speech. his wasn't the time or place to sound off while doing push-ups,and i knew this, however i'm an uncontrollable smart ass and i'll be damned if i was going to let anyone kill my spirit. so i shouted louder than him. "" 1! command sergeant major! 2 command sergeant major!"" thats about as far as i got before he shushed me. to this day he takes any chance he can get to fuck me over.

i would like to make it clear that i am not disrespecting anyone that actually served in the military, the people i am disrespecting are high school and college students who have rich parents.

input: Text: hi,

first of all, had some doubts about posting it here. i really could use some sound advice but i've read some of the best advice here, even more then on r/advice

a bit of background info: when i watch porn, i like search for amateur stuff. one ""good"" source are websites prostitutes use to advertise themselves. you can see some nice pics of real amateur girls that way.
i know, it's a bit freaky, but i like it.

so one day i'm browsing facebook and i come across a post of the girlfriend of my girlfriend's sister. she has posted a pic with her aunt, who looks strangely familiar.. i couldn't place her face but some where in the back of my mind it seemed like i met her some where.

fast forward a week or two. my girlfriend has the night shift, i'm home alone and since we're seeing that much of each other during that week, i'm having some private time. again i go looking for some nice ""real amateurs"" (or should i call them pros?). i'm having a good time when i open a page and stare in to the eyes of the aunt i mentioned before.

so, ok my sister in law's girlfriend aunt is a prostitute. since i don't know the woman, i don't really care. i started to get curious and googled around for a bit. i came across a dutch forum, which contains reviews of working girls. being for too nosy for my own good i start reading reviews of (let's call her) ellen. while going through them, i read about ellen's younger friend, sandra. 

sandra's description fits perfectly with that of my sister in law's girlfriend... i search the forum for sandra and find a topic discussing her. (by now fun time was totally over btw, totally covered myself up and all). there's a link to an ad, but it's offline. 

eventually i do the stupiest move and take a pic of sandra of facebook and send it to one of the reviewers. i say i'm interested in her, but can't find an ad anymore. i also mention i got the pic through ellen. the guy believes me and confirms that she the girl he met and payed for sex.

input: Text: this fuck up actually happened today. as you may have noticed this account is new, so you can probably see where this is going.  
  
/u/ramshankle was my first account and the 10th of october would've been my 3rd cake day, but unfortunately i completely forgot that i used the same password for netflix and my ex knows this password.   
  

this all started a few days ago when my previously no-contact ex contacts me out of the blue to talk about some problems she's been having. i'm a little too forgiving so we talk about what she's going through and a few other things. we get on the subject of who we're seeing now and she tells me she's been fooling around with someone that looks just like my roommate and sends a picture of the guy. he really did look like a dark haired version of my roommate (which raised a few questions about our relationship, but that's another story).   
i didn't think too much of it until i realized i'd seen this guy in my facebook newsfeed. i did a little snooping and found out this guy was in a relationship with a girl that went to my high school. so i asked my ex about it and it turns out she already knew!  
  
so knowing what i knew, i spilled the beans to my high school acquaintance and sent adequate proof that they were definitely screwing around. word got back to my ex that i was the one who ruined what she somehow thought was going to be a great relationship with this cheating asshat so she drove to my house and went completely apeshit.  
  
this was all a few days ago and i've since blocked her out of my life again, but that didn't stop her from getting one last shot at me by deleting my reddit account. it was really my own fault for using the same password with netflix and then letting her know this password, but that exchange happened at a more trusting time in our relationship and i honestly didn't think she'd even remember it after all this time. i really don't care about the karma, i just want to view all the stuff i had saved. :/

the moral of the story is - change all of your passwords after a breakup.  especially if you plan on exposing your ex girlfriend's fuck buddy to his girlfriend.

input: Text: for once on this subreddit, this fuck up happened today.
--------------------------
i was sitting at home, hungry, and decided it would be a good idea to make a sandwich. no big deal, right? well i didn't want to wait for the oven to heat up and i didn't want to eat it cold, so i tried something i'd seen in a reddit post a few months ago. i flipped my toaster onto its side and put in each half of the sandwich. after a few seconds, i started smelling something burning. turning around, i see smoke bellowing from the toaster. i have never cleaned my toaster, nor has anyone else that i know of, so it was full of long forgotten crumbs that i hadn't thought of that was now burning in my toaster.

here's where the fuck up really begins -

my toaster doesn't have a cancel button, so i immediately unplugged it and attempted to fish the sandwich halves out with my bare hands, because obviously i wasn't going to be dumb enough to stick a fork in it. i was very careful not to touch the sides, however apparently i wasn't careful enough. my hand grazed the hot part of the toaster and i jerked back, unintentionally taking the toaster with me. as soon as the weight of the toaster was off of the counter, it fell off my hand and plummeted onto my foot. cursing ensued. then i started to feel the pain in my hand. i looked at it, and it looked like i had set my hand down on a grill. between the pain in my hand and the pain in my foot, i said fuck the sandwich and sat on the couch, where i am now typing this post with one hand and no sandwiches.

 


edit - i appreciate people telling me about the fork thing, but in my adrenaline filled brain i just thought that it was a bad idea to stick a fork in a toaster. next time i decide to almost light my toaster on fire i'll be sure to remember a fork is fine in an unplugged toaster.

after a few months in class, a hot red headed fair skinned vixen-like woman joined the class. she was beautiful in a milf-y jessica rabbit kind of way. we get to know each other within the context of the class and i find out a few things about her. first of all, she's married. lives in connecticut. she has six kids. six!!! two from her previous marriage, two from her new husband's previous marriage and two adopted ones. at the same time i find out that she has had her share of plastic surgery done not too long ago. she had a tummy tuck and breast implants. we become friends and decide to do a scene together.

for some reason, every scene she picked involved intimacy between the characters, whether it be straddling, making out or whatever, which i am very uncomfortable doing in front of people and i let her know about it. she decides that we should go for it to take me out of my comfort zone. at this point, who am i to argue?

we get together to rehearse our scene and we are going through lines and we get to the big kiss and i stop myself. she insist that i have to go for it the next time to get comfortable. so the next read through we do, i grab her and give her a very romantic kiss, which lasted about 30 seconds longer than it should have. then we continue rehearsing. as she is getting ready to leave she looks at me and says ""do you want to practice that kiss again?"". not sure what to make of it i say sure. and we start making out. i am thinking this is all an act until she proceeds to grab my dick which was not in the scene. she tells me we should rehearse again tomorrow after class, which was weird because class ends at 11pm.

next day we go to class and then go back to my apartment afterwards to ""rehearse"" which we don't do and decide to have sex instead. it was our first time and she had to have some corrective surgery over one of her tummy tuck scars which was still healing, so we had to be very gentle. this goes on for a week or two until one day she tells me her scar is healed and we can now have sex any way we want.

two things you need to know: i like rough sex. and i had just gotten a new duvet.that's all.

so we go to my room, i turn off the lights and we start having sex. it was fucking fantastic. it's agressive, passionate, sweet and rough at the same time, there's biting, scratching, slapping. it was by far the best sex i'd had in my life. i bend her over and fuck her doggie style very rough until i finish.

after i finish, i get up to get something to drink. i feel all our wetness in the bed. i am so in awe of this woman that i turn on the light so i can see her naked. and that's when i notice that the side of her tummy tuck that had been healing has split open and there is blood everywhere. i literally could see her insides.
i try to play cool, but on the inside i am freaking out. so i am trying to clean the blood from my bed but it is everywhere. she is trying to figure out how to stop the bleeding and close the wound. this shit looked like joran van der sloot's hotel room in peru.

i walk her to the pharmacy to find butterfly stitches or anything that can close this wound. not only that, she had to figure out what to tell her husband. in the end i think she told him that it opened up when a door hit her while boarding a taxi.

i learned my lesson. never have an affair again. i mean, i still had sex with her for one more year, but there was a lesson somewhere.

the worst part is that i slept with the bloody duvet for longer than i care to admit. any time i brought a girl back to my place i had to tell her i spilled coffee in my bed, which always got the same reaction: ""how much coffee were you drinking?""

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: first post, whatever, actually happened today, blah blah.

so to preface, earlier this week it was birthday (17 woohoo!). yesterday i went into town after school to check out some video games. eb games (yes we still have it in nz) have a half price for pre-owned games sale going on, so i pick up mass effect for $8 ($5.44 usd). i played the first level last night, loved it, and went back into town today to grab mass effect 2 and 3 while they where on sale.

so, the fu. i went with my mate (let's call him bob) and he's known for being a bit of an asshole sometimes. while we were browsing the games, i spy a [metal-case limited addition copy of bioshock](http://gameoffer.com/435/bioshock-xbox-360.jpg) on my platform (xbox 360). the thing looks pretty as fuck, so i go over to check it out. i look at the price tag, and lo and behold, they are selling that thing for $8. that is, again, $5.44 for you muricans. i can't believe it, and immediately announce that i'm gonna buy it. i've played bioshock infinite (booker, catch!), and have always wanted to play the others, so this was great for me. bob has played bioshock on pc, and really likes the look of the game as well, he keeps going on about how he want's the game instead, so he can get the achievements and such. he asks to have a quick look at it, and, like a good friend, i give it to him. he immediately says, okay, i'm gonna buy it. 

i get kinda worried, like i know he'll give it back eventually, won't he? he's not *that* much of an asshole. he starts lining up with a eb games gift card he had, conveniently with $8.40 on it. i keep saying ""alright dude, that's not funny anymore, give it back,"" but he continues to refuse saying ""don't worry about it"" and ""it'll be fine bro"". i start saying that if he buys that game, i'm gonna be so angry at him i'm probably gonna stop talking to him for a while. it's happened before where he's been an ass and i've ignored him for a week or two.

so anyway, i start trying to snatch it off him, but he's a lot bigger than me and i don't manage to get it off him. he eventually gets to the front of the line and starts buying the game. i am *livid* at the moment. fully prepared to buy my mass effect games once he's done, and walk out of the store without him. he pays, while i'm behind him, not believing what he's doing. he finishes up paying, turns around, holds the game out to me, and says ""happy birthday"".

i'm so done. i didn't know emotions could possibly change that quickly. i quickly try to say ""thank you"" and ""sorry"" at the same time, since i'm now at the front of the line, and grab the metal-case. i quickly buy my games, then turn around to see him smiling at me. 

cue profuse apologies and immense gratitude. i was, and still am, so sorry that i didn't initially trust him. when he said ""don't worry about it"" and ""it'll be fine bro,"" i should have listened, and trusted him.

but honestly, i would rather have bought the game for myself, since now i have to buy him a gift of equal or greater value for his birthday. at least it's only $8.

bob, thanks man, and sorry.

input: Text: no throwaway, a true man owns his mistakes.

let me preface this by saying that by no means was this shitty situation conceived out of the blue. i am pre-diabetic, and my eating is shit being a poor community college student with a single mom. my diet has been mostly pizza and occasionally mixing it up with dominos chicken parm sandwiches.

today it finally caught up with me.

i booted the computer to double check my schedule for the semester approaching and felt the need to defecate. fair enough, a morning poo should do no harm. however, when i sat on the toilet, i tried to let my colon do it's job.

no such luck.

i felt some serious pressure and decided to push a litte.

nothing.

oh boy.

i begin to panic since i'm home alone, bear in mind all fecal matter is still inside my anus at this point so i attempt to move around the house looking for anything that might help.

fiber, yogurt, prunes, flaxseed, castor oil, anything. i enter full panic mode once the realization that there was nothing to help hits me.

i decided to try and push a little harder. i'm tearing up and my nose is running. i'm giving it everything i've got. to no avail, my fecal matter stays lodged, though now there's liquid seepage.

i categorize my options: sit and pray it passes, or do something proactive.

per the title, i decided to take action.

i wash my hands, then after drying i spit into my index finger. i told myself that it wasn't going to be that hard, considering i've had some sizable bowel movements in the past.

in we go. surprisingly there was little to no resistance, although that could mostly be from trying to shove this monster out. i begin digging at the edges of this blockage and shoveling it out bit by bit.

i did this for around 45 minutes, and i was and am still genuinely scared that such a blockage came to exist. eventually after what felt like an eternity of digging around in my own anus, i could feel the pressure give way as fecal matter passed my rectum and into the toilet.

i sat on the toilet seat and genuinely cried from relief. it felt almost euphoric.

needless to say i've already started looking at a diet and exercise change as these are often prime sources of constipation. going from doing neither of those at all to both of those, at minimum, moderately in my day to day life is a pretty major lifestyle change, but i'll handle it one step at a time.

 

edit: onto, can't spit into your finger.

at this point, it probably would've been smarter to stop for the day and think of a game plan for how to deal with it, but i'd been at this for hours and i wasn't about to drop it now, so i decided ""eh, i could probably just cut through that"". being in a new college house, i don't own a saw, but for whatever reason i have a small hatchet. so, after 3+ hours of tiring digging and hunching over, i take to swinging a small axe at a tree root twice as thick as my arm with absolutely no regard for the consequences. after about two minutes of making absolutely no progress, the hatchet ricochets off the wood and the corner rocks me right in the leg. queue excessive bleeding and several heated minutes of freaking out, followed by a lengthy clinic visit two hours later when my roommate got back from work and could drive me there.

earlier that morning we had been watching some survival show maybe lone survivor. so , we decided to be "" survival men "" and we went into the woods. this is where the fuck up began.

in the show , we had them sterilizing water with a fire, so we tried the same. we went down to the creak and sure enough started a fire , gathered water in a small metal bottle and proceeded to literally burn the bottle thinking it will boil. now , this all went fine and somehow we managed to put the fire out. but it was on the way back where to fuck up happened.

i don't know if it's just me but. as a kid i was a pyromaniac . me and him both. we loved fire so we decided to make a camp fire. a camp fire. in the woods. surrounded by pine needles. and dead trees. so , john started the fire while i was out looking for wood. and , when i come back. the ground is on fire. no , not the "" camp fire "" spot. literally the ground with all the pine needles is on fire and i scream "" what happened"" and he reassures me with "" i have it under control"" . no he didn't , at this point the dead trees were starting to catch on fire so we called the police. the lady asked if it was a wild fire or cause by some one. i looked at him and whispered "" wild fire"" he said "" yeah"" so we went with that. she knew what happened but luckily no charges were pressed or anything like that. in the end 3 acres burned along with an abandoned shack.

i woke up at what i thought was just ten at night. feeling anxious, i took an ambien. what i did not know was that it was in fact five in the morning. this was due to lag on a seven year-old phone i had to reactivate after my brand new iphone fell in the toilet.

i always go for a quick morning run at six. which i got up and did as per my routine.

as i was running, i realized that something about my coordination was not quite right. i turned around on a street i do not normally run on to return to my apartment. at which point, i hit a patch of uneven cement (due to construction) and completely eat shit.

i thought that i was fine, just a couple scrapes. i run to the closest place open at that time of day to clean up. i realize that i am covered in splotches of blood, my shoulder and knee are torn up... and my chin is literally split open.

when i run home to my girlfriend, i wake her up to check out the wound. she becomes alarmed and sends a picture of the gash to her mother, who works in the medical field.

i ended up at the er for stitches.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i work as a software developer for a company whose offices resemble an old, large town house, both inside and out. about 6pm everyday we have some cleaners who come round clean up and then lock up for the night once everyone has gone home. i normally work late monday to thursday so i can get work done without the distractions of people asking you things every 10 mins as well as leave early on friday, but i always left by 7pm so i'm out before the cleaners need to lock up. 

as i work on the top floor i have an arrangement with our regular cleaner where i'll turn the lights off on the stairs before i leave so she knows i've gone and doesn't have to walk up stairs to see if i'm still in. this is where the fuck up begins ...

it's about 18:50 and i start shutting down for the night... close the window, turn the radiator on for the following morning etc. i grab my bag and open the door to the landing. shit me was it dark... like pitch black, couldn't see a thing. i managed to fumble around and find the light switch for the stairwell and headed downstairs without thinking too much of it.

that was until i get to the door... i pulled on the handle and, well, nothing happened. shit! so at this point i start freaking out a bit thinking i've been locked in and i can't get home. i started banging on the door hoping the cleaners would be outside still and might hear me... 10 mins of banging on the door and shouting later it doesn't look like i'm getting out.

this fuck up continued when i came up with my escape plan... being an old house, some of the ground floor offices have massive sash windows that even i could fit through. so i walked into the office and proceeded to open the window. what i failed to notice was that we have magnetic alarms on all the windows... so when i lifted the window the burglar alarm went off.... this literally couldn't get any worse. i decided my best approach would be to close the window behind me and run home, so i'd be off the premises by the time anyone noticed. 

all good... nothing to worry about and the alarm would be thought of as a false alarm...but after a couple of minutes i realised i'd left my keys on my desk upstairs.... i thought it would be at least 15 mins before someone turned up to check out what set off the alarm so i could quickly get back grab my keys and get out before anyone turned up...

well it turns out i was wrong.... i'd made it back downstairs having collected my keys and climbed out the window... just as i was shutting the window behind me.... boom!... i'm tackled to the ground by a policeman... fuck! 

turns out our burglar alarms have a direct response line to the police who respond within 10 minutes should they go off. i spent the next 15 mins in the back of a police van and a further hour in police custody until i could get my boss to come down and vouch for me not being an intruder.... fortunately my boss is a cool guy and seemed more amused than pissed off.

i've just got home. 2.5 hours later than normal....fml

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: the other night i fucked up. a few friends and i went to another city to see a dj we like. this city is just about an hour from where i live and i know a lot of people there, including this girl that i have occasional relations with. i call her up. she's gonna be at the show too. sweet.


we pregame for the show and of course, much alcohol and extracurriculars were involved. by the time we get there, i'm pretty lit, but i keep drinking, etc. throughout the night. i met up with my girl and make plans to stay with her that night. 


we hit up an afterparty and kept getting wasted until early in the morning. i'm pretty hammered at this point but still coherent (i'm not a lightweight). finally end up back at girl's house, do the dirty, then go to sleep. 


now, here's where i fuck up. see, this girl had just moved and it was the first time i'd been to her new place. also, as i said before, i was trashed. i absolutely let loose on this fateful night and it was the most fucked up i had been in a while. so in the middle of the night i get up to take a piss and as i exit the bathroom, i forgot which door was my girl's. no problem. in my inebriated state, i just picked one and went with it. (side note: i'm also completely naked.) i hop in bed with who i think is the girl i was sleeping with before and try to go to sleep, except the girl jumps up and starts absolutely screaming at me. ""who are you? how the fuck did you get in my house? what the fuck?"" etc. at this point, i'm really confused cause it's dark and i still think it's the girl i came home with, so i keep telling her that she knows me and that i came here with her and asking why she is yelling at me. finally after about 5 minutes of this the girl explains that she is my girl's roommate. i look around the room and notice that it's not the room i was in earlier and just sprint out of there stark naked saying ""i'm so so sorry!!"" over and over again. 


i get back in bed with my girl and just go back to sleep until the morning and leave without saying a word about the incident. luckily i didn't see the roommate. i got a text later that day saying ""umm, did you get in my roommate's bed naked last night?"" then had to explain the whole situation. luckily she understands that i was just really fucked up but i bet i scared the absolute shit out of that girl. damn i fucked up. thank god she didn't have a gun.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: okay - so this happened earlier this week. i got off work and on my way home i was feeling a little frisky and decided to text someone who i hooked up with 2 weeks ago. they lived nearby the train station on my way home and said they were home, and told me to come over.

score. i shot a quick text saying i'd be over in 5 minutes.

here is where i fucked up. i decided to go to my hook up's apartment by memory instead of by rechecking the address. they live in an apartment building that sits next to an identical apartment building with the same architectural layout and apartment numbers. 

without checking the building number i walked in through the front door which was conveniently open, and raced up the steps two at a time and made it to - seemingly - my destination.

the door was left graciously open, i guess he was expecting me since i did tell him i would be there in 5 minutes. i welcomed myself into the apartment closed the door behind me and saw that the bedroom door was cracked open down the hall. 

i decided it would be a sexy idea to enter the bedroom in my underwear so i proceeded to kick off my sneakers and pull down my sweatpants to my ankles and call out, ""hey i'm here, coming in.""

as i'm about to lift my first ankle out of my sweatpants, out comes a lady from the bedroom and she gasps and i just stare at her wide eyed as my heart drops into my nutsack.

i forgot to mention - i met this dude on grindr (gay hook up app) and he had mentioned to me that he's married to a woman last time we hooked up.

the first thought that ran across my mind is ""why would he invite me over when his fucking wife is home?!?!?!"" i didn't know what to do, i'm sure i was only standing there for 10 seconds but it felt like an eternity of eye contact. i spit out the words ""sorry i think im in the wrong apartment"" yanked my sweats back up, grabbed my shoes, and ran out the front door, down the stairs and out the apartment building. 

i look down at my phone and see a text asking where i was and his address that stated 22-15. i looked at the apartment building i just left, it read 22-19 and the one beside me read 22-15. i facepalmed myself so hard. moral: ring doorbells and knock on doors before entering people's homes.

my girlfriend and i had a bit of a disagreement yesterday morning, a slight argument, and honestly i don't even remember what it was about. i think it was something about us trying to decide a movie to go see. i don't know, i just remember it was something stupid that we'd usually never fight about because i usually just let her have her way with stuff.

anyway, last night, she went out and about twenty minutes later her best friend comes over to my house acting really pissed. he said she showed up by him crying and saying i was being mean to her and making her feel like shit (when i hadn't said anything mean to her because i feel seriously bad if she even seems upset at me, but whatever), and he starts yelling in my face calling me names, so i tell him to fuck off.

he punches me. i punch him. after 5-10 minutes, we're both laying outside in the lawn, bloody, in and out of consciousness and my neighbor called an ambulance for us.

later at the hospital, just as i'm starting to really wake up and be aware, i notice my girlfriend walking past my ""area"", and i try to call out to her, but my throat was a little sore because i was just waking up. i get up and limp my way over to see her walking into the space next to mine, and say something, so pull the curtain open to see the other side and she's making out with her fucking friend, notices me, says ""you're a fucking piece of shit, look what you did"", and goes right back to kissing him. i think they're making out right now on the other side of the curtain.

i was in love with her, planning on proposing next week.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: obligatory 'this didn't happen today', thanks in part to sub rules on nsfw content. instead, this happened on monday, the 19th.

i was hanging out with my boyfriend (hereby called chase) after he got off work. doing the usual stuff at first- he was all over the internet, i was on reddit reading off bad jokes. at some point i manage to convince chase to crawl beside me into bed for cuddles. i turn around and be his little spoon while we talk. eventually, though, a hand crept up to my chest area. i directed it to a certain lower area and he started rubbing my clit while we kiss. chase pulls his hand out after a bit. i'm on the tail end of my period at this point, so his fingers are a bit bloody, and he excuses himself to the bathroom to rinse his hands. 

and that was when the burning started. in the same area he just finished touching. i didn't think much of it until it began to feel like a (bush) fire and i'm curled into the fetal position. i didn't know what could be caused it- we're both std free, i haven't shaved recently. but then it hits me; when chase comes back, i ask him something:

v: ""...hey, what did you have for lunch?""

c: ""ordered out and got some wings.""

v: ""why didn't you say something!? it burns!!""

i got so upset. not at the fact he ordered wings (health issues and whatnot), but at his choice of sauce. chase likes the hottest stuff they offer, and it's now spicing my clam; all i could do is lay there and grumble until it finally went away a half-hour later.

 

edit: well, this thread blew up overnight- i should've suspected when i got out of work to 200+ upvotes. thanks for all the laughter, tips (in case it happens again), and just generally making my first /r/tifu submission fun!

i would like to say a couple things, addressing some repeat/particular comments: 

* everyone that has brought similar pain to their sensitive areas (genitals or otherwise) has my empathy. i've gotten chili burn a couple different times in my short-ish life, and it hurts so bad, regardless of where and how it got on.

* chase most likely did use napkins to get his hands. i also suspect he washed his hands somewhere, since they weren't visibly stained or gross-looking.

* never heard of 'the league.' this sounding like an episode of the show is a coincidence. 

* i don't know why he likes pizza hut, but i ain't complaining much.

* you guys with the cocktail comments. just..  damn. xd

* and all you punny types can show yourselves out when you're ready.

thanks again, guys. ^^

input: Text: backstory: it was a series of meetings between two teams in a project at my company. i was a member of one of the teams. i usually create all the meetings for the project it's one of my responsibilities for the project. anyway i create the meeting and we talked about who needs to be at the meetings and i was not required it was optional for me. i didn't care the guy was required was more experienced so i didn't take it personally.

fuckup: so we were suppose to have our first meeting but a key member was out so they decided to postpone meeting till next day so i once again had to create meeting but this time since it would be one off postpone they told me to come next day. like most places we split project into mini-parts. the discussion at the meeting was regarding something i was not even working on, but they wanted to include me for some reason in case i need to reschedule again. we get to the meeting i have my laptop and no one else does. everyone is now looking at me to lead the meeting. even though i'm not working on that bit of the project i knew enough to lead meeting.  my manager is in this meeting and my manager never attends any of my meeting cause my manager is looking over a few projects and a big project came up which my manager is putting full effort into which is fair. so i start the meeting with what we are suppose to talk about and a project member from the other team who arrived a few minutes late said something totally off topic. then the next thing i know he is talking to me as if i'm part of this assignment and then next thing i know my manager pulls me to the side gives me a lecture on work ethic and about my role in the assignment which i'm not even a part of and i'm sitting here like wtf just happened. how did a meeting i'm not related to end up with me being blamed for something i'm not even a part of.  i usually focus on every single detail and if needed will work till 7(usually everyone is out by 5.30) just to make sure everything i did is accounted for and is done right. i'm seriously on the verge of quitting. i'm actively looking for jobs but a company event is coming up which is great for networking so i'm kind of stuck till then. once the event is over. good bye. i'll go back to school to do my masters if i need too(i'm 24 single so not too many outside responsibilities)

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so my family and i moved into a new house a couple of months ago and my room ended up in the basement. i don’t mind living in the basement, it’s big and secluded, but the one thing it lacks is a bathroom.

i had some friends over not long after moving in and i shared with them the details of my tragedy of having to climb stairs to go to the bathroom. that’s when one of my friends tells me about this magical thing called a sump drain! 
*mysterious woosh noises*
it’s this magical whole in the ground that takes liquid, and transfers it to the outside world, much like a toilet.

so i began using the sump drain occasionally and all was good for a while, until this past week.

i started noticing my room was starting to have an odd smell to it, but i didn’t think much of it until a week goes by and the smell is only getting worse. that’s when i realize it’s coming from the sump drain. and that’s when i found out sump drains don’t drain unless a certain amount of liquid is in them, so my piss was just sitting in there, unbeknownst to me. 

so i tell my family what happened, and after being hit with various forms of “what the hell were you thinking?!?” some of us head downstairs and start pouring buckets of water in the drain until it drains. all of us are gagging and trying not to pass out. but it’s not over yet. 

after it drained, it left behind a thick layer of scum and other nasty shit on the sides and bottom of the drain. so someone decides to pour in bleach. now i’m not a chemist but i’ve heard that ammonia and bleach may or may not make mustard gas so we may or may not have begun poisoning the house at that point. 

at this point most of the scum’s gone, we all have headaches, and my room smells of faint piss and bleach. no more pissing in the sump drain.

it's also hot as hades, and i don't have an ac in my kitchen, so i'm sweating buckets. moments after putting the peppers in the pan, i forgot i had literally just been chopping them up, and wiped sweat from eye.

it burned so bad i thought i was going to go blind for a moment! luckily, when i called my sister, she didn't laugh at me, and just calmly told me to put milk in it.

now, here's where the lack of forward thinking comes in. usually if you use metho to start a fire, you get a happy little whumpf and the fire is lit. however... metho is a volatile. and although the wood wasn't burning, it was extremely hot from all those fire lighters and failed attempts. so when i leant forward with my lit match, rather than lighting a nice safe pool of liquid metho, and getting a happy little whumpf, what the match met was actually a gaseous fuel-air mix, and i got a kkka-fucking-krummppfo which blew the door off the fire place, blew several now happily burning bits of wood into the room, set the carpet on fire, and took off all the hair on my right arm and the right side of my face. but got the fire lit, so there's that.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: like many tifu, this did not happen today but several years ago.

had a slightly later night on a sunday and woke up feeling not so on top of my game.  one of the vehicles had to go in for maintenance and since it was on the way to work, i thought i'd do a favour and take it myself;  it also had a near empty gas tank.  

being the good chap i thought i was, i decided to put in about 20$ worth of gas.  drove up to the gas bar, and noticed the price was substantially lower than regular.  perception was fu #1.  elated by the good find of a gas bar that was offering gas 20 cents cheaper than all other stations, i was ready to pump (keep in mind, this was during the gas crisis in north america years ago when prices skyrocketed.  it was about $1.47/l cdn at the time).

my next mistake, fu #2, would be missing the very big ""diesel fuel"" sign(s) right in front of my fucking face.

fu #3 was when i noticed a different handle attached to the hose.  still in my groggy/fucked up state, i shrugged it off and attempted to situate the nozle into the gas tank.

fu #4 is where the nozle doesn't go into the gas hole and i promptly again shrugged off this weirdness.  despite the nozzle not fitting into the hole, i decided that something was broken and just held the nozzle up to the gashole and very carefully and slowly pulled the trigger.

fu #5 would be putting $20 worth of diesel into an empty tank despite noticing all of the above.

still not realizing i made a very big and stupid mistake, i went in the store with a giant grin on my face because i saved some decent coin.  went back to the vehicle and it was a very bad start; i just chalked it up to the fact it was -25c and went to work (it's about 2-3 blocks away).  when i pulled into the parking lot, the vehicle sputtered a bit and died; it would not turn over.

again, i shrugged it off and went about my day.  hours later, attempting to start it up and drive off, i was met with resistance again.  asked for some advice and help, and with a little bit of probing i remembered all of those little warning signs i ignored and went to check out my receipt.

diesel fuel.  god damn diesel fuel!

after some embarrasment and harsh words, a jerry can of gasoline was added and the vehicle started.  drove it to the gas bar and filled up properly, noting every little step along my way.

luckily, no damage done.

i will forever be known as ""diesel"" to my friends and social circle.

 
ignored all the warning signs telling me i was using a diesel pump, and ended up filling a gasoline vehicle with diesel.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i took a peek out the window to see who was ringing my doorbell. a man and and woman were waiting there in what seemed to be funeral uniforms. i didn't know them and i was thinking it's probably jehovah witnesses (sorry, not trying to be stereotypical, but it happened a lot in the past week) so i was about to ignore it until i realize i have seen the man talking to my brother before, so it might be someone he knows.

i opened the door. they asked if my brother is home, he wasn't, so they told me to tell him that his friend's brother passed away. 
okay, here's where i have to do a little bit of explaining. my brother (let's call him joe) has a friend (let's call him bob). bob is separated from his father's side of the family, due to some huge fight, so he lives only with his mother, and his brothers live with his father. they don't have any direct communication anymore (even when it comes to family deaths, i guess), so that's why the man at the door told me to tell joe, so joe can tell bob. the man at the door didn't look sad at all, almost happy, which is what confused me. 

joe came home, i told him the news. he was broken, and i felt bad too. he called bob to tell him, i listened to him crying through the phone, even his mom, it was all just terrible. 

so... the next day. bob calls, sounding rather agitated, says he told his relatives and whatnot about his brother's passing, then he starts yellling ""my brother didn't pass away, who the f*** told you that?"", and i told him it a man at the door, he stopped talking and hung up. i was lost, was that guy at the door playing a sick joke? i wish that was the case. after weeks of them trying to find out who told me this, they got nowhere and just dropped it.

about a month later, the same man comes to my door, alone this time. he asks me the same the question, is my brother home, (again, he wasn't), so i tell him he isn't. ""oh, that's fine, just tell him bob's brother *passed by*"" 
passed by. he didn't pass away he passed by. he was referring to himself as bob's brother! he said the same thing last time and i heard passed *away*.

 

edit: sorry about the confusing title, turns out the stranger wasn't really a stranger.

input: Text: so.. this all happened round about 3 weeks ago. i was on a big rowing tour with my whole family, the route went through the freaking nowhere. at one point we had to take the boats out, in order to get in at another inlet point. all of a sudden i got big stomach cramps. i thought letting a little air get out was a good strategy to deal with it. nooooope. i trusted a fart, biggest mistake ever. you know what happened, i don't really need to go into detail. all right, stomach cramps, literally having sht in my pants, i abruptly felt the urge to sht.. ok alright. i was looking for a restroom or a house.. anything.. but there was nothing. only shrubbery and fields as far as the eye can reach. i didn't know what to do. so i asked my uncle for tissues and ran as fast as i could (remember: while having sh*t in my pants) behind some bushes and let it all out. to my advantage the fields (i think it was grain) covered my lower half. so with bushes behind my back, fields in front of me and my family waiting a couple of feets away (but still behind the bushes so they couldn't see me basically) to keep on rowing, i took a huuuge dump. only with tissues and by they way with my life jacket on (didn't have the time to take it off). i took a while and after i came back they, they had to wait around 20 minutes, they all knew what just happened. nobody spoke about it. later at dinner my uncle rolled up the story and told some neighbours (in audience of my whole family, which was there and tried to displace what happened) ""the funny story of his nephew"" and how funny i ran with one's legs apart to him, asking for tissues. i also try to repress it since then, but thought reddit needs to know.

i decided to go get my guitar fixed; now considering i don't have much of a musical life outside my room i like to show it off whenever i can. but today was a nothing day, i wasn't going out, having anyone over, nothing. so we drive to the shop and i'm carrying it without the case so everyone (the girls) can see. i'm taking side glances around and awesomely they're all looking at me, smiling. i feel great. *in walks the fu* i pull open the door for the shop and greated by the usual guy there, but no the usual matter.

""bit tired today are we?"" he asks with a smirk.

i look down at myself and it hits me, congradufuckinglations j you forgot to change out of your pajamas.

i did the only thing reasonable and laughed  it off, no harm done.
oh boyo was i wrong. walking back out past the girls, this time realising what i'm wearing. the girls then begin to fake sleep and act tired and laugh.

it's not a terrible fu but i will no doubt being seeing those girls around and i doubt they'll forget me any time soon

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so it was actually yesterday. this was probably the most embarrassing moment of life. the whole ordeal lasted for about 3 hours.

its a normal saturday, i play in a band so i was cruising to gig, rocking out to some grateful dead. i was actually stoned off my ass (like a 9/10 for all of my /r/trees peeps) which probably had something to do with the fuck up. all of this is besides the point lets skip to the good part.

i finish setting up all my drums and go to the bar to order a beer and a bbq sandwich, when my phone lights up. 

""oh a facebook notification"" i think to myself

it was some dude that i haven't talked to in years and he commented ""wtf gross dude, what is this?"" or something along those lines. 

i was thinking ""wtf"" to myself, and looked at the pictures. 

somehow, in my jeans, while i was setting up my drums, i pocket posted a bunch of weird, dirty, grainy pictures of my girlfriend and i laying on top of each other with my dick poking out. my phone posted dick pics on facebook. 

like the most embarrassing pocket dial of all time, i started sweating and had an immediate panic attack. these were some weird fucking  pictures that got posted to say the least. one picture that got posted was a pic of me sitting on the toilet taking a shit smoking a cigarette. the other ones were even stranger, they were all really murky shots of my gf laying flat on top of me, all of them with my dick just barely poking out. 

it looked like a hotdog stuck between two giant hamburger buns. you can just see the tip. this is not a flattering picture of my penis. my gf joked later about some redemption picks. lol

somehow my phone tagged a shit ton of random people, so that was nice. one guy was a old man neighbor of mine, and he just thought it was funny. he said ""good advertisement for your show man!""

i deleted the post before i saw exactly who got tagged, it could have been family, co workers, who knows. i guess i will find out when i go into work tomorrow. or maybe not.

i thought it was only right to post an apology. this really added to the fuck up. people that didn't even see the original pictures were liking the status, thus drawing even more attention to myself. this was a dumb move. i was high.

some guy that i played with a band with posted a bunch of dick puns like ""not a 'big"" deal"" and ""i can keep your 'little' secret."" 

it was a bad fucking angle man. he only saw the tip. he saw about 1/6 of what i have to offer. all of this is besides the point. i am kind of high right now writing this (6/10)

some other dude was complaining about the overall quality of the pictures, which i thought was pretty funny. one of my other buddies suggested that i post this whole event here. here i am. 

after laughing her ass off, the gf suggested i just take the new status down and put the whole event behind me. pretend like it never happened. thats what i should have done in the first place. i could have wrote it off as ""shit man must have got hacked"" or something. instead i posted a status spreading the news of my fuck up, like a fuck fire. 

oh well. some lady came to my show that night and was all like ""i saw your apology but never got to see the pics ;;;)))"" it adds to the mystique. 

now that i got this out of the way and off my chest, time to think about some redemption pics ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 

 

update: so i went to work today, and only one person made a comment. ( i work at ross) it was a manager and she was totally not offended. i'm facebook friends with a ton of people, mostly ladies, that i work with. i found if very hard to maintain eye contact with anyone fb affiliated.  to clarify a couple things, i left facebook open, which made it easier for fate to take the wheel. another thing would be that i have an iphone, so the new update on fb put my most recently taken pictures right at the top of my newsfeed, ready to be posted. this detail also significantly lowers the chances that i was hacked.  i don't know how randoms got tagged... i believe some malevolent energy (maybe the angry ghost of steve jobs, or the essence of mark zuckerberg) took over my phone. 

lastly... nobody really wants to see those pictures. they are gnarly and totally not not fun to look at. pm me if you don't believe this story. if i get enough, maybe i will post a video on youtube chronicling these misadventures. i can feature my girlfriend or maybe some other people who bared whiteness to this monstrosity of a fuck up. thanks for reading.

input: Text: i can only start by saying that i have been swept up in a nationalistic fury of soccer and was thrilled with the outcome of the u.s. women winning their third world cup- spending weeks dvring the group stages and learning the names and faces of opponents.

 my wife is sick of soccer now (gold cup, anyone?), and is ready for sports to be over. i, being satisfied with a dominant performance by the uswnt, agreed to not watch post-game talk or trophy-hoisting, and agreed that the godfather 2 (just a coincidence-we finished 1 a few days ago) was a good alternative. 

just as i had the movie ready to go, we heard a crash of glass coming from outside. my wife asked if it sounded like it was our kids, who were asleep but tend to make noise if they are ""down for the count."" i thought the crash sounded like it came from outside and said i would investigate. 

...so i did. 

you have to understand that my wife and i live on a busy corner lot and are sociable with our two neighbors: watching out for strange cars, talking about how to grow tomatoes, and why albuquerque cops sometimes have issues. we have no problems  and ask each other to watch our houses when we are out of town. my wife and i are also the under 40 crowd but our neighbors are retired.

so... my wife says she hears loud voices outside and i decide to investigate that crash and subsequent voicing. 

i leave my garage (thinking a car-related incident) and see my two octogenarian neighbors talking about leaves in our adjoining ditch. me, (our enthusiastic hero) being fresh off a big win, asked if they heard anything and they said no.

now ""charles"" is asian and elderly and he and his wife are very sweet and delivered house warming gifts of tea and cookies, which i can only remember as japanese treats. now i see this as a mistake. 

i asked charles and ""byron"" about the noise and voices, and they said they didn't hear anything (hint- they were the talkers) and we proceeded to talk about the awesome finale that just concluded. 

me: what a game! charles, you're japanese,right? 
 

...

charles said he was american. 

...  


he proceeded in telling me he was chinese and that he has been battling racists like me his whole life. just this week he was told that he should ""go back where he came from.""

i was taken aback because i was about to talk about the last two cups and the u.s. and japan teams, but failed to realize the implications. 

seriously,though. i meant it like i am norwegian and german- not nefariously. 

byron told charles not to be a hothead, and i could only choke and stagger at being accused at being called a racist. 

i am a music director and helped create a service opposing racism in light of the charleston massacre. today i was called a racist for remembering a gift of tea and cookies two years after the fact.

input: Text: this happened to my friend about a year ago, anyway, there was a mock middle east peace conference at college and the teacher said to ""dress the part...""; he represented hamas.
next day he walked to school late and skipped first period to make his costume, he made a fake bomb using two pieces of white paper stuffed with black tissue paper folded to look like c4 charges. then, he used duct tape around them in a plus formation. heavy gauge curled copper wire between them to look like a movie style bomb. fm transmitter with lights and a big button that fit in the palm of my had and into a duct tape holster for the detonator.
so he entered the conference dressed as a member of hamas and the debate began. some time into the discussion, israel said all palestines should die. slowly, my friend (lets call him david), unzipped his vest to reveal the bomb. all faces turned towards david in surprise. david calmly replied ""the delegate from hamas kindly requests that israel rescind its remark about palestinians or i'm going to blow you all to hell."" the teacher burst out laughing with the rest of the class left in astonishment.


lunch time soon began and david was queuing for a meal, another college kid commented on his clothing, ""why are you wearing a chick's vest?"". david in reply flashed the bomb. suddenly the kid shouts ""yo he's loaded! he's strapped fam! hes hot hes hot!"".the lunch hall erupts and everyone crowds around david, one person stating ""if that's a real bomb i'm gonna punch you in the face"".


then back in class during a test, the vice principal and principal turn up, ""mr fauth, do you have david taylor?""
""he's taking a test can this wait?"" ""no."" they take david to the office immediately, questioning him ""we've heard the rumours about you?"" ""what rumours?"" ""that's what we're trying to find out."" ""you mean this?"" (unzips vest) ""what is that?"" david then explains about the conference and ""dressing the part"" ""can i see it."" (casually toss fake bomb, vice principal flinches) in the end, david got 1 day of iss for being honest instead of expelling him.

input: Text: so, this happened earlier today, i'm a 17 year old student, and when i get bored i like making poems, i find it quite entertaining and all of my friends love reading them, they even give me topics to write about.  
today as any other day, i was super bored in class, and a class mate gave me the topic ""clitoris full of zits"" (don't know how to say it properly as english is not my native language). i wrote a decent sized poem, my friends read it and laughed their asses off, this was definetely one of my best. when school ended for the day, my mom picked me up to take me home, and i had the poem in my pocket (quite shallow), now this is where the fuck up happens, as i arrive home, i want to share my art with some friends online, but the paper is nowhere to be found, i then assume it probably fell from my pocket in the car, i'm alone at home now, and my mom is using the car at the moment, and i have no idea what to do, this will surely get awkward ;_; .  
i'll make sure to keep you updated if you're interested.  
edit: my mom acted as if she didn't see anything, so i might be safe, i used the card today and didn't find it, i'll ask my friends on monday if any of them has it, when i get it i'll make an update sharing it with you guys.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so recently one of my friends has gotten a border collie puppy. it's a cute mother-fucker, and my so has been dying to see it.

so last night i went to see a movie with my so and afterwards we were going to see my friend and her puppy. and my friend has a few outside cats two of which had kittens a few weeks ago. i think there are around 8 kittens total. they are adorable mother fuckers.

so we roll up to my friends house out in the sticks around 12:15am. i see one of the kittens pouncing on something, and from a distance i thought it was a frog. i go to check it out and it's actually a field mouse. and i know that eating a mouse really wouldn't be bad for the kitten, and it probably does it all the time, but i say to the kitten, ""no. kitten. stop. that's rude.""

and i kind of slide the kitten away from the mouse with my foot. while i'm doing that, the mouse decides to make it's grand escape... up my pant leg.

now i feel this and i'm like, *oh shit. this mouse is scared, and i have a penis. i don't want it biting my penis*

so i take off my shoe and start trying to shake the mouse out of my pants. no luck. so i take off my other shoe and rip off my pants trying to get this fucking mouse out.

it's 12:30 in the morning, 30 degrees out (-1 celsius) and i'm dancing around in the moonlight in my underwear trying to get this field mouse out of my chinos.

after around 10 minutes of trying i finally get it out and now i am scarred for life.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: as the norm seems to be, this did not happen today but happened on nye.

we went out to a club at around 10 o'clock and being the pre-pubescent baby faced teenager that i am, i got bounced from the club. however, i had my id back at the house i was staying at (drunkenly forgot it there) and raced off to find a taxi to take me there and back. unfortunately, it seemed as if every taxi was going in the complete opposite direction or had people in it already. i see one glorious saviour of a taxi heading in the right direction so, naturally, i act like a metal fan in a mosh pit and push and elbow my way through the crush of people milling around the taxi's. although i did not lack motivation, energy, and a certain ruthless desire to get to this taxi, i did lack the basic motor controls that the sober mind is in ample possession of. i followed in the tradition of all my drunken forbears and tripped and fell and bashed my knee pretty hard on the sidewalk. not wanting to be any more embarrassed than i already was, i ignored the pain (duly dulled by drunkenness) and found my taxi, got my id, and then got into the club.

i saw the new year in with a flourish, having a cracking time and seeing the sunrise on the beach. all in all, best night ever 10/10. or so i thought. 

i slept throughout the day, hanging like a little bitch and feeling as tender as the most delicate rose petal. but feeling more like a delicate flower than usual, i decide that something is unarguably wrong. i glance down at my knee and notice that, in my hungover state, satan had injected his fiery seed into my leg. i shit you not, this was the most disgusting puss filled 'roastie' (not sure what other people call a graze in their country). actually, this was not a pathetic, measly 'graze': no, this was a motherfucking gash! that shit was deep down in my knee, angry and red, and oozing. in hindsight i must have landed on a piece of lego because i am unaware of any other man made substance that could have inflicted this damage. and judging by the state of infection, this was not just any of the pedestrian lego you see scattered around clubs: this thing must have been dirtier than that lying whore jenny.

as the earth made its inexorable transition from night to day, i stumbled through the unfamiliar house trying to find my hosts, still slightly drunk and feverish. my friend's brother was there and he is a qualified surgeon. he took one glance at the doorway to hell that had opened in my knee and said i had two choices: either i go to hospital or he cleans this thing out.
obviously i chose the latter, and half expected him to bring out holy water, a bible, and a copy of the exorcism of emily rose (to set the mood of course) for the inevitable vanquishing of the demon in my knee.

he whips out a big box of surgical supplies (this guy had vials of steroids, morphine, scalpels, other complicated sounding medicines, literally could have harvested my kidneys if he wanted to). if willy wonka had been a doctor, this box would have been his chocolate factory. but instead of delicious chocolate or the hope of a better life, he pulls out the single biggest needle i have ever seen. i could see through that shit. holy fuck, i could have watered that garden with that mean-ass motherfucker! he then proceeded to locally anaethetise/anaethesise/anasise?????/whatever the verb form of anesthetic is/ and then used a scalpel to scrape out the decaying flesh.

 


ps: arsenal lost on the day as well, so i had to suffer through typically bad gooner defense with some guy scraping out my leg.

i get in my car, turn up some music, and begin my escapade. 2 minutes into my drive i feel something crawling on my cleavage, it's dark, i look down and can't see much. turn on the overhead light, hai it's a wolf spider. i pull over, get the fuck out of the car and start doing some crazy dance that i'm sure the people driving by assume i'm on something. some guy pulls over to ask if i'm ok, i tell him what's up, he dies laughing. 

go to the grocery store all wigged out, talking to myself because at this point i'm practically nuts. buy my shit, get back to the car, sit down and chill. i'm not a heavy smoker by any means but when i'm pissed off or anxious i'll have one. so i do. 

on my five minute drive back through the **suburbs of chicago**, dude in front of me swerves to avoid a deer, said deer runs in front of my car so i'm trying to get the fuck out of the way without killing any humans. about 10 seconds later same dude swerves again, this time killing a skunk and i get skunk ass right through the vents. 

i get home, drop the groceries on the floor, husband looks up immediately realizes at least part of my story because i'm sure i smell rank. he laughs and says ""karma, bitch"". 

the end.

the fuckup: the whole time i was actually texting my boss, who i had texted this morning to let him know i was running late: it all went down like this: 

me: oh god, 
me: the trash i work with 
boss: what happened  

me: so this black girl is talking, and she uses the word ""mayhem"" in a sentence, and one of my managers, this 40 year old hispanic lady who always dresses like she's in high school,  likes to do coke, fucks guys half her age ect she says ""mayhem, mayhem?? what the hell is that"" 

boss: i dont get it
boss: come over

me: and the black girl is just like ""mayhem"" i it's just a simple word... and the manager lady finally says in spanish ""is that a thing of her colour?"" and i'm like omg learn english you bigot whore, and she asks lacey this other boss our age ""lacey what is mayhem"" and this girl really thinks for a moment and she's like 
""oh! he's the guy from the commercials"" the allstate commercials these are all my superiors -_- 

me: i have to answer to these inbreds everyday 

me: i cant come over :( my gas light is on and i dont have cash until payday. 

boss: no, clock out and come over to my office.


it was only until after he sent that last text that i realized i wasnt texting my friend :(  im kinda shitting bricks right now you guys :((((

update: im still employed!!!!! he said he just needed me to clock out because he didn't want me gossiping on company time... he seemed utterly confused so after i explained, he found my horrible mistake hilarious, and tried to blackmail me into washing his car which i obviously will do without a fuss. he also kept coming by my desk and saying ""those inbreds"" loudly. i'm still super embarrassed but atleast i kept my job :s

seconds later my dad comes up, says hello to the kids, and then immediately yells out, ""there's one of them"". on the ground about three feet to my right was a shrew, scurrying away from us. seeing as the main objective of the day was shrew removal, my instincts took over and i went into kill mode. i caught up to the shrew and gave it a few good stomps.

the shrew was pregnant, and of course the kids had run over to check out the scene. they were greeted with a dead shrew, torn apart with all her little pink babies scattered around her. that mental image will haunt me for a while, but that's not the worst part. i am now referred to as ""baby killer"" by the young kids next door, every time they see me outside. needless to say their mother isn't very happy with me.

then i go to bed, nothing much has happened since dinner. i should mention i'm crashing at my friends house.

cut to yesterday morning, i wake up in hospital with  my friend pissing himself laughing. turns out, the water i had swallowed made me violently cough during the night. my friend had called an ambulance and forcefully made me dislodge the water, even though i didn't wake up.

wife and i at my dad's place for a family party.  someone is passing around ""special brownies"".  i never had one before, so i figured ""why not?"".  my wife suggested i eat half a brownie to start with.

i eat a whole brownie.  30 minutes go by, nothing.  so, i decided to eat another brownie.  my wife said i'll regret that but i don't feel anything.  another 30 minutes go by, nothing.

i go to bathroom a little later, and it instantly hits me like a ton of bricks.  turns out they were very potent brownies, and i was just impatient for its effects to come.  i stumble into my bedroom where my wife set up the bed to take advantage of me (this is around 1 am, party is pretty much over).  instead, i lay in bed laughing, getting more and more tired.

then, i started to feel sick, but i could barely move.  decided to try to sleep it off.  instead, i feel the imminent vomiting so i crawl to the bathroom for the toilet.  too late, the vomit is coming.  instead of vomiting right on the floor, i covered my mouth, and it went absolutely everywhere.  sink, floor, roof, counters, door, laundry hamper, just everywhere.

i ultimately pass out on the toilet for the night, with my wife cleaning up what she can of the bathroom.  if i wasn't married to her already, i definitely would have the next day.  even today, i can find a small stain or two in hard-to-reach areas, such as between the underneath of counters and the floor.

i have not had a brownie since.

but that wasn't good enough for me. that night i didn't believe in draws. there needed to be a winner. so i challenge oscar to eat another. and he accepts. anticlimactically, neither of us felt anything from the second set of ghost peppers. sure it was spicy but it didn't burn in the least. so that seemed like the end of that, and we shook hands and starting eating some pizza. but it wasn't over. the burning in our mouths hadn't died, it had simply moved on into our stomachs. 30 minutes later, oscar and i begin to feel a sharp pain in our guts. meanwhile everyone else there is laughing as they watch us suffer. i try with all my might to push through hoping it'll go away. oscar quietly walks over to the bathroom and vomits everything he had eaten that night. when he finally finishes, he simply announces he feels dizzy and lightheaded and goes home. the pain has dulled for me and i stay to watch a movie. once i get home however, the burn in my gut comes back with a vengeance. i spent the next 2 hours on the toilet switching between crapping what feels like acid and leaning into a bucket trying to vomit (i never actually threw up strangely).

as i'm driving, it's 8pm on friday night mind you, and i start seeing signs that i'm in the ghetto. 
these signs go as follows - 
people milling outside of apartment buildings
cops shining lights in bushes
people sitting on the ground visibly on heroin..

then the worst..
i see a walmart. those are rare in seattle so i know something is amiss. (i'm not from here, very new to the area) 

i'm a female and checking my oil and a girl comes up to me, looks cleanish and normalish. she asks to use my phone, and i let her because i'm a normal person.
she then dials about 10 different numbers trying to get ahold of davonte and then calls his brother and he's calling my phone and it's already turning into a mess, asking who i am, and just trying to get me involved. 

she finally gets a hold of the person who is supposed to be picking her up and during this a middle aged man walks up and she starts screaming at him. 
'stop following me, get away from me' stuff like that, all while holding my phone and walking away. he keeps saying 'do you need a ride? let me give you a ride.'
i think this guy must be a rapist or something so i sit in my car and sort of scope the area and situation before taking off.

they both disappear after she hands my phone back and as i drive out of the shopping center, i see the two and she's still screaming at him, and i hear her calling him dad. 

such a strange experience.

input: Text: yeah this happened monday sorry not sorry. so tuesday and today (wednesday) have been the job fair for my college. cut to monday me in the shower. i want to look sharp so i'm cleaning myself extra well, taking my time shaving, browsing my girlfriends extensive skin care selection as i do from time to time. i find a new loofah which looks like it is designed for deep exfoliation. she's at work so rather than asking i just use it. the loofah is essentially the shower equivalent to the two sided sponge used to do dishes, where one side is soft and one side is brillowy to scrape your oatmeal off your bowl. but like the loofah is some kind of cloth equivalent to that. so i try the soft side to wash my face and i'm scrubbing but the abrasivity is less than that of a normal wash cloth. the rough side looks pretty fucking gnarly but it is in the shower so it must be designed for skin, right? so i flip it over and go to work with the enthusiasm of an autistic lemur after a gallon of mountain dew. feels pretty good, skin starts to tingle so i figure i'm done. finish up my shower and dry off. what's this redness on my towel? climb out and look in the mirror. i have scraped all the skin off of my nose and for head. bleeding pretty profusely. look like redskull. pretty metal but not a good look for the job fair. 
aparently the loofah was intended to scrub the calluses off of people's feet. 
i didn't end up going to the job fair bc 20% of my face is currently in scab form.

anyway, i was standing in my house, downloading some anime onto my phone, and looked up. boom. huge-ass spider on the wall, staring at me. i freak out and drop my phone under a bookcase, then realise it's just a black mark. after cleaning it, because i would be scared by it again, i went to retrieve my phone from under the bookcase, and on top of it... is a huge-ass spider. living in the uk, this spider couldn't do shit to me. i should have just picked spiderbro up and put him outside. but no, obviously, i pick up both phone and spider and hurl them into the fucking wall. they both survived. i made up with the spider. he's called gaz now. gaz is a pretty sweet housemate tbh.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: not today, it happened a fair while ago and facebook reminded me of it.

i was away on holiday with my husband (well, waiting for the plane home), bored and messing around on facebook. a friend who writes for a local 'scene' magazine sent me a link to a martial arts performance. the performance was by a sideshow performer who does everything from nsfw stunts to gymnastics and weapon based martial arts. now, i'm used to her sending me nsfw stuff, and i kind of laser-in on whatever she's telling me to look at. so, i watch the video, think it's awesome, and click around the rest of the site.

my coach is talking to me on facebook. he's one of those people who will send messages off and on throughout the day. i decide that he might like this performance, click back onto a page with the video, and copy the link, and send him:

""this looks awesome! i so want to see it. not sure if it's your thing? ;-)""

paste the link, hit enter.

the winky face was meant to imply ""i know you're more into mixed martial arts, this is super traditional, but look at the athleticism""

facebook slowly starts to render a thumbnail. an obscenely not safe for work thumbnail of a person in latex, with a gag, and nsfw anatomy showing. the caption went something like ""dominate fetish night"" and then ""bdsm and kink festivals in [city]"".

noooo!

i immediately typed ""omg! there is honestly a martial arts related video two thirds of the way down that page. seriously, i'm not being a freak.""

facebook chat went down so i couldn't send that second message, and then i had to board the plane. i was in a cold sweat the whole journey ""we're x hours behind, he checks his messages before he goes to the gym, i won't land in time..."" i had no idea how i thought he'd react, but i knew i'd messed up badly.

when we got off the plane i rushed through baggage claim, etc and made a beeline to a coffee shop. my husband started getting cranky ""why are you so desperate to message [coach]?"". then he saw the message. at least he took it in good humor. all he said was ""you're an idiot.""

by the time i got wifi again, he'd seen the message, and responded with quite possibly the most polite, careful boundary setting ""you're making me uncomfortable"" message i've ever seen, and then stopped responding to messages from me.

i came back to the gym. he was cordial enough. we never spoke of it again. to this day he probably really does think i was inviting him to a fetish night.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so this happened just a few days ago.  

a little background- in the apartment complex i live in, it is predominately populated by middle eastern people, and not all of them are polite.

having said that, one of the things i noticed was my neighbors are incredibly rude when it comes to either 1) holding the door open for you, or 2) minding their p's and q's when you do this for them.

so here's the 'fu'.  my car was parked in the underground garage and i had to go grab something from it.  i get in the elevator and i'm accompanied by 2 of my rude neighbors, a man and his wife, presumably.  we get to the lobby, and we have 2 doors to go through.  at the first door, the gentlemen walks through first, holds the door open just barely enough so he can get through, and lets go of the door.  the lady makes no effort to grab the door, and i quickly reach my hand out to prevent it from hitting her in the shoulder.  after i do this, she makes no acknowledgment of the kind gesture i had made, and continues on her way.

so here's where the gears start grinding in my head, and i quickly come up with an evil little plot to serve this fucking lady a piece of humble pie.

after the first door, there is two other options to get to the garage.  the first is through the front door, where i would go outside and then go downstairs to the garage.  the second is where i walk across the building and enter in the other entrance (our building has two entrances), where i can access the garage through the building.

so, seeing a golden opportunity here, i decide to walk close enough behind the lady so she hears my footsteps and thinks i am behind her, but at the last moment veer off and not use the main door, and use the other entrance to the other side of the building.

and oh boy did this little bitch get hers.  so i essentially ghost her to the door, where her s/o does the same action as before (holds the door, just enough for him) and lets the door go.  the woman, who is fully expecting the white boy behind her to hold the door for her, again, makes no gesture to grab the door, again, and it smacks her right in the shoulder hard as hell this time.  now this isn't one of those lightweight doors that kind of bounces off your body if it bumps you.  i live in an older building and this door was heavy as fuck.  

the door this her and at this point i'm about 3 feet from the door, looking over my shoulder as it does so.  she looks up, completely bewildered that i didn't hold the door open for her, and glares at me like i'm the most disgusting person ever.  she then says something in another language to her s/o, who also turns back to look at me like i had just fucked up.  and oh baby was that feeling so sweet.

 

maybe next time someone is being polite and does a favor for this little bitch she will be a little more appreciative.

input: Text: so, last thursday was quiz-night. me and a few friends gather each thursday for quiz competition at a local cafe. it is very enjoyable and the mood is always great amongst all the teams (yes, we drink beer). the quizmaster (i.e. the person reading the questions and announcing the score) is a smoking hot, really charming and funny girl of approx. 25 years old. i have always made a point of smiling at her, saying 'hi' and making eye contact with her, all in the hope that maybe (someday) i'll get the nerve to ask her out and i can finally stop being alone. 

so, to the night in question. things are going great, the mood is great and i am making small-talk banter with the quizmaster all night. fyi; the team i am on is named ""wasted kitty"" (all the teams have names). now, even though the mood is great, i need to inform you all that my team and me suck at quiz. we seldom beat more than one or two other teams and often end up in last place (or ""the happy place"" as the quizmaster says when she reads the score). we don't mind, we play for the fun of it, not to win. 

when the quiz is over, everyone is packing their stuff and heading home (i ended up chatting with my teammates a while before i left). i get into my car (i only had one beer that night) and start driving home. now, who do i see walking down the street? why, the beautiful quizmaster! so, being in a slightly giddy mood, i slow down, roll down the window and yell out ""wasted kitty forever!"" (we came in last place this night). she laughs, smiles and tell me stop. she approaches the window and asks me ""hi there :) hey, are you by any chance going downtown? i need a ride."". and here is where my brain stop working. instead of smoothly saying ""why, yes, i am most definitely going downtown and you most certainly can have a ride; young lady. hop on in!"" , i blurt out ""nope! i live in the opposite direction. see ya next quiz!"" she says ""oh, okay. see ya."" and i drive off. 5 seconds later i realize the massive fuck up i just did and know that i will curse myself forever. 

this tifu should probably also be in the /r/foreveralone subreddit.

input: Text: we were doing some baking while talking about movies when my partner realized we didn't have enough eggs so she ran out to get some and i got the great idea to reenact one of those cliche movie scenes where someone sits in the dark waiting for someone to return. the plan was to take one of the dining room chairs and move it into the living room area, placing it at an appropriate angle (so that i'd be mostly perpendicular to her when she walked in the door) and then just play with my phone in the darkness until she returned.

i sat there for about 20 minutes before i started giggling on and off. the anticipation was too much for me, and when i finally heard her car pull into the driveway i started giggling uncontrollably the dumbest sounding giggle of my entire life (it was a deep, bassy sound like ""uhuu hu huuu huhuuu"". i tried desperately to quash it, but it wouldn't be suppressed and so that was how she found me. 

in the dark, sitting on a chair from our dining room, facing our couch, giggling like a dullard.

the plan was completely fubar at this point and i wanted desperately to explain that i was just trying to have some fun but at this point all the breath is gone from my lungs and my giggling has turned into a drawn out wheeze. i start seeing stars from the painful strain of my unstoppable laughter, and when i finally manage to gulp some air down, the sudden loss of pressure causes my bowels to move. i start tooting a long stream of very short farts, timed to my ongoing wheezes. 

very wet toots, on a cushioned chair, that i don't own, that comes as part of a set of six chairs. 

i cleaned everything up and she accepted my explanation for my actions, but it's all very fresh so hopefully she can shake the image i granted her. i would hope i could do it if the tables were reversed.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so to begin, this is a fuck up that started on friday - i am only today enjoying the consequences.

on fridays, i only have two classes in the morning. so last friday, i wake up 15 minutes before the first class starts and feel pretty hungry, (no time for breakfast, as always) so i grab a banana and stuff it into my backpack. i should also say at this point that i'm really disorganized and shove all my shit into the same pouch.

i forget about the banana.

fast forward two hours and i'm walking out of my second class. i go home, set my backpack down in the living room, make lunch. now, most of my homework over the weekend is online, so i didn't have to (and so didn't) touch my backpack at all over the weekend.

today, i wake up, grab a bagel, and eat it on the way to class. so now i'm sitting in class. a little bit into the hour i notice a faint smell. the kid next to me clearly noticed it too, as he was all brow-furrowed, sniffing left and right and shit. now, because i'm an asshole, i instantly assume the smell is coming from him.

ten minutes in, the first clicker question comes up (for those of you who don't know, many professors enforce attendance nowadays by asking questions that you answer with these remotes - that you have to buy, of course - called i-clickers). my clicker is in my backpack, so i reach down and open my backpack to get my clicker. at that moment i realized i was an asshole for automatically blaming the smell on the kid next to me. i also, at first, had no idea what was causing the smell.

it smelled a little soupy, a little bit like death, and kinda fruity. fruity...

banana.

fuck.

i reach in to assess the damage. the banana had made its way to the bottom of my backpack, gotten crushed by my stuff, and turned into mush. upon closer inspection, the entire bottom of my backpack was soaked through with banana fluids. because god is cruel, none of my papers, textbooks (reason #125 piratebay is your friend, kids), or other assorted school things were spared. my clicker, thankfully, still worked, despite being half-buried in chucks of dead banana.

moral of the story, eat your damn bananas.

last friday i was preparing the essentials  to spend the weekend at my girlfriend's house. after getting cloths and toiletries packed the last detail was planning what to do with my cat. i have left him home in several occasions utilizing an automated feeder and leaving plenty of treats in hard to reach places. this time we decided that he could join us for the weekend. that meant i had to get his litter box ready. i had just changed the litter but wanted to completely clean it out (i typically employ the scoop and sift). i don't know what he had gotten into but i two days the litter box was producing a stench comparable to what i can only assume an exhumed corpse generates. 
after cleaning the box and replacing the litter i put the scoop into a plastic bag and began loading up the car.

my girlfriend admitted to having a great time with the cat and asked if she could keep him and bring him back today when she visit. i was more than happy to oblige the request. 

we are sitting on the couch now and heard a very strange noise coming from the litter box. it seems that after replacing the litter last friday i put the scooper in a bag then placed it in the box for safe keeping. unfotunately i forgot to remove the scooper and now it is covered in cat nuggets.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: apologies for discussing my life story but things have been going downhill the past few years and basically has turned into a fucking calamity today.

let's just get the past out of the way. i've never been a really outgoing person and always tended to be reserved, but i wouldn't act the same around others and such in say school because i'd rather be seen as the kid who seems criminally insane rather then the kid who probably slits his wrists when he goes home.

ever since middle school, i have progressively continued to become more of a untamed psychopath in school however i'd become more depressed when i would return home, and it even continues to this day, (being a senior in high school). i had one good friend though in middle school however and was like a brother to me considering i haven't had a father since i was a little kid and i was being raised by my single mom and i had two sisters, so having a friend i can relate to really helped me.

however, come freshman year, i learned quickly how things change. my friend found a relationship, and i respected that. he told me that he still trusted me more than his girlfriend and such, but i wanted to be a good friend and told him to do whatever it takes to make her happy, even if it means not hanging out with me anymore or such, and that is exactly what happened.

at the time i didn't see it as self sacrifice and saw it as a opportunity to return the favor to my best friend whom always gave me advice and motivated me to do what i love to do (which is make films/videos, study computers and play video games lol.) however i didn't realize how hard things would be when you lose your best friend. we honestly hardly ever talked and if we did, things would always end in a argument and on bad terms.

this led to a void in my life that i knew existed, but however (and not to sound all philosophical and corny), but it felt as if my brain and it's logic was fighting my heart and it's fantasies that it would conjure up. i would hope that one day i'd have a friendship that would actually last. this is something that has been toxic throughout the past four years of my life and still plagues me even to today.

i began to make myself an outcast at school, just going to school and coming home. i wouldn't speak to anybody, even my family and would just play video games to hide from the ""shittiness"" of reality. i met a girl... and long story short i fell in love with her, and was happily met with the prospect that she had the same feelings for me that i had for her. however, things got bad, and not because either of us did anything wrong, i just noticed how depressed she was because we were so young and couldn't meet each other for a while. so idiotically, i let her go on her own terms so she could find someone else in the real world instead of clinging to skype calls and text. i made her hate me so she would break up with me. and the bandage covering that void came off and it just continued to grow.

fast forward to now, there is a girl who i have known since freshman year and our ""interaction"" was confusing to say the least. we hated eachother, yet we had many mutual friends, so we had to learn to tolerate eachother. but as time went on, i began to actually like her when i got to know her, but kept things to myself as to not start any drama.

i have another friend now who i talk to all the time, (well i talk to him all the time but he has other friends too so he responds when he can), and he is cousins with this girl whom i hated and tolerated. 

senior year, (being this year), i was in the worst mental shape ever, and basically at this point i don't even know who i am anymore. i don't know what i like and i lost the passion for everything i once loved to do. the void in my life at this point was about to consume me, however something ridiculous entered my mind and has plagued me. i thought i liked my friend's cousin. i literally made a list stating what made me like her and i made another list countering my fantasy with logic as to why the whole idea of myself liking her was fucked up.

in the end, i thought i might as well talk to her about it (which is how i fucked up today). so i spoke to her about myself having ""feelings"" for her, and that i couldn't explain why. i just didn't want to lie right in front of her. 

her reaction was what i expected. she had a freak fit, going to her friends and telling them exactly what i said (which came from the heart) and her hatred for me grew probably as large as the void that surrounds me.

now i have to face the prospect of being a laughing stock. i honestly never want to have the guts to do anything ballsy ever again. i honestly don't plan on going to prom and i won't walk during graduation. i'll just receive my diploma in the mail and spare those around me.

input: Text: when i take a dump i always have some toilet paper in my hand folded up, or sitting on my leg, or the ledge of the bathtub.   

my wife always walks in on me when i'm in there, and over the years i've developed this strange joke thing where i'll stuff the toilet paper into my mouth when she walks in. i don't know why i do it, but she laughed at it years ago so i've just kept it up. the toilet paper is always clean when i do that.  

she never walks in when i'm wiping, and if she does, i would hear here coming and not wipe while she's there, i could never bring myself to wipe in front of her for some reason. 

well, tonight i was wiping, and of course i looked at what i wiped, and the door swung open. i didn't miss a beat, i stuffed the shit covered toilet paper right into my mouth. this wasn't a 3rd-5th wipe buildup, this was number 1, the very first wipe, the one with the most shit per square inch. this wasn't a normally formed shit either, it was runny, chunky, loose, and for fucks sake it smelled horrid. 

as soon as it touched my tongue, i gagged, i gagged worse then i've ever gagged before. then i puked. 

all the while my wife is just standing there laughing hysterically, practically peeing her pants. thankfully the kids were down in the basement, i didn't want them hearing or seeing what just happened. 

i calmed down, she calmed down, she left the washroom. i got up and rinsed my mouth out several times, brushed my teeth, and used several mouthfuls of scope, all the while my ass is covered in shit and there's puke on the floor. i threw the toothbrush away, finished wiping then i cleaned up the puke. 

never again.

fast forward a month or so and i end up in the er. i had no medical insurance at the time so i got a bill for almost 4000 dollars. i called and talked to someone about getting it reduced to a more manageable amount and i was told they would be doing something about it. after that i never received another call or called back (which was my fault)
i ended up back in the er a couple more times before i managed to get insurance. afterwards everything went fine and the insurance covered me. 
last week i received a letter from a collections agency and i find out i have almost 10,000 dollars in medical debt. i have been told that there is nothing i can do to reduce it (except for a 25 percent reduction that i would have to go to court for and may end up costing me more than what i would get taken off) 

so now i am working a minimum wage part time job, living on my own for the first time with a room mate and i barely make 700 in a single month. after i pay all my bills i have maybe 20-50 dollars extra and now that will be gone too.  i'm scared. i'm broke and i don't know what to do.. please don't make the same mistake i did.

i placed an ad to do a car trade, nothing fancy just a change. a guy came out, viewed and decided to take the offer. a day later, since my wife (julie) was heavily pregnant and still having cravings i decided to pop out for some of her cravings (strawberries dipped in the powdered chicken stock for those who must know). i got some weird stares buying both of these together, and that's when i received a call from julie's mobile, it was actually my mother in law saying they're heading to the hospital as her waters have broke.

 in a rush i ran out, not remembering where i parked, i frantically run around the car park and praise the lord i spot it parked a couple of rows down. i tried the key, tried the door & then tried the passenger side. i screamed ""why won't you open!"" being this our first baby i didn't want to miss a thing, i wrapped my jumper round my hand and smashed the window. jumping in i try to start the car, shaking like crazy thinking i was going to miss one of the best moments in my life. suddenly the realisation hit me, oh god no, i had just broke in to my old fucking car. sheepishly i ran to the cash machine and left money in the compartment and a poorly drawn note on the back of a receipt, because leaving would just be a dick move. 

once i found my new car i did get to the hospital in time and julie went on to have a beautiful baby girl, which made up for the whole fuck up of the day, and leaving myself skint until payday. i didn't tell the guy it was me, have seen him driving around and he gives me a wave now and again, i give a little wave back but i can't face to look him in the eyes. 

sorry for the format, first time posting and being on a mobile really doesn't help. 

ps mark, if you reddit this was a lie. i did not break into your car.

that didnt happen, i woke up at my normal time which would be fine but my old step dad needed to stop by and  pick something up. he then proceeded to talk for 20minutes about hit life and venting. i knew i was running low on time but i figured he has had a hard time and i should listen and maintain a positive relationship with him. 

flashforward to 40minutes until class. i get in my car and get ready to start it and it doesnt start because i left something plugged into the cigarette lighter, fuck! ""not fucking today!"" i scream as i continue to try and finally it starts. 
 
i set my gps to take me to home depot and i finally get there, wait for somebody to show me where everything is and cut it to the right size. i get back to my car at 10:00. class has started and im late. thats okay at least ill be prepared. 

i enter the college into my gps because i dont know the area. i decided to take a guess and turn down a road while my gps loaded. i drice for 5 minutes before it finally finds my location; i went the wrong way. i turn around and head to class. by the time i find parking and walk to class im 30 minutes late. i sit down and talk to the person behind me to see whats going on. his response?

anyways, i manage to get 2 hours of sleep before i hear one of my housemates come in. i manage to get back to sleep for another hour to an hour an half. that's when i hear the pounding scream of satan himself. the fire alarm was ringing whilst water coming from upstairs ran through it, as well the nearby light bulbs in the ceiling. 

here's a snapchat i took of the situation:

http://youtu.be/fytxxzhl1ew

i went upstairs to check what the fuss was about. turns out my housemate had fell asleep in the bath, causing it to overflow and seep through the floor.

the ringing and pouring water lasted about 3-4 hours before the water cleared up and we found a screwdriver to remove the battery from the alarm. the police also came and left straight away since the ringing stopped for an interval of 15 minutes.

here's some pictures of the aftermath:

i called anthony at paypal - ""i really fucked up""  anthony took pitty and it looks like i won't be getting screwed after all.  he explained that i was protected from scams and put a claim in.  i won't be getting charged.  i did learn a valuable lesson.  research that shit, before you push that button!!

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i've been sitting on this one for awhile because it's just so damn embarrassing. for context, i was teaching first grade and was still kind of a rookie. that still doesn't excuse me though, because i absolutely should have known better. also i'm a male, which becomes relevant later on.


it was mother's day, and i had this brilliant idea to have my students write letters/cards of appreciation for their moms. i figured it would be a nice little surprise they could bring home. sadly, we all got so much more than we bargained for.


i sit down in the classroom to check my email that morning before the kids arrive and chug my coffee like an amish kid at spring break. my caffeine fix hasn't quite hit me yet, so i'm a little grumpy and thinking to myself how those ungrateful little narcissists will probably complain about my daily writing assignment, despite all that their long-suffering mothers do for them.


i'm trying to think of a way to help my students get some ideas about what to write for their mothers, when i get this brilliant plan to look for a mr. rogers video. surely, i thought, he must have addressed the topic of mothers at some point in his long-running television show.


i pull up a few tabs and start searching away on youtube and pbs, but i'm relieved to see a promising hit pop up at the top of my youtube search. before i bookmark the video though, i decided to preview it, because who knows what some sick bastard might try to sneak in the middle of an innocent mr. rogers clip about mother's day. 


so i watch this short clip and it seems pretty vanilla, you know, the usual mr. rogers stuff--kinda boring, but kinda soothing at the same time (just like mom). about halfway through i'm about to fall asleep when someone pops in to ask me a question or give me some paperwork to do. i go back to the video and mr. rogers is talking to his bff the train and wrapping up the episode. alright, the clip looks good so i'll just cue it up and get ready for the rest of my day.


fast-forward to writing time. i unveil my brilliant assignment and we talk about mother's day, etc. some kid talks about how his dad helps him make breakfast for his mom, another kid says her mom is beautiful. i tell everyone to shut up and start the video.


i'm watching and everyone is watching and mr. rogers says something about how one of the things that makes mothers special is how they give their babies milk. wtf mr. rogers, i don't remember that but whatever, it's true life deal with it. then mr. rogers shows some cute baby animals, just like i remember. the kids are losing their shit, these baby animals are the best. hell yeah, best teacher ever! thanks, mister rogers!


then i notice that every time mister rogers shows us some baby animals, they always start nursing. that's cool, it's biology, that's life, it's what mothers do. some of the kids are getting a little squirmy, and i just say hey, it's all right, it's how mothers take care of their babies and it's one thing that makes them special--there's nothing wrong with it! the squirmy kids seem ok with that and the video keeps going.


then mr. rogers shows us a human mother holding her baby, except this morning i didn't notice that she was nursing too. some kids giggle, one kid gasps. whatever, it's a mom, who cares? cut to another clip revealing a full-view shot of her nipple. that's right, her nipple.


now, i think it's fair to say we were all a little shocked at this point. i don't have any problem with the god-given right for a woman to breastfeed her child, and there is absolutely nothing wrong or dirty about it whatsoever. that being said, i was not entirely prepared for clip after clip after clip of biv (breastfeeding infant view), including nsfw nipple shots. 


mr. rogers was not just showing these mothers in action, he was showing their nips all. the. time. i didn't know what to do--if i shut down the video, every kid in my class would get the impression that this was somehow wrong or bad. but as the video kept going, the kids' responses became more and more exaggerated, and to be honest, i was already shocked as hell at what we had seen so far, i was afraid of what would come next!


well reddit friends, i hope you don't judge me, but i am proud to say that i stayed the course. keep in mind, this video is projecting on a larger-than-life, ~80"" screen, putting my entire class face-to-face with mother nature. at one point, i did pause the video, threatening to turn it off if my students didn't quiet down, to which about half the class countered that this would be an acceptable arrangement. fortunately, mr. rogers had to feed his fish so he turned off the boob tube and i breathed a sigh of relieve, drafting my letter of resignation in my head.


after the video, i decided that the best course of action given what just took place would be to have a quick discussion, so i asked my students to share some of their reactions. some were quite humorous, others were interesting or even insightful. as it turned out, only about 1/3 were outright appalled, while another third said it was no big deal and that they should just get over it (that was my reaction too), and the remaining third was just spacing out and had no idea what was going on. 


ultimately, we came to a class agreement that while it may be unusual for some people who haven't seen it before, breastfeeding was indeed a way for mothers to care for their babies, and another thing that made them special; since it is part of life, there is nothing gross or wrong about it, even if it makes some people uncomfortable to see. i apologized to those who were offended, and several students came to my defense yet again.


 

and for all the sickos out there, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmazpwvdon0) the video in question.

input: Text: tifu by sleeping in.  last night, i set my alarm for 8:30am, so i can wake up in time for a flight to seattle that leaves around 10. i only live about 15 minutes from it, and i was only doing a mileage run, so i really wasn't concerned about getting to the airport extra early.  so my alarm goes off, i look at my phone, and google has an alert saying that the plane is delayed 50 minutes.  great! i can sleep in a bit more.  so i do, get back up at 915, turn on the tv for a few minutes, then look at my phone again, see that it's no longer delay.  i jump out of bed, get dressed, only have time to eat a banana, hop on my bike and race to the airport.  of course, when i get there, i have a hard time finding parking because all of the bike spots are taken, so i start to panic even more.  eventually finding a spot, i power walk into the terminal, can't get my ticket printed at the kiosk, so have to go to an agent.  he tells me i can still make it if i run, so i do.  

by the time i get to the gate, they are on the last call, excited to have made it, show the boarding agent my ticket and get on.  to my surprise, only 7 other people are on the plane.  i take my seat and before closing the door, the flight attendants offer the 3 of us in coach to sit in first class.  as we are pushing back, my stomach starts to cramp up, it hit me that i wasn't able to take my normal morning poop.  i'm squirming a bit in the chair, trying to play it off like i just can't get comfortable, hoping it would just pass.  i feel a fart coming on, so i bend over like i'm reaching into the seat pocket, letting one slide out.  unfortunately, a bit of shit came along with it. so there i am, stomach cramping, sitting in a shart, which smells of baby diapers, nothing i can do about it, till we get off the ground.  

the captain comes over the pa and lets us know we are third in line and should be taking off in about 7 minutes.  i toss an turn the entire time, eyes watering from the pain, smelling that awful smell, the nice lady beside me notices, and asks if something is wrong.  i just tell her, i didn't sleep well, my back was hurting.  so we are now off the ground and i'm waiting for the 10,000 foot ding, to let me know i can jump up.  patient waiting, have my eyes set on that bathroom door, hear the ding, reach down to unbuckle, and before i can get it off, the guy, 2 seats in front of me, is up and walking, almost like a ninja.  with a brisk pace, i walk up to the front and ask the flight attendant if i can use the bathroom in coach since this one was in use.  she just smiles and says sure.  racing to the back, finally on the toilet, relief strikes, and figure my day will be good.  

look down and of course, it was a pretty bad shart, my briefs are just covered.  i take them off and throw them in the trash can, while i finish my poop. all finished now, i stand up, clean off my butt, flush the toilet, and realize, the cow pie i just left, wasn't going down.  i again start to panic, because they fa's will know it was me because i was the only back there.  i wad up a grip load of toilet paper, soak it in the sick, throw it on top of it, to try to get it to flush and it of course does nothing, just wooshs down, finally giving up, i wash my hands and head back to my seat.  the rest of the flight was unproductive. when land in seattle, deplaned, said bye to the fa's.  

now since this was just a mileage run, i was only staying in seattle for 50 minutes, then heading back home.  of course it's on the same airplane, but i figured it would be packed on the way back, and i could hide in my seat.  got some food, since i missed breakfast, then they started boarding.  as i'm getting on the plane, the same fa that said i could use the rear bathrooms, sees me, and says ""welcome back, next time, just ask us for a bowl cleaner."" i of course, hung my head in shame, took my seat and, didn't get up till it was time for me to sneak off the plane.

 
woke up late, couldn't do my morning routine, nearly missed a flight, shit my pants on the plane, left a massive cow pie in the toilet, and a flight attendant called me out on it.

input: Text: (this happened about a month ago) so i got this great idea of trying to cook a dinner for my girlfriend since she does all the cooking. i found a recipe that sounded good and went to the store to get everything. i was going to try and cook steak in a pan (we live in apartment that won't allow a grill, which i know how to cook on, not a pan). i knew cooking with oil could cause a fire but since i've never cooked with it before i had no idea how. the recipe was very vague on the process. my interpretation of what it said was to heat the pan up then apply the oil which is where i fucked up. i turned the heat onto high and once then pan heated up i applied the oil. within a second the whole pan was on fire. my first reaction was to sprint to the couch and grab the blanket to cover it and cut off the oxygen to the fire (the one thing i did know was water will make it 10x worse). the blanket put the flames out but was pouring smoke out everywhere filling our apartment. i grabbed the pan with an oven mitt and put it outside. after cleaning everything up and trying everything i could to get the smell out my girlfriend informed me that all i needed to do was cover it with another pan and that i was not allowed to cook again (she was taking a nap till the fire alarms were going off). my after thoughts of the situation was maybe i should have taken a cooking class in high school or my first year of living on college campus.

my family loved to try eating out somewhere new every couple of weeks just to see if they were any good and that day we were heading towards the waffle house. we had all heard the stories of waffle house being a mecca for rednecks so we decided to give it a go because that stereotype was honestly a bit unfair. til we got inside.

in the dimly lit diner there was but one old man reading a paper and drinking coffee and a young waitress about 19-24 at most. she greeted us and asked us for our choices after handing us our menu's. i noticed there was all the essential cooking apparatuses behind her and i was wondering ""where the hell is the cook""? turns out at the wafflehouse the waitress both takes and fills your order.

so as she began to cook our food she began to tell us a story. a story about how her boyfriend is a bit of a ""loser"" for about 10 minutes and how her lifes a bit of a wreck. this lasted far too long. i just wanted my goddamn hashbrowns. then she gets into a tale about how shes 3 months pregnant..

she looks very well kept for 3 months pregnant. washboard stomach and the works. i knew several women who were pregnant and i saw each one by month three have a baby bump. not much but there is little way they could have a washboard stomach and be 3 months in.

this irked me.

here i am sitting in a diner watching and listening to a girl who was cooking my hashbrowns in front of us talking about her lifes story and why it's shit while i look to my left and notice a tip jar.

i am irritated. i am hungry. i want my goddamn hashbrowns. and i want to leave.

so then she says how her boyfriend who is ""such a loser"" wont pay for the abortion for the 3 month old ""baby"" she is harboring and that she is too poor to afford it herself and she doesn't have medicare.

my internet mindset ripped through my weakened barriers of self restraint like wet paper trying to hold back a mad wolverine with assistance from my slowly compounding irritation.

""have you tried falling down some stairs"" i said. the room turned into a vacuum of sound. my family looked upon me with horror as if i was carnally feasting on the infant itself. not saying they didn't think it. i am their child and we share similar levels of tolerance. but they have far greater restraint than i. 

she turned around and asked ""what did you say?"". my dad who is a somewhat master of diffusing situations since he did nothing but manage people for the past 20 years fabricated an excuse for about 5 minutes and having me apologize.

i knew had we not been in vision of her cooking our food it would be garnished with a few ml's of spit. thankfully she was cooking in front of us. my parents left a charitable tip and left.

when we got to the car every single one of them. brother, mother, and father burst into a roaring laughter. i am their child after all. their thoughts were echoed by my own.

but it sure as shit made eating that meal more awkward let alone for the rest of the time she really didn't talk about herself again.

 

for those curious http://www.yelp.com/biz/waffle-house-blue-springs that is the one i went to several years ago.

go ahead and read the reviews for yourselves.

so i was staying my friend's (let's call him sam) house for a night with a group of friends. sam's parents weren't home, and we had a good time. being a group of teenagers, us boys were making sexist jokes all night, shouting at the girls to go to the kitchen and stuff like that. i know it's lame and chauvinistic, but most teenage jokes are.

so anyway, come morning, i'm woken up in the living room by a female voice. thinking that it's a friend of mine, i carry on with the shitty humour from the previous night, and yell ""get in the god damn corner woman!"" with a loud angry voice. to my surprise, i heard no answer. instead, one of my friends came over and told me i'd just been yelling at sam's mum, who i'd never spoken with before. needless to say, i stayed out of her sight that day... 

to this day, i think those are the only words i have ever spoken to her.

the driver was sitting back reclined on the phone. he sat up when he saw someone right next to his passenger door. we made eye contact. i used my pelvic floor muscles and turned away mid piss. 

as i walked off hastily i could not for the life of me get my dick back in my pants! i also could not re button them either. result? dick flashing a few cars and a pedestrian. oh god i hope there weren't any kids in those cars...

i finally get my dick back in my pants. i button up. and i start walking across the street. as fast as my shame can take me. that is when i notice the warm rush, then cold of dribble. and not just a little post pee dribble that we are all familiar with. but full on ""look, that guy pissed himself!""

fuck.

to make matters worse, i am wearing acu army pants. so the patch is darker than the rest of the trousers. oh, and i still had to pee desperately.

so this all starts last sunday (new year's eve) when i'm watching youtube videos at random because my mind is reeling after playing hours of no man's sky and barely getting the warp drive (that thing you do almost immediately in the game after getting enough fuel to get your ship into orbit, and i'm playing ironman mode so i want to be super careful about not dying *this time*). it's a ""today i learned"" video talking about this guy's experience living in japan and the japanese anti-hangover drink, with a strong focus on follow up research that takes a good six minutes to explain why and how the primary ingredient works. spoiler alert, it's curcumin from turmeric and how to make it more bio-available to reduce the metabolic development of acetaldehyde. so i grab a tea spoon of turmeric and black pepper from my cupboard and get started on inebriation with a couple cups of cognac and champagne (mix with equal parts plus orange juice to make a delicious royal screw).

later that day (after i've switched to *tecate **light*** by now), i'm reading my _homemade_bathbombs,_salts_and_scrubs_ book i got for christmas (thanks mom!) and think to myself, ""i probably have most of this stuff in the house right now, but i can buy the rest at the store tomorrow. but i don't know where i could find essential oils except online."" and immediately browse on over to amazon to see what can be easily acquired. i get five bottles of different essential oils and check my cart. i see a poly-carbonate container, lid and steel rack that i've been putting off because my sous vide needs have been effectively satisfied by the small version i bought a couple months prior. but i want it and i've been drinking, and it can't possibly be that expensive; plus my bank account says i could have spent more on christmas presents this year if i really wanted to. so i add the container lid and rack to my cart and double check that i have everything i want. not yet, so i do a little more shopping.

i navigate back to my cart and get ready to check out. ""hey vegita, what's his price level?"" ... ""it's, over... eight-hundred! [dollars]"" wow, that's a lot, let me see what i don't really need. essential oils are a little expensive and there's a bunch of them, check. book on brewing, check. additional items for bathbombs, check. sous vide equipment, check. okay, it's yolo time, so i complete the transaction and finish a few videos of epic rap battles of history before going to bed.

fast forward a huge amount of time (3 days, thanks amazon!), and i get a big box in the mail. it's just the lid and one bottle, just tea tree oil (what happened amazon?). it's cool, i'm not expecting anything right away because i (think) i selected super saver shipping. the next day, more packages arrive. my roommate says he found a package at the door, then there was a knock at the door, then he found two more when he went outside, and finally the mailman brought three more packages. they sent my multiple packages with every courier service in the area. i start opening the boxes and find another lid. okay i guess i messed up and ordered a double of the lids, whatever. then i open another box and find the oils, awesome. i open another package and three boxes of sous vide rack are inside, weird. i open the first one to fall out from the trio. it's a full rack, all the rails are there. somehow i ordered three racks for $59 each. now i know why i racked up $800 on amazon.

i call my friend up and ask if he has a sous vide. he's a pro chef, so i'm confident he does and that's part of why he's #1 on my list to get a free rack. i take a picture of the box and he says ""i don't think my container will fit that rack."" oh? well you are in luck my friend, because after opening the large box, i find not one but two poly-carbonate containers. i text him again, ""life pro tip: don't drink and buy on amazon."" and then send him a picture of the container while asking if he has room in his kitchen for the larger container. i still have one _extra_ rack and i'm not the kind of person to return anything i've bought from a store (except computer parts, which god damned it they should always work when they arrive!).

tl;dr i bought $800 of stuff on amazon, and only later found out i bought triple of the most expensive item because i was drunk when i made the order.

but it's not sex related.  
so i've got that going for me, which is nice.  
&nbsp;  
not a throwaway, because fuck it.      
&nbsp;
&nbsp;   
i was in a military school when i was high school and i had a friend that would sneak weed in, anytime he'd go home on leave.  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
*a little bit of a back story*  
&nbsp;    
it had been a while since i had smoked, so i knew i had clean pee at the moment. so, before i started smoking and while my piss was still clean, i pissed in a cup and poured it into a visine bottle *just in case* they wanted to drug test me. (remember this *genius* idea)    
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
well, it was ""lights out"" at 10 pm. the c.o. would usually do patrol at 10:15, 10:30, and again at 11. he was pretty routine. me and my friend had a plan to go smoke at 11:15, just a little bit after his last round of the barracks. i went and met my friend at his room (we were in the same hall, just a few doors down), and we snuck out the fire escape and smoked on the stairs. while we're smoking we see another c.o. from another company outside walking towards our barracks so we run inside.  
&nbsp;  
as i make it through the door, there i find friend #2 standing right inside saying, ""i figured that was yall going outside to smoke! why didn't you invite me!?""
in a whispered voice i replied, ""go back to your room someone is coming up!"" he tells me, ""you better get some eye drops cause your eyes are really red"" and he then runs back to his room.  
&nbsp;  
what he said just kept replaying in my head,  
*""you better get some eyedrops...""*  
*""you better get some eyedrops...""*  
&nbsp;  
when i get in my room, (mind you, no lights are on due to my sneakiness) i run to my medicine cabinet and open the mirror and put visine in both eyes. rushed and jumped in bed, and feeling like the slickest motherfucker cause i made it safe in bed.  
all of a sudden, i was greeted with the most excruciating pain to my eyeballs. holy shit. the burn was unbearable. i jumped out of bed to run my melting eyeballs in some cool water under the faucet in my room. then, i realize....that **wasn't** visine.  
 &nbsp;  
instantly, i start panicking and start having all kinds of crazy thoughts go through my mind.  
*""that was my piss. i just put piss in my fucking eyeballs!""*  
*""im gonna go blind for sure.""*  
*""i'm gonna be known as johnny pisseyes.""*  
*""i'm never gonna hear the end of this.""*    
&nbsp;  
after about fifteen minutes, my eyes finally stopped burning. and on top of that, no c.o. ever even walked by to do rounds. apparently he was just walking past the barracks.  
&nbsp;  
 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
edit: formatting  
&nbsp;
&nbsp;  
edit 2: to clear up the visine mixup.  
i put it in a visine bottle so it'd be small enough to stick in my waistband, sock, etc. to hide it.   
they'd do what they call ""shakedowns"" and search your whole room. it could be a random one to scare people, or because they got a tip. but you'd come back to your room and find everything upside down and thrown around.  
so with my ""genius logic"" a bottle of visine wouldn't look suspicious where it's supposed to be (as long as they didn't notice it wasn't clear with a quick glance) in a medicine cabinet. and, of course, i ended up grabbing the wrong one.

 there is about a 5 year age gap between us so me being 26 now and her 21. when i met her at 18-19 years old she was only 15 and thats all we were was friends through my sister, but as the years passed we hung around each other more and more and i looked at her more as a guy friend because she did everything i liked to do and is one of the toughest girls i've ever met, almost like a brother.

during this time i dated a few girls who treated me terribly but kept the cycle going by going from one bad relationship to another and she was always there in the background, always a friend who was there for me.

about a year ago she got married to a guy she was seeing for probably 6-8 months and was really happy for her until i realized how bad i fucked up and i had everything i wanted in a soulmate right in front of me the entire time. 

now she asks to hang out all the time and i thought everything would be just the way it always has been but its not.  i find myself being awkward and quiet around her now rather then my usual cheerful and happy self. i don't want to ruin the friendship but am finding it so hard to see her, i get so depressed about the whole situation and how bad i screwed up.

i don't know what to do without ruining the friendship or dealing with the depression. what do i do?

edit: thanks for all the advice, it really has helped. i guess my dilemma is, do i ever tell her how i feel? i guess most of the pain stems from having these feelings i can't tell anyone about.

input: Text: so this happened last night. nsfw!!!!

me and my girlfriend were sitting around last night tying to think of something to do, and i came up with the awesome idea to go to the local sex shop and get something so we can have fun tonight. on the way there she tells me she wants to get me a little butt plug and wants me to put it in while i fuck her. i wasn't excited about it, but for whatever reason figure why not.

so we get to the store, look around for a while, then get to the giant wall of anal toys. she's trying to get me to pick one, and i'm honestly pretty shy about being in public and buying a butt plug, so i quickly pick a small one that has a little hole you can stick your finger in and wear as a ring, idk why i picked that one, it seemed right at the time

fast forward a few hours.. we picked up a bottle of tequila on the way home and smoked heavily, so i was feeling pretty frisky. we start doing our thing, i do forplay for her first, then she gets to me. after giving head for a while she tells me to roll over, i know it's game time, and i've prepared myself for this now, so i roll over, hike my ass up, and tell her to do it. she lubes me up good, and slowly works the toy in, didn't feel too good to be honest, but it's in there.

so we start having some serious sex, really hard, squeezing, choking, breathing heavily, rolling around, and i feel the butt plug 100%. this is going on for a few minutes and i slow down for a minute to catch my breath, and when i do i realize the buttplug feels completely different, it doesn't hurt anymore, i could actually barely feel it, so i go to grab the little ring hole and it is not there. i immediately pull out and start looking all over the bed for it, and i can't find it. i tell my girlfriend what's going on and she has me bend over so she can see if she can see it, she can't of course. so i go into full freak out mode because i do not want to be the guy who has to go to the hospital for getting something stuck up in his ass. so i run in the bathroom and try to make myself poop, and after a solid 30 seconds of pushing, sure as shit the butt plug pops out and drops to the bottom of the toilet.

input: Text: so this actually happened today. about an hour ago to be precise.

for context, i'm a 17 year old kid who has the rare privilege of developing vaccines for baylor college of medicine (bcm). not the average summer job that a 17 year old kid can land, and definitely not a position you'd screw around with or take for granted. right.

i'm paired with a researcher on bcm's faculty and workdirectly with the vaccine she is assigned. let's call her shelby. this is the second summer that i've worked with shelby, so her and i have gotten pretty comfortable with each other and love to play little jokes and pranks on each other. she's relatively young, and we are both extremely playful but in this particular incidence, i proved to be too playful
shelby gave me a report template and wanted me to input the data from our last experiment into it. now this template did not allign very well with our data so i was quite lost on what to input. after pointlessly scrolling up and down for a period of time, i thought i'd just play around with shelby before i told her about the issue with the template. i figured i'd pretend to throw a  frustration tantrum over the the report... so i did. i shut off the lab music, closed my monitor, tossed my lab journal on the bench and dramatically stormed out of our lab section. 

after waiting in the hall for a minute or two, i started heading back, giggling at how funny shelby's face would look when she realizes i wasnt really mad. however upon my return, shelby was silently staring at me as i walked towards her. after i finally finished my oblivious laughing fit, i began to tell her about the real issues with the report but i was quickly cutoff. she told me that she appreciated my help over the past two summers, but that my behavior was unacceptable. she told me to go home and not to return. 
i tried my best to explain that i was just playing, but she wouldn't hear it. i kept begging and apologizing but the ""ease4everyone, you need to leave""'s were getting louder and other researchers around us began to stare. i finally packed my bags, apologized once more and left. 
i told the head researcher in the lab what happened and she said i should still come tomorrow and that the 3 of us will have to talk together. 

so yea. what a catastrophic fu. i don't know if i just lost my once-in-a-lifetime job or not yet, but i'll be sure to update tomorrow after we have our ""talk"".

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so this was on monday, idgaf.

so sunday evening, my and my girlfriend decide to make a nice little trip home to her hometown. she wanted to see her cats (she's basically the ideal redditor gf, don't know why she picked previously  forever alone me). 

its about 638 degrees out with 300% humidity on monday so we decide to relax by the pool. such an amazing idea for pale, pasty, out of shape, screen loving me. my forearms are decently tan because out of all my cars not one has a/c so i get that awesome left arm only farmers tan in the summer.

she starts putting on various skin products so she doesn't burn and gets a glorious bronze tan. at this point i say ""i don't need any of that, i don't burn. plus i'll be underwater! i need to be tan since i'm starting that new landscaping job anyways!""

god damn aren't i stupid.

day goes well, swimming, drinking and whatnot. demolished the best pizza and buffalo nachos that have ever been created.

good day, right?

we get back to my apartment and i remove my t-shirt. apparently i'm still wearing a red t-shirt underneath. i lather that sum-bitch up with aloe and call it a night.

day 1: go to work, my torso aches a bit. any time someone's had gets close to me i stare them down like an african lion pursuing the weak gazelle in the pack. aloe that sum-bitch up some more and hit the sack.

day 2: i wake up. don't know what time it is, clocks are irrelevant at this point. my entire red t-shirt itches like i'm being tea bagged by satan's untrimmed bush. i sprint to the bathroom like usian bolt and lather that sum-bitch up with some aloe. 

my skin puts off a laugh like that stupid little girl from the exorcist. after about 3 seconds flat of relief i feel like my pores are being raped by fire ants. 

must get this aloe off, stat.

cue the coldest shower in the world. imagine those people in the antarctic getting those core samples of the glacier. they would call this shower napalm in comparison to what they were used to. the water couldn't get any colder. it felt great.

climbed out of the shower. dried off, jumped immediately back into the shower. if something that can sink the titanic isn't touching me, i itch to the point where i would rather eat a handful of gauge 0 steel wool every day for the rest of my life.

new idea, grab a face rag. i think ""hey, genius, if that skin isn't there any more, it won't hurt!"" cue ferocious scrubbing.

holy shit this is somehow worse.

at this point my girlfriend enters the bathroom to find out what's up. i tell her, she runs to walmart and buys anything that says ""anti-itch"" on it and a box of benadryl. she gets back and i lather myself up in every one of those ointments and take some benadryl.

i'm still high on benadryl, i'm scared to stop taking it.

definitely gonna say yes on the sunblock next time.

so i stated to move my bed to the place i wanted it, but i have a second fold away ed under it and it was getting in the way, i decided to just lift up the bed and mattress, instead of just taking the mattress off to make it easier.

 as i was carrying my bed over to where i want it i stood on my tv plug which had the 3 prongs facing up, and they stabbed into my foot badly, i tripped and the plug did not fall off my foot (i should point out i was doing all this bare foot like an idiot) and dropped the bed leg on top of my thigh and now its seriously bruised and both my leg and foot hurt what i walk anywhere

all is well. the board isn't even burned. i check to make sure the blade isn't bent. it isn't. i poke at the blade to make sure it hasn't come loose. and by ""poke at"", i mean that i did what every single shop teacher i have ever had told me exactly not to do. i grabbed that blade and wiggled it.

input: Text: so, quick disclaimer, this happened 3 days ago, and it's not so big of a fuckup, but under certain circumstances could have been.

this story starts on **wed**, i had a final and decided to stay awake studying all night (i obviously failed, because that's not how college works) this action shifted my sleep cycle really hard; went to sleep at 14:00 and woke up at around 20:00, ending that ""day"" going to bed at around 8 in the morning of **thu**.

now i had a basketball game scheduled with my friends at 16:00 that day, if you do the math it would be little less to 8 hours of sleep, good enough... for normal people, i'm a sleepyhead and got awakened by my friend calling me, already 10 minutes late for the match. this puts a lot of pressure on me (because everybody pays for the court but the latter you arrive, the less time you have to play) so i did something that i don't recall doing before, jumped out of bed, put on my pants an shoes, grab my phone, and went straight to the car, and recklessly drive at dangerous speeds to the court (another not recommended/illegal thing).

get in the match without even warming up a bit, and i give all of myself for the next 30 minutes or so, and then i start noticing something: i'm feeling light-headed, and it's getting a little hard to breathe (beyond normal fatigue). -""huh, might be because i didn't warm up, gonna play more defensive""- i think, but as the game goes on, i get worse and worse, until it's very hard for me to even walk, and keep my eyes open, and this is where i realized: **""i haven't eaten anything for the past 18 hours or so""**. 

my pressure is at floor level. after sitting for a bit, and people asking me what's going on, the dude that manages the court (a real bro) brings me some cookies with sugar, and helps me to go get some air.

the rest of the match went alright, those cookies saved me and the match (not really, we lost, but at least i participated...).

i hope this serves as a lesson, that no exercise can happen with an empy stomach, because well... that's where all of your energy comes from actually.

input: Text: this was not today, but about a year ago. to give a little background, i almost never use emojis. i think it's a scandalous waste of time to search through so many damn icons to find the singular one (or multiple) to glitz up ""my day was fine. how about you?"" 

one particular day for me however, was an emoji day. my best friend told me she was sleepy but used a bunch of weird emojis because, according to her, there was no such thing as a sleepy face emoji. in my smartass way, i had to prove her wrong. though i didn't even know if there really was one, i set out to find it and prove that bitch wrong. 

low and behold, it existed. i sent it to her, but clearly this wasn't a sick enough burn on my part. i proceeded to type the sleepy face emoji in a bunch, then copy and paste, then copy and paste that, and then copy and paste that. i sent one with a couple hundred emojis and my phone started to send out the texts slower, but i was determined. after squaring my emoji number several times, i must have been up to a million 😴 emojis or close to it. i hit send.

my phone crashed. it died. at that point, i knew that i fucked up. my smartassery had gone too far. friend tells me her phone crashed too. my phone didn't turn on for awhile and when it finally did turn back on, but i couldn't access my message app. i couldn't send texts for days. eventually my phone recovered enough to open the message app, but every time i tried to open up my friends messages, it'd crash. i tried deleting the messages, but to no avail. i fucked up. i sent too many damn emojis for my phone to handle. it's been a year and i still can't text my friend on the number. my phone has forgiven, but it has not forgotten.

whoops. 😴😴

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: the past few days i have been really, really sick with tonsilitis. one simple thing that makes me feel so much better is just taking a nice hot shower or bath. i live in apartments though, so i can never really get my water to stay hot for more than 15 or 20 minutes. so today, to celebrate finally overcoming my fever i was gonna run a nice hot bath, soak in that for like 30 minutes and then rinse off with a shower once i let the water have time to be hot again. this is the most energy i've spent on a single task in several days so i was fuckin pumped. i start to run the hot bath and get in and see that my roommate had just bought some fancy all natural peppermint oil body wash. i'm all like helllll yeahhhh lets bump this bath into a spa day! so i squirt some body wash into the running water in an attempt to make a bubble bath. no bubbles. more body wash. still no bubbles. i keep doing this until the tub is full and i've used at least 20-30% of her new stuff, oops. i put my whole face and body under and i feel great, all warm and tingly and relaxed, for like 60 seconds. then it gets really cold, and i'm like its ok i just need to adjust... so i sit for another few minutes, trying to adjust, but it just keeps getting colder and colder and more and more tingly until my whole body starts burning and i have to get out. when i get out its like i've stepped out of the bath, and into the arctic tundra. my body is so cold and its been like 103° for the past 4 days so it doesn't know what the fuck is happening. i'm shivering and sweating and no amount of blankets is helping, and then i have to wait at least 30 minutes for the water to come out hot again so i can rinse the soap off me. id rather have a fever for 4 days than to ever have to feel the tingle that this bubble bath gave me ever again. the option of taking a cold shower would result in freezing my skin into thin paper sheets and cracking open. so i resort to blowdrying my entire body on high for a very long 30 minutes until the water reaches a very mild definition of warm. but being covered in peppermint oil and blowdrying your body for 30 minutes has this sensation that i really cant describe. but still not worth it.

input: Text: this story goes back to 2012. i was being very lazy with my diabetes and wasn't doing anything. i was 14 at the time. i had gone a week without checking and around the 3rd day in i started feeling like i had the flu. my mother also thought i had the flu and was just treating me as so. after a week of being sick my grandmother came over and said we are going to the hospital. i knew i was fucked, they were about to find out i hadn't been doing my shit correctly. i remember walking outside and everything was so bright. like if you turned the contrast up very high on a monitor it was bad. after being at the hospital for a while they ran tests and hooked me up to an ivs, the hospital checked my sugar and it was 1025, they confirmed i was in diabetic ketoacidoesis (diabetic ketoacidosis (dka) is a life-threatening condition that develops when cells in the body are unable to get the sugar (glucose) they need for energy because there is not enough insulin.) here is where the hospital fucked up. instead of slowly administrating insulin to reduce numbers slowly, they gave me a bolus of insulin which is enough to get 1025 down to my target range which is 80-120. doing that made my brain swell causing me to go in to a 17 hour coma. the doctors basically told my mother to pick out a tombstone because i was in critical condition and most children my age don't make it in some cases. after being in critical condition for 2 days, i started feeling better again and was tired of being in the hospital. basically take care of your diabetes, it can get serious quick around these parts boys.

(that's a story in and of itself really). finally i was able to calm down enough and ended up falling asleep at 2:30am. i got up at 5am as usual, and thinking a shower would help, go take one. normally i have a lot of trouble sleeping and can barely sleep in a bed, let alone in any other weird situation. i was nearly nodding off in the shower. got out and couldn't hold my head up. deciding this was too dangerous to drive under, i called the number on my work papers and left a message. i tried to wait to see if they would call me when they opened. after slamming my face on the keyboard from failure to hold my head up. i called it quits and went to sleep. stupidly i should've taken my phone so it would wake me if they called. i slept til near 1pm. got up and saw they returned my call. my voicemail was from the training woman who had not received my message. this is the moment i found out if i had taken my phone into my bedroom, i could've still come in. the voice mail said i could still show up within an hour or so.  cue me trying to call back. at 3:45pm i finally get an answer and get told the class is full and now they have to roll me back to the start date of december 30. i've already been stuck at home with nothing to do for weeks, now that's going to be extended, all because my sorry ass cannot get to sleep when i need to.

input: Text: a bit of backstory: my eldest nephew, my parents' first grandchild, died very suddenly a month ago. he and i were very close, and he was only 6 months younger than me. my family have been crushed, obviously. we have a beautiful photo of him on our coffee table in the living room, which my mum and i use to talk to him. 

i live with my parents, and my mum and dad recently bought new couch cushions because our old ones were flat and uncomfortable. however, these new ones have these white, soft feathers in, which constantly poke through the fabric and stab you in the back. 

now i've taken a bit of a habit of pulling the fathers out whenever they poke me, and just placing them on the nearest flat surface. the seat beside me, on an empty plate, my fiance's leg, the dog's back, just anywhere that i can place them. 

today i pulled one out and placed it on the coffee table, and then went upstairs to play xbox. fast forward 20 minutes, and i can hear my mum crying. i go downstairs to comfort her, something that i've become accustomed to since my nephew died, and instead she looks kind of happy. i ask her what's up, and she beams at me with tears in her eyes and says ""oh, tashalou, there was this beautiful white feather right next to [my nephew's] photograph! he's still with us!""

i looked at the feather with wide eyes, and realised it was the feather that i'd pulled out of the cushion. my mum was holding it delicately, as if it were gold itself, when in reality it'd had been stabbing me in the arse less than 30 minutes before. 

i quickly explained that it was from the couch, for reasons i don't even understand myself, and my mum got upset, and stated in her bedroom all evening.

so this didn't happen today. typical, yes, however, i did not think to put it here until recently. 

quick background:

i met this girl at a party that a mutual friend was throwing. i will call her *b* for this story. she is absolutely gorgeous and funny and i wanted her from the moment i laid eyes on her. we became good friends and enjoyed coitus frequently until one night i got too drunk and upset her (another fu for another time). over the time that we were indulging each other in the sinful pleasures of heathens, we both developed that thing nobody wants in our situation: ***feelings!!*** due to past relationship issues, we both nope'd out of the perverted agreement and took a month off of seeing each other.


the fu:

so fast forward to the beginning of summer. i am working two jobs, one being at a local establishment where people gather to damage their livers and lungs (and most recently, a sin). i texted *b* to come to where i worked so i may let her know how i felt about the whole thing. i wasn't looking to throw her off or win her back, as i had learned she was dating another guy. i just needed to get it all off my chest. she responded...quite well. we continued to talk and before i know it we are talking about how things will be when she ends things with her current beau. now we are dating and i can't help but feel guilty for being with this girl. i do not see us lasting a long time and i want to end things with her before we are too involved, yet our long background already put me in a bind. now i am in a relationship (which i don't do well in) with a girl (who i care for but not in a way that merits an intimate relationship).

input: Text: okay, so this happened a fair while ago, but i've only just discovered this sub, plus the story still sticks with me to this day.

so, my older sister had just gotten engaged to this really cool survivalist-type guy, so the family celebrated by going on a camping trip, around the fire on the first night my sister's fiance decided telling some jokes would be fun, we all took turns, and as it came to mine i decided i'd tell a pretty racist joke cause i wanted to impress the fiance.
(not going to repeat for fear of insulting people)
as it turns out, the race of the fiance was the same as the race i was joking about, and it was an extremely insulting joke, after a few shocked faces and awkward seconds later, my sister said updated me on the facts, and the guy got up and left the camp entirely along with my sister.
come next week and we get an announcement from my sister that the engagement was canceled due to the fiance despising racists and hating myself and my family.

 

edit: just some things to clarify;
         - we later found out that he was already having difficulties with my family, and that just pushed him over
           the edge.
         - the guy was from new zealand, but his complexion didn't make it obvious at all, albeit i probably should
           have gotten a hint from his accent.
         - lastly, i don't remember it entirely, but it was a pretty common one about them screwing their sheep, it
           also had something to do with his mother too. if you guys really want it i'll try to google it to see if it
           comes up.

i took the lid of the liter box and squatted over it, and took a giant dump in the hallway, squatting over a liter box, with the cat giving me the evil eye. since it was an emergency situation, it was out and done pretty quickly. i used the scoop and covered it with sand, then grabbed a plastic bag and scooped it all up, tied the bag and dumped it in the trash.

 so my day yesterday was great. weather is gorgeous, i feel awesome, everything is grand. i enjoy my afternoon off work with a nice nap, after which i wake up feeling like absolute misery. fucking hell, im getting sick, aren't i? throat hurts, nose is stuffed, head feels like a watermelon being smashed, but less delicious. 

 suffice to say i am up all night, feeling like garbage. super tired in the morning, i decide its time to stock up on soups and cold medicine. after that mission is accomplished, i am stoked for some goddamn chicken and dumpling warmth.... and here is when my brain officially shuts off. 

 my fluffy cat daisy, who is always underfoot, chose the moment i go to pour the can of soup (progressive!) into the pot... im paying zero attention. tripping over her at the perfect moment of pour, the can slips from my hand, causing a little soup tsunami to wash over the edge of the pan... and directly onto my poor cat. about half the can. hardly any made it to the floor, as her fluff caught it all. i cleaned her off best i could. i figure at least her bath will taste great :/. she'll probably get a real bath in a bit.

input: Text: posting on an alt account cause of redditor friends. also using peoples initials instead of names

so the last few days i've been feeling a little down, missing my ex who i broke up with back in june.

yesterday i went for drinks with a girl from work who is also part of my main friend group and things went okay. nothing happened but we both had a good time, but i'm pretty much 100% in the friendzone with this girl.

fast forward to this morning. i wake up and i see a snapchat on her story of her being bored with the caption text ""anyone free today?"" so i texted her and asked her to meet for lunch, she then asks if the rest of our friend group is coming, i tell her that i wasn't planning on inviting them, trying to hint that i want it to be just us again. after that, the conversation went a little something like this

a: why not? you fallen out with them or something?

me: no, but i know k and l are broke so they probably won't anyway

a: i'm broke too, not sure if i'm up for it

me: i don't mind paying for you, silly :p

a: i dunno.

at this point i realise she's not interested so i decide to leave it there and tell her not to worry about it. due to the shitty nature of my day and waking up in what was one of the most depressed states i've been in for a while, i decide to have a smoke and go back to bed. 

wake up, round 2, let's do this.

i decide to send my ex (e) a message, we're on good terms and really good friends (we only broke up because long distance whilst she's at uni was taking it's toll, we both still like each other and getting back together is on the table). 

""hey, how've you been? i'm missing you like crazy today,""

press send. think nothing of it.

couple minutes later, my phone buzzes. i've got a reply... from c.

i sent that message to c? c is the girl i drunkenly made moves on at the last work party, and have since been infatuated with, but she's got a boyfriend so i'm trying to move past it. 

c: ahaha, oh dear. you're still a bit obsessed aren't you?

what have i done. i've just gone and made a fool of myself. i tell her i meant to send it to someone else but she doesn't believe me. 

a couple of minutes later i get a text from a

a: c just told me about your text. so you get turned down by me and move on to her within an hour? jesus you're desperate.

<s> work will be fun tomorrow </s>

 

i know this isn't as much of a fuck up as most of the stories on here, but i feel like i need to share this with someone.

i remembered how the hair gel felt slimy and slippery, and i wondered if it would make a better lube than the lotion i normally use. so i decided to use the hair gel instead. i applied a generous amount and began to masturbate. i'm not gonna lie, it felt pretty glorious.

fast forward a few minutes, i finish, and i put my pants back on and thought nothing of it. until a few hours later. 

i began to notice some discomfort in my pants, and it kept getting worse as time passed. eventually i decided to investigate. i went to pull my pants down, only to discover that i couldn't. 

turns out the hair gel had acted like glue and glued my penis and balls to my underwear. after several agonizing minutes of slowly peeling my underwear off my crotch, i managed to get them off. 

now i was faced with two new problems: 

1. that was my only clean pair of underwear, and now there's dried hair gel in them. 

2. i still felt pretty uncomfortable because my cock and balls were glued to each other. 

i took a shower, carefully rinsing all the evil hair gel off of myself. never again.

input: Text: so this happened quite a while back. most of my relatives are beekeepers. some are huge commercial operations. i was working for a relative and he had a foreman who happened to be a long time family friend. 
so we are out in the field working on hives and bent over looking for queen bees so we could split up hives to make new hives. now keep in mind this guy is a bit weird in some ways that i never suspected. i always tie shoe laces around the bottom of my trousers so i won't have a bee wandering up my leg and causing a panic. i never saw the foreman use such tactics. 
i found out that day he went without underwear as well. so anyway, he suddenly stands up and looks at me with a shocked expression of panic. then he hauls off and smacks himself right in the nuts as hard as he can with an open palm. he goes down on his knees again and stays there groaning. of course i am all puzzled and surprised as i never saw anyone ever do this in my life. 
after he recovers i ask him what happened and he informs me  a bee just tried wandered up on his family jewels all aggressive and wanting to sting where it really hurts. so he shakes and maneuvers until he is sure the dead bee is safely back down his pant leg. 

a couple days go by and we are back in the same yard repeating the process on some more hives. splitting them up to create new hives. he and i are again faced off in two nearby sections. all is peaceful with the droning of the bees and the warm sun on our backs. perfect blissful working day. suddenly he bolts upright like he did last time. all panicked and wild eyes. he raises his arm to again deliver the killing strike to his nuts and then suddenly stops in mid swing. just standing there staring at me with his right arm frozen mid swing and that crazy panicked look of a deer in the headlights. then he screams in agony and starts grabbing and squeezing his crotch. he goes down on his knees still screaming and he finally subsides to just groans of agony. he's still scrabbling at his crotch the whole time. finally he gets it worked out the best he can and walks off to the orange orchards. he comes back later and tells me a bee actually stung him on the head of his penis. he can still hobble about the job and seems to recover during the day. i am just chocking on my laughter. he obviously didn't want to hit himself in the nuts like a couple days before. later during lunch i remind him it might be a good idea to at least use some duct tape on his pant legs. 
as we are loading up to go home on that friday he tells me he can't wait to get home as his prick is all swelled up and super sensitive and he wants to try it out with his wife for the most amazing sex he thinks he will ever have. 
i kinda wonder if he ever tried it again deliberately. who knows, it could become a thing if this gets out. haha. too late now...

input: Text: tifu i am a senior in high school, my year has consisted of losing all interest in my classes and writing essay responses for college applications. my mistake happened an hour ago. i was in the midst of writing a response to the most ridiculous prompt i've ever received. instead of using the application site i chose to use google docs, for college sites rarely have the option to save your progress and return later. while making my document i rushed through and mistakenly clicked out of the title box. i didn't realize my cursor was at the top of the page instead of the title segment and wrote my title as the top line of essay instead. my title was ""suck my ass #@$!* state this prompt bit the big one."" i wrote the rest of my essay praising the college and talking myself up, and after enough butt kissing i copied and pasted my work onto my application and submitted. i didn't realize what i did until i accidentally pasted my essay onto a blank paper i created and saw that glorious first sentence...

input: Text: i live with my dad and take care of him since he was diagnosed with lymph-node cancer.  my father was throwing a birthday party for his girlfriend debbie today (my mom passed away several years ago).  i was out all day at a christening and then bowling with my friend and his wife.  i came home and had a few beers with my dad and his girlfriend before they went to sleep.  i grabbed a few more beers once they went to bed and got a little hungry.  
  my dad is famous for his dry rub and makes porkchops for every party.  i saw a stack of porckchops in the fridge and assumed that they were the leftovers from the party.  i found a big ole porkchop and threw it in the microwave for two minutes brought it downstairs and started to get down.  i was about seven beers deep a this point between bowling and the beers i had at home but noticed the consistency was just wrong.  my dad had just scored the chops a little so they would keep better but they were raw in the middle and i had chowed on almost half of one.
  i have a pretty sturdy digestive tract, i've been in fourteen countries and sampled the cuisine and violated the rules on bottled water.  but i know trichinosis is no joke and am worried i am going to spend father's day crapping and vomiting instead of cooking corned beef for my dad as planned.

input: Text: so i'll try and keep this short, though the ordeal itself felt like it went on for a life time and i still get the aftershocks of it 3 years later... so i guess you could say this is an eternal fu forever plaguing my mind. 
i'll set the scene, so it’s a beautiful day and a bbq is occurring. a nice mixture of family and friends are all crammed into my garden enjoying the rarity of the english sun. perfect.  
there are no seats at this point so i'm just standing on the side-lines, taking in the view. the wine's gone to my head so i'm just standing still and having a creepy little nostalgic smile to myself. my thoughts are broken by a slight tickle on my arm. i look down to see an ant, i promptly flick him away and that's that. ohhhh but it wasn't. he returned. with a friend. with 4 friends. i’m so itchy right now. what’s that on my face? how did you get up here? how did your friends get up here? i am now slapping my own face. i then look down and this was the moment i lost all sanity…
 have you ever seen a disturbed ants nest before? when about 100000000+ frenzied ants spill out of a little hole on the ground and just run about in a riot of complete ant-carnage.  well, since i was the one who destroyed their home and unknowingly persisted to just stand on it, arrogantly smiling away at my dear friends and family while ant-anarchy was unfolding beneath my feet; i guess i made it easy for them to take their revenge. i was covered. my legs no longer a caucasian colouring but ant black. thousands of vengeful ants were marching up my leg to meet with the rest of their thousand friends who had already made it to every suspecting part of my body. i could feel them up my dress, on my stomach, in my belly button, my back, shoulders, neck, ears, in my hair…in my underwear.  as any normal person would do, i freak.
blind panic has taken over me now, i'm running on pure terrified adrenaline and i no longer notice the world around me. friends, family and the whole bbq around me just melt away. my vision is tunnelled and all that seizes to exist on this planet are the ants and me. the body invading ants and me.  all that matters in the whole world at this point is killing them all. obviously the only logical thing to do here is just get naked. get naked and just whack, flick, jab, slap and occasionally punch them all. and maybe if i run? run, yes i'll run around and then they'll just drop off me! so now i'm partly naked, i'm jabbing, i’m slapping,  i'm running around in a small circle, flaying myself around in some kind of voodoo fashion whist making a noise that could only be described as pig being slaughtered. but it's just the ants and me, these killer ants and me and i'm winning.
once the ants were somewhat defeated and my sanity returned, as did the world around me. you could have heard a pin drop. every eye was on me; with a look you might have gave britney spears if you knew her in 2007, as if a psychotic episode has just happened in front of their eyes. 
i still feel the ants crawling over me now. if a stray hair brushes my arm, full freak out threatens to erupt again. i’m living in fear, people. be kind to ants.

i went to a friend's party and decided to do my thing on the roof, where the people who wanted to chill out from all the dancing and drinking going on downstairs went. it went excellently well - i was really in the zone. i had even breathed fire successfully earlier, but i tried something new without practicing: kneeling down and breathing upwards, rathern than at an angle.

the result: a drop of kerosene fell onto my beard, and another on my shirt, and i spent five seconds with half my face on fire. i suffered first and second degree burns, but after soaking my face in water and applying some ointment, i was fine... and even breathed fire again.

 this fuck up happened about five minutes ago. i'm in a bathroom stall shaming myself.
so i was at the bathroom in my school's library and as i was fixing my hair i noticed a pimple near my ear. it looked and felt ready, and i was alone so i decided that it would be a good time to pop it. 
so i wash my hands first and go at it. here's the thing, this pimple was more than ready, this thing was just waiting to explode.
and explode it did. it barely needed any pressure for it to pop and squirt onto the mirror. at that very moment i heard the bathroom door open and i, being the smart person i am, decided that the best i could was to wipe the pimple juice with my hand. mistake. it smeared, as you could emyself, leaving a streak of grossness.the girl walked in and i looked at her. eye contact was made. i looked away, feeling my face redden. she goes into a stall and i immediately begin to wash my hands and grab paper towels to clean the mess. just as i finish i can hear the girl open up her stall door and i go and hide in another stall. yes, i am a grown up, but the shame overwhelmed me.

 

update: as i posted this i finally left the bathroom and as i was walking towards the computers unconsciously gave that pimple another squeeze. more stuff squirted onto my hand and now i have to walk back to the bathroom and clean up. again.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: tifu (well 16 years ago really) so i remember vividly a story about how ifu on a hot date. it started when i met this girl in university, she was two years older than me, extremely hot and from greece. we would go out for coffee after class here and there and each time she would say, ""i have to go get my brother now. see you tomorrow!"" or if it was friday she would say that she would miss me over the weekend. so things were going great!
now, i was never much of a pothead or a drinker, but the weekend before our first date i was hanging out with my buddies, going off a bender and had smoked a little too much. a buddy of mine told us a joke, a bunch of guys were having a laugh. no women in the house to have a say in the humour. (that should have been my clue.) now another buddy of mine, with a thick irish accent comes up in front of the tv and shouts out, ""hey how do you kill a retard?"" we were laughing so hard already at all the other stupid jokes, ""you give him a knife!"" the irish dude said as he mimicked a mentally challenged person hitting himself by the heart with his right hand. let us just say that monday was a day for me to sober up.
looking back is 20/20.
our first date went well. dinner, movies and a kiss. the second date pretty much happened the next day. i was weirded-out but good to go. i suggested we go to a comedy club. she suggested we go some place with her brother but without any persuasion from me, she, well she liked the idea of going to a comedy club and said that she would see what she could do for her brother. (that should have been another clue.) she calls back and exited. i'm exited. we go to a just for laugh (in montreal) and sit and chat before the show. we get closer. show starts, we laugh, show ends, we walk on a beautiful summer night and she leads me to her house. she begins to tell me a joke or two, we laugh. i tell her a few jokes myself, we laugh. some were naughty jokes, others were just cruel. for example, she would go off with a beautiful greek accent, ""how is casino like a woman?"" giggle, "" liquor in front, poker in back!"" and give me a sexy look. i mean things were happening! so what do i do, i say the worst possible joke i could ever say to her, the one my irish buddy said to me the last weekend before we went out on our date. she gives me a sad look, ""my brother-"" pauses, ""my brother is mentally challenged you know."" she says to me. my jaw drops. i don't get laid, that's obvious enough. and she walks away, never to say another word to me. i would see her here and there, in class, but that was the end of it.

(the acoustics in that place are fucked up and the 3ds is a lot louder than you'd think it'd be.)

there was this couple sitting next to me. besides the three of us and the staff, there was no-one there. the guy was holding the girl while she was shaking and talking in a soft voice - it must've been real serious shit they were discussing, man. i could make out something about her ex, but that was it. however, as it was none of my business, i ignored them.

so i popped out my copy of smash. i main lucario and decided it'd be fun to run a few sudden death rounds with him. this wasn't a serious match, so i picked my favorite stage (and honestly a stage where i find lucario performs the best)

guess what that stage was.

i promptly close my 3ds and sit awkwardly for a while, then walk out. i don't think i'll be going there for a while.

i was flipping through the shirts looking for a goddamn 17 34/35 which never is fucking in-stock when mom scooches in nice and close to me to find a shirt for son 2. i smile -which i guess is the queue to these over-sharers- and slide around the back to hopefully find a goddamn fucking shirt that fits! mom keeps glancing at me, and i smile at her again.

mom: ""excuse me, sir. what size shirt are you? usually my husband does this stuff but he's out of town, ya know?""

me: ""17 34/35. make sure you check the fit too if you're looking for slim fit"", i respond.

mom: ""oh, thank you so much! do you think son 2 would be a 15 or 16?""

me: ""uhh... try 16..""

mom: ""oh, thank you so much! here, son 2, do you like this color? you've been a real help. i feel like i was just doing this too!""

me: ""uh-huh""

i wasn't really paying attention anymore. 

*this fucking 17 34/35 doesn't exist, i'm getting texted about plans for dinner, and i doubt anythings getting done at the office. and this bitch keeps talking to me like i care.*

now i really have zoned her out now and she's still rambling on. but wait-whats this? 17 34/35! fucking yes! ok- socks time. 

me: ""well, goodluck! have a nice day""

and i walk off to find a few pairs of dress socks. guess who's following me over.. mom and son. son 2 is in the fitting room.

*great.. time to smile and nod as she rambles on some more. socks socks socks... these are plain and boring enough for me. comes with 3 pairs! sweet! the trip is 3 days! 3, 3, 3 lucky number 3! this was easy with the lucky number 3! man, i love 3.*

mom: ""--- so that's two in just this month!""

me: ""huh- yah.. i hope theres three!""

and i look up and mom is frozen with a look of absolute terror on her face. son looks up from his phone with his face twisted like he'd just smelt his finger after scratching his balls. i'm confused, done with the day and just say,

me: ""yeah.. bye.""

i walk away not really knowing what happened until i bump into son 2 as he walks out of the fitting room.

son 2: ""hey, thanks! shirt fit great.""

me: ""you're welcome.""

now, son 2 started to get a little teary eyed and i started feeling really awkward..

son 2: ""this sucks.""

me: ""uh- the shirt?""

then it hit me.. mom was behind me swinging her purse smacking me in the side of the head. i'm not even going to try to type out what she was yelling. 

all i got was that the husbands father and sister both passed away this month and this was the second funeral that they've had to go to. and in my moment of singing about socks i wished them a third death in their family. 

i tried to apologize but ended up just dropping my shirts and socks off on an end-cap and leaving the store. i don't think they ever really understood what i was saying over the sound of the purse attached to the end of a wind turbine smashing into me and all the clothes racks nearby.

input: Text: so i'm taking a brutal class this semester taught by our universities assistant dean. it also doesn't help that i've been sick constantly and missed class a few times, as well as some assignments. the end of semester is here and today there is a lab write up due. of course it's on one of the few labs i was sick during. 

so here i am, attempting to bs a paper that will be read by someone who is paid to see through bs. and i decide to start calculating what my grade is at now. this isn't easy because at the end of the semester she curves the grades. but unless the curve is substantial i'm pretty much going to fail. 

doing this took quite a bit of time and i'm now 30 min away from the deadline and there is absolutely no way i can write the paper in that short of time. hell, i don't know if i could write it at all since i don't really know what we did for the lab.  so pretty much i'm going to fail this class.

input: Text: so like most fuck ups on here this happened years ago ( i was about 10 years old at the time)

i feel like i should start by explaining that my parents have sex, a lot. like i mean i used to hear them every single night going at it, and to this day i have no idea why they thought that me and my sister didn't hear them.

anyway back on topic, my parents both had to work late this day, so being 10 years old, my gran was over babysitting me and my younger sister, we were just chilling in the dining room, doing some crosswords and watching tv. you know, the norm for a very unpopular 10 year old kid with all but 1 friend, and that's when i heard it, my mums phone going off, i don't know why she didn't have it on her, although i do remember it being connected to the charger and she only worked a 5 minute drive away so that could possibly be the reason. so me being an innocent kid runs up to her phone to see that my dad had messaged her, well ofcourse i innocently, without thinking, opened the text and to my absolute horror read the text sent to her from my dad.

""hey babe you still good for a shagging tonight?""

those words have been engraved in my head ever since that day, and to through the fucking icing on the cake my gran-obviously noticing the horror on my face-decides she wants to see and says ""throwaway1472000 let me see that"" well ofcourse being in a state of total shock and not knowing how to get myself out of the situation i pass the phone to my gran, needless to say my mum got in from work and my gran grabbed her coat and left with the driest, ""goodbye"" i have ever heard in my entire life. to this day (to my knowledge) my mother has no idea that my gran read this text.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this just happened fifteen minutes ago. i'm a night security guard at a rice packaging factory with the very easy job of just performing a single patrol every hour. a normal patrol consist of just walking around outside and inside the factory and making sure nothing is amiss. 

on my last patrol everything was normal, nothing going on and no one trying to break in. but as i entered the factory and began walking around, i took notice of a consistent hissing sound. i immediately knew what it was; one of the many air hoses that are connected to one of the air compressors. not a big deal, all i would need to do is find the hose emitting the sound and trace it back to its source and shut it off.

it didn't take me long to track down the culprit, but when i lifted up the air hose and gave it a slight tug, i noticed it was caught on something. i then proceeded to do probably the stupidest thing i could have done. i pulled the damn thing.

what followed was the most horrifying thing i could have witnessed here at this job. when i pulled on the hose, i didn't realize it was somehow wrapped around one of the many stacks of pallets, which are filled with bags of rice, and caused the large stack to tilt to the side. 

it then fell side ways and fell into another stack of pallets, and those fell into even more stacks. this continued until every stack on the left side of the building was knocked over and spewing their contents everywhere. i have no idea how many pallets were stacked up there, but it was at least half of the factory.

i just stood there the entire time, holding the offending hose in my hands as i watched the tall stacks of pallets filled with bags of rice falling over, causing rice to pour along the floor like a wave upon a beach. 

after it was all over, i just stood there, looking at my fuck up. i gathered myself, went and found the tank that the hose was connected to and turned it off, and returned to my guard shack. i have two hours before employee's start arriving, and i have no idea what i'm going to say.

 

update: so, after the factory boss came in, i told him what happened. and boy was he not happy. but after all of the yelling, he asked if the stack was poorly stacked, which it was. i also told him that the air hose may have been wrapped around the second pallet of the stack, which it may have been. 

yes, i was fired. but i've already been approved to be moved to another location next week. the security company acknowledged it wasn't my fault entirely, but still wasn't happy about the whole situation.

on the plus side, i'm getting moved to a even better looking factory with a little bit better pay. so i guess this situation has a plus side. for me at least, those factory workers are probably not having a good day today.

input: Text: i've been lurking for a while now and created a throw-away because, well, if anyone finds out this was me then i guess i'm... not sure what to do.

i've read through some of these f*ck ups, and thought, ""wow, these guys are morons."" nothing would have prepared me for last night, though. and if you think you'll never f*ck up as bad, then count your lucky stars until then. i'm currently in a hotel and unsure what to do at this point, as i'm pretty sure my life is permanently ruined, but here's the story. please offer advice because i couldn't sleep last night and i can't sleep tonight after this.

i've been coming over a really bad cold, the kind you get that blocks your sense of smell and taste completely. this becomes important later. also, i love to use *a lot* of soap. this also becomes important later.

so, i was out of soap yesterday evening and figured what the hell - i'll use my dish washing soap. now, i've done this before and have had no issues what so ever. it's like poor man's soap. so, i'm lathering this on; my bathroom now has a really dim light as the main light blew out. i'm putting on so much, and i'm thinking to myself, thank god i can't smell this stuff, because it probably smells really bad. so i continue lathering this stuff on *everywhere*, completely, and fully. then i get to my head (i always do face/hair shampoo last). and what do you know, the shampoo is empty. ok, i thought, no worries, i'll use the dish soap in my hair. now by this point my skin is starting to sting. i'm thinking to myself, well that didn't happen before when i tried this, but i ignored it. so, i continue and get my face in this stuff and get the hair dish soaped up. 

now i have this really big headache. well shit, this cold sucks, i think. what i didn't realize is that the headache wasn't from the cold, but from the soap i was using. so i went to bed stinging all over - balls and all. fuck, i thought, i have to buy soap in the morning, this stinging sucks. well, i was really tired and slept through it all. i woke up this morning and the burning sensation is now magnified. then i remembered the kind of dish soap i bought. added bleach. my heart's racing. i pray as i sprint to the fucking bathroom. and through the dim light my heart stopped as i stared at my now, white face. my parents are from africa. fuck. 

i'm a professional. i couldn't go to work today. i'm screwed.

very scared of being yelled at, but still had that inner courage of owning up to my fault and going over there. my mother contacted their daughter (in college). she told her dad, and i walked over, he came out, i tell him what had happened and it all goes smoothly and he just tells me to be more careful and shoot down the hill on the side of my house instead of towards houses.

i finished cleaning at around 1pm. ran to the bed in my room and just collapsed. 

at around this time the parents arrived setting the stuff in there guest room and mother-in-law (bitch #1), probably had the brilliant idea to make some food. mom (bitch #2) and kendra (nice bitch #3) also joined apparently.

so. i fucking woke up to fire alarms and tons of smoke coming into the room. at this point i was worried they burned my apartment down. i looked out the window saw people outside looking at the smoke. i immediately grabbed my laptop, phone, wallet, and fire proof case and ran to the living. when i looked at all three of them they were just laughing at the burned food on the skillet (was around 6pm by now). i immediately threw them out of the house, gave them my car keys so i don't have to look at for the next hour while i, i, i cook a nice meal.

this fuck up revolved over a 72 hour period. i got my first job at a day camp last summer and parties were held about 2-3 times a week. near the end of the summer a camping trip was organized for all the monitors. it was basically an excuse to go drinking all weekend. not that this bothered me. anyway, throughout the weekend i was eating junk food in between beers. i ended up drinking a case of 24 during this weekend without taking a single shit. when i got home on the sunday evening i was pretty constipated. on the next day i still had yet to take a dump but i could feel something brewing deep inside of me. at the end of my shift i had to put away some barriers used to block a part of the parking lot and protect the kids. i had been fine up until this point but having to bend over repeatedly was putting enormous amounts of pressure on my bung hole. as i put the last barrier on the cart my asshole could take no more and let out a flash flood of liquid shit. i left everything where it was and walked away with diarrhea rolling down my leg. i started to panic knowing that people would come out any minute so i akwardly ran back to the carts with the barriers and pushed it towards where it needed to be put away and then ran like a mad man into some bushes on the other side of a fence. thankfully it started pouring rain right as people started coming outside which cleaned me off and washed away some of the pools of shit in the parking lot. once the rain stopped people started coming back outside. not wanting to have to explain what just happened i decided to wait in the bushes for over an hour and a half. after that i went stealth mode and was taking every route i could that would keep me from having any human contact.

i did a pretty bad job at explaining what happened but i hope some of you will have a good laugh.

input: Text: throwaway account because my primary account is somewhat known in the community. so this happened last night, i went out bar hopping with a few good buddies i haven't seen in a while. for some context, i'm a married 33yo male. i barely even go out to bars anymore because i'm very devoted to my work and well...i'm married. but i thought the opportunity was too rare to pass up. so we're at this cool saloon themed bar, i'm hanging out playing pool with my buddies having good old fashioned guy time. i notice this cute little brunette keeps eyeballing me, and actually eventually comes up and talks to me. we literally exchange 3 sentences before i hear a ""oh hell no"" loudly in the distance. i turn and to my horror see this fucking monstrosity of a man (i would gauge him around 6'-8"" to 6'-9"" and beefy) rushing up to me. there was nothing i could do, i was pinned against the pool table and gawking in fear. he grabs me by the neck with his giant hand, and picks me up...one handed. bear in mind, i'm 5'-6"" and roughly 145lbs. i'm a small guy but never in my life have a felt so insignificant. so i'm sitting there confused, dangling in the air, and spits in at me ""you stay the fuck away from my girlfriend"" and drops me to the ground where i collapse like a ragdoll. angry, embarrassed, and drunk, i stand up and has he's walking away i say ""whatever, just keeping walking, guy"". the moment those words left my mouth i was regretful. but the moment he turned around and stared me directly in the eyes i knew i had royally fucked up. he started rushing towards me again, i tried to turn around to run but he grabbed me from behind, picked me up onto his shoulders and slammed me through one of the bar tables in one pretty well coordinated motion. the result probably looked a little something like [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=slammed+through+table&biw=1280&bih=631&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=x&ved=0cacq_auoamovchmi_7i3qtuvyaivec-ich0ahqdz#imgrc=iqorant41zsqzm%3a). i sat there in a pile of rubble, staring up to the ceiling, thinking why me god? buddies picked me up and took me home, offered to take me to the hospital but it was surprisingly painless at the time. so yea, my little man syndrome got the best of me at that moment. the pain just now hitting me this morning, my body aches and i think my tailbone might be bruised.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened last night; but i was sobbing too hard to even consider posting about this then. i suppose the fuck up is still technically ongoing, though.

a little background on me --- i have a rare cerebrospinal fluid disorder that manifested when i was nineteen. i've had 16+ brain and spine surgeries to treat it and i'll likely have more in the future. i had two last year alone which required them to shave out bigger portions of my hair than they had in the past. i was distraught at the time and worried my hair wouldn't grow back properly. my doctors and nurses told me not to touch it at all for a year and to give it time to grow -- so i did. during that time, i felt really frumpy and unattractive. it was a big blow to my self-confidence; which isn't really all that great to begin with. 

but last week, i passed the one year mark! as such, i decided to dye my hair. prior to my surgery, i always had my hair dyed and it was one of the things i missed most. however, i've been going through financial difficulties ... so, instead of going to a salon, i decided to do it at home with box dye. 

this is where the fuck-up begins. 

i decided to go with a smokey blue-grey color and i got a bleaching kit to do beforehand. however, as i was doing the bleach, it seemed like i didn't have enough to cover my hair entirely -- since the side they didn't shave out has gotten really long and my hair is really thick. i went through the process regardless and -- surprise surprise! -- not all of my hair lightened. so, my friend and i ran to the store and i bought a second kit to touch up the places that needed it. while there, i also bought a second kit of the color because i knew i'd likely need it. 

we did a second bleaching treatment and it worked! then, we threw the dye on ... and ohhhhhh dear lord, it did _not_ work. it ended up way more blue than the silvery color on the box; and there were patches of my hair that just didn't take the color even though they were slathered in dye. 

at this point, i had already spent far more money than i intended -- and now i had to run out and buy two more boxes to try to fix it. since it ended up so blue, i decided to get two boxes of really dark purple, semi-perm dye from splat. i didn't really care that it wasn't the color i originally wanted -- i just _need_ my hair to be one uniform color, you know? 

so, i start putting it on and ... guys? the dye stains everything. if even a drop touches something, it stains immediately and is hell to get out. it's nothing like the other dyes i was using. i panicked and started trying to clean stuff up while simultaneously applying the dye to my head. while trying to clean, i ended up getting dye on my walls and floors and clothes and ... everywhere. it's just everywhere. 

but, with my friend's help, i managed to get (most of) it cleaned up and coated my hair in the stuff -- staining my ears, neck, and hairline along the way. but since the dye was so concentrated, i figured i was in the clear and that, at the end of this, i'd have uniform purple hair. 

nope. 

i washed it out and i still have a massive blonde patch in the back.  it looks awful. i spent the rest of the night crying until i fell asleep. 

oh, and i have a small chemical burn from all the treatments.

it was not larry. larry squats. larry squats a lot. 
this butt was soft like a pillow.

larry was not the only oompa loompa on stage that night.

input: Text: okay reddit, today, i fucked up.
little bit of backstory to bring context to my fuckage. i have recently graduated with an arts degree and moved to a city on the beach. yes, it has been fun and games but its also been finding a job for stable income and to fund said fun and games. being an experienced bartender thats what i start looking in, handing out resumes to bars, hotels and pubs like some crazy looney. i have still found myself 2 weeks in looking with no luck of a job. my housemates tell me that it takes time and blah blah blah, but i'm not satisfied at all. anyway one day as i'm driving home from a morning swim i see this big building that i havent seen before with a sign on the front that reads ""bar"".
yes, maybe i can apply there so i can finally pay my bills instead of relying on parents! i immediatly get home, wash the sand from my balls and what not, get dressed in a nice shirt and head there with a resume.
i walk through the doors with some nice butterflies in my stomach and ask the guy at the front desk after a nice chat if they are hiring.

""we are always hiring, man"".

score! he directs me to the office part of this big builing where i am met with some 50yo lady that looks like she hates her day job. she takes my resume and tells me to fill out a form and i do just that like an enthusiastic little puppy that just got a fresh toy. 
i fill out my availabilities and give it back to her, she tells me someone will be intouch soon. cool. haven't heard that before.

but low and behold, two hours later my phone rings.
they actually want to meet with me, they want to have an interview to tell me what i would be doing. fuck yes! i go to the interview and it all goes well. the guy seems keen on me working there! after some light pleasantries, a joke or two and straight up business talk he agrees that he will call me on wednesday (it was a monday) and talk about when i would start. now this is where the proper fuck up begins.
tuesday night, me and my so go to watch black panther. i put my s8+ on no sound with no vibrate, its the considerate thing to do at the movies (also people with crinkly plastic food, like chips, fuck you).
thursday afternoon, me and the so get back from the beach, i'm expecting a phonecall but we decide to get busy anyway. remember phone on silent? yeap.
while gettin' busy, my possible employer calls me... twice. (not a humble brag).
after the touchy-stuffy is done i look at my phone, a wave of nervousness hit me. oh shit. 2 missed calls and a voicemail. i quickly try to listen to the voicemail, yeap, its him telling me this ""hey grizzlymaye, its flobbybobby, sorry i'm calling in the late afternoon but if you could call...""

phone stops speaking to me...
he is calling me again!
i panic and try to answer, but my phone says its gone to 'busy greeting""?
what is that?!? oh no i missed his call, fuck! i try to call back after my phone stops being an idiot. no response. i try the next day. no answer from him? whats going on?
i sit down, call my voicemail setup to find this ""busy greeting"" and i listen to this said ""busy greeting"" and my stomach sinks. it must of been some sick joke 17 year old me was playing on present me because these are the exact words my ""busy greeting"" was.

""why you gotta call me when i'm fucken busy, god damn!""

i changed my ""busy greeting"" immediatly. i did not get the job.

input: Text: tifu is actually not 100% correct, this happened almost 2 months ago, i just couldnt write this here before...why? no idea, didnt feel like it.

im currently in my first semester on a german university, history and information science to be exact. 

im a 19 year old man btw.

first day, it was faculty greeting day, we were all inside a lecture hall, listening to some higher semesters talking about the awesome stuff at uni, about lecturers and whatnot.

after it ended everyone moved up the hall to the exits, big wing fire doors that are always closed, we only opened one of the wings.

everyone held the door open for the next to pass through, just some common stuff, eh?

a dude infront of the guy infront of me held it open, the guy infront of me held it open for me, i held it open for a guy right behind me. 

well, thats where all the magic happened. the dude behind me probably didnt feel like going with all the casuals through the right door, noooo... he decided to open the left one. 

so basically the door was not positioned into a fully opened stated anymore. the chain of door-holders was broken and maybe you can imagine how much those fire doors way.

anyways, the door slammed shut and i, who already went through it, could only jump as a loud bang cut through the mediocre chatter outside the hall. 

i turned around and saw a girl opening the door with a mad look on her red face. looking at me.

so, apparently the door smacked her in the face and the only thing i was able to say was:

""ouh. i did hold it open...""

since then i am known in the circle of feminists as the misogynist who hates women so much that he slams doors into their faces.

i didnt even say sorry.

i know i did nothing wrong, but i feel bad for pseudo-fucking up on the first day.

tl;rd

im a man who allegedly caused a heavy fire door to slam into a feminist's face.

/edit 1
thanks to lord_baldemort, i explained the feminist part a bit more.

obviously the girl who got slammed by the door turned out to be a feminist later. but thats not part of the story. they hate me now. i hope this is enough to understand.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this tifu happened last night. my room is relatively small so to optimise space my bed is the top half of the room (ladder to get up), leaving space underneath for a desk etc. my room also has two lights, one main light (wall switch) and one reading lamp, for the bed. when i go to sleep the routine is to stand on the chair to my desk, stretch up and i can just reach the reading lamp to turn it on. (the reading lamp is on the opposite side of the bed to the ladder, so it is more practical to use the chair method). then i turn off the main light, leaving the lamp on for me to get into bed. this allows me to skip the death-satan-horror movie creature period of absolute chaos as i try to scramble up the ladder in complete darkness to avoid shrek's goodnight buttfucking(among other childhood nightmares).

regardless every night i successfully turn on the lamp, turn off the main light and calmly proceed to go to sleep. yesterday, however, was a different story. yesterday i was wearing some loose-ish pants without a belt(mistake no.1). as i was performing the chair-light manoeuvre, and stretching to get the switch, my pants promptly slipped down to my ankles. surprised, yet unfazed i attempted to step down off the chair(mistake no. 2), however to my ever greater surprise, my foot didn't touch the floor. it was held aloft by the pants hooked around my other ankle. unfortunately i continued stepping down pushing me and the chair (via the one foot still on the chair) over the point of balance, to have the chair and my weight come crashing down onto a single toe.

now would be a good time to mention the i have had an ingrown toenail on the inside side of the nail of my big toe (i know, disgusting) for over six months (even more disgusting), it's probably been longer but i have lost count of how long, so six months is a rough guesstimate. whatever.

side note: i have had an ingrown toe nail before, you just squeeze out the puss, put some betadine (or other antiseptic) on the affected area and dada! back to normal. cut your nails flat next time just to be sure. on my special ;) toe i think the infection got under the nail? or under the skin?. something happened to my ingrown toe nail that resulted in my body shutting it off from the rest, creating a hard lump cyst thing. it really hurts whenever i kick it.

so lo and behold, the chair landed, with all its energy, on my poor, infected toe. all the kinetic energy of that well built, sturdy chair was converted into energy of deformation in my toe. so yeah my toe hurt a lot. a really lot. i had trouble sleeping afterwards becasue i had to keep moving my leg becasue the pain was real. it was a weird impulse the i couldn't keep my foot/leg still for long. like a hard-wired instinct that i couldn't ignore. have any of you experienced a similar thing? like the feeling of the pain creeping up your leg and you have to move it to distract you? eventually i fell asleep with a cold pack carefully nestled around the wound. but holy shit that hurt. i hadn't felt pain like that for a long period of time.

input: Text: this just happened at around 1045am central time friday dec 18th.

so i have been doing kegels and jelqing to try and increase my sperm loads and girth. i'm not going to humble brag so straight to the point.

anyway, if you don't know what jelqing is, its a sort of exercise where you massage your little gentleman to help increase the girth. look up levels, i'm not gonna explain those since they aren't key to this story.

so after about 8-12 minutes of jelqing at the base, i'm obviously not soft, but not full on erection. i think the slang term is ""chub.""

anyway, i figure time to change it up, i'm getting tired of the rolling motion, my fingers hurt.
so i grab my little gentleman like you may grip a golf club and proceed to squeeze with my palms...

this is where you need to stop reading if you just ate or blood makes you uneasy.

so i'm standing there squeezing it with both hands, letting the warmth of the shower water. then it happens. i started alternating my squeeze from left to right and i was going sorta fast. i must have been squeezing in a way that wasn't letting blood flow out because in my left hand where my head was, i felt some pressure underneath the head where the body of the oenis connects to the head. and i immediately knew what had happened. for a moment i was religious again. i prayed to a higher power that it was all ok. that it was just a weird sensation...

then blood. a lot of blood. it looked like i was kissing blood., not the watered down kind like it was mixed with urine. deep red, thick blood. whatever boner i had was basically drained in a few seconds. i was shocked and stared until i calmy turned off the shower and grabbed my towel. looked around for something. anything. i remembered i had gauze downstairs left over from an emergency room visit a few months ago.

i wrapped up my dick as best i could, got dressed, and headed into work. here i am telling you because i'm utterly dumbfounded on what to do. i'm pretty sure it stopped bleeding. so i'm just hoping i don't have to pee to much today.

i have to work a double so this is really gonna suck.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this fu happened about 15 years ago when i was in high school.

i used to post regularly on a message board for toy and comic book collectors. somewhere along the line, i made a joke about myself eating babies. i do not remember what the baby eating joke actually was. i do not remember the context in which said baby eating joke was made. all i remember at this point is that somewhere, somehow, i made a joke about babies tasting delicious and it got a pretty big response from the community.

a bit later i was contacted by someone on aim claiming to be from the message board, seemingly about matters unrelated to the baby eating joke. we discussed collectibles and, over the next few days, made a friendly agreement to trade some nerdy valuables (comics, i believe...my memory is hazy about the details). trading toys and books was a common thing on this board; there was even a popular forum titled ""trading/selling"" where users would set up these kinds of deals.

here's where i fu. i traded my address with this person, who said they lived somewhere in (if i remember correctly) south africa. there was nothing suspicious about this to my naive and trusting teenage mind. all i thought was: ""wow, this is so cool. it's amazing how the internet can bring people together!"" but before i could ship anything out or even verify the person's address, they sent me the last message on aim i ever got from them before they logged out forever:

""we'll see how long you can get away with eating babies.""

at that point i had completely forgotten about the baby eating joke i'd made and it took a few seconds to process what that message was talking about. then i began to wonder. did this person really take my joke seriously? did they just think it was offensive? did i do something to upset them prior to making the baby eating joke, and did they now see this as an opportunity for revenge? most importantly, what would they do now that they had my name and home address? the last question, in time, would be answered.

some time passed. i can't remember how long it was, but it was long enough for me to stop worrying about it. several weeks, months, i don't know. i asked a few people from the message board if they knew anything about the person who contacted me, but nobody did. the person essentially vanished and, over time, i more or less forgot about them.

until one day, when there was a knock at the door. i was home alone with my mom. she answered it and called me from my room, saying there was someone asking for me. i came downstairs and she went into the kitchen (she was still in her pajamas) while i stood at the door, and looked out.

an older man was standing there with a manila folder. the best way i can describe him is that he was *gray.* gray suit, gray mustache, gray hair. he said he was from some kind of agency (i honestly can't remember if he said fbi or what). he said my name and asked if it was mine. i said yes. he asked if i visited a certain message board. i hesitantly said ""sometimes"". he opened the folder and said my screenname and the date i had registered an account for the message board and how many posts i had made. i said ""okay yeah, i post there"". he then told me they had received complaints that someone at my household was harming children, and if i knew why. and that's when i finally realized what was going on.

i told him that a while ago i had made a dumb joke about eating babies and someone had contacted me saying they were going to get me for it. i said they tricked me into giving them my address and that i was obviously just joking about the baby eating and i didn't believe anyone could really have taken it seriously. he seemed to already have come to that conclusion himself and calmly explained that one should be careful what one jokes about online because there could always be someone out there who will take it seriously, and that he has to check on this kind of thing anyway. then he said goodbye and walked back to his car and left.

my mom asked me what he wanted and i kept my answers vague. ""he was asking about a website i participate in. it was just a mistake."" my mom told my dad about it when he got home and my dad questioned me too. i didn't want to explain the whole thing so i continued to keep it vague and act nonchalant, and they eventually shrugged their shoulders and we all moved on.

to this day, i still don't know if the gray man was who he claimed to be, or who the mystery person who tried to get me in trouble was, or why they did it in the first place. it's been 15 years and nothing else related to the baby eating incident has ever happened. i just laugh at it now and it's become one of my favorite stories to tell, so i thought i'd share it here.

input: Text: recently i was hired on as a sales lead for a retailer. the pay is okay, and the job is not too shabby when the line of work is considered. i’ve already become friends with most of my team, and this even includes the manager who holds a reputation of fear-mongering and hard-lined dictatorship within the store. frankly, i just think he holds everyone to a high standard of performance, and that he likes to acknowledge success.  



   to the point: my boss is redoing his whole house. this involves creating a brand new, state of the art, media room. fancy gadgets and shit. i live about a mile and a half away from him, he knows i drive a truck, and he also knows i probably have fuck-all to do on a tuesday night after work. therefore he logically asked me if i'd mind bringing his fancy 66 inch smart television - complete with wi-fi, netflix apps, and ear-splitting surround sound audio system - home? well, shit, boss. sure. we toss the television in the back of my tacoma and i start to follow him home. since i don't want to wreck the tv, i'm careful to drive the speed limit, i ignore the incoming texts on my phone, and i follow my boss from a safe distance. my technique is flawless. but then it happens. the most obnoxious commercial comes on for a local travel company. something about cruises to mexico, complete with the loud wailing of the ship's horn. it's unbearable. i need to kill it. i look to my radio and mash the cd button with the force and fury of a freshly castrated minotaur. i sigh relief.   


  **smash!** in my sudden and totally unnecessary frustration with my audio, i neglected to notice my boss had stopped at a green light. evidently, the car in front of him had decided it was the right time to take an unprotected left turn... without using a blinker. i ram my bosses honda into the offender with my full speed. i’m punched in the face by a canvas sack. the scent of firecrackers fill my nose. oops.  

  
upon reviewing the damage, my truck suffered a dented bumper. a crumpled fender was the final result for the transgressor. my boss? totaled car. his television? pretty glass shards refracting light over various electronic components inside the wreckage of what’s now a very expensive cardboard box.  


 
looked away for a second driving, destroyed bosses car. i'm taking tomorrow off.

input: Text: this happened in january but this still cracks me up to this day. to get the best experience from this story, know that i am a small female.

during grad school i spent three weeks in india for a study abroad trip.  we were staying in karnataka, but took a week long trip to kerala by coach bus, about a 12 hour drive. the bus was awesome, it had huge seats that reclined nearly 180 degrees, color-changing lights, blankets, and tvs. thankfully, our bus ride was from 9pm-9am there and back, so i could take full advantage of these seats and essentially sleep through the entire drive. all was well on the way to kerala, it was on the way back home that shit got crazy (literally).

before heading home, the group stopped at a street bakery/convenience store to grab some snacks. we had been eating pretty heavy food all week, so i decided to grab a handful of cashews, despite being warned not to eat street food. i get onto the bus and fall asleep. seven hours into the drive i wake up with a sharp pain in my stomach--it's an emergency. as amazing as this bus was, the one thing it was missing was a bathroom.  i'm now not only sweating because of these stomach pains, but there's no restroom, it's 4 am, and we're in the middle of nowhere.

bathroom stops weren't announced during this entire drive, you just had to get off whenever the bus stopped if you needed to go. thankfully, the drivers stopped within a few minutes. assuming this was a bathroom stop, i got off the bus...only to find a highway with completely dark roadside stores. i asked the drivers where the restroom was--they didn't speak english, but motioned forward. thinking that restroom had been a word so far understood throughout the early part of my trip, i walked forward. the more i walked, the bigger an emergency it became. within a few steps, i couldn't hold it anymore. i ran behind a building, spotted some bushes, and decided this was the spot. i started to pull down my pants, but of course, as if the situation wasn't stressful enough, i then fell into a ditch (4 am: pitch black out!) and immediately, the shit went flying. i rush to pull down my pants the rest of the way but it's too late. my legs, hands, arms, and pants are completely covered. i had some kleenex in my bag so i do my best to wipe up, but i don't have enough time or tissues. within 20 seconds of falling the bus on the street starts honking and driving away. i have two choices: get back on the bus covered in shit, or get abandoned on a random  street in india 5 hours away from my hostel.

i get back onto the bus. i had to crawl past one of my classmates to get to my seat. she immediately wakes up and the only thing i can say is ""molly, i just shit myself."" if you ever shit yourself in india, sit next to molly. her response? ""it could have been anyone. what do we do."" so i proceed to take a ""bath"" with hand sanitizer and wipe with plastic bags, change my pants underneath a blanket, and cross my fingers that no one could smell it.

i was somehow able to fall back asleep but was awakened again in about three hours, this time to another classmate begging the bus drivers to stop. the only other person who ate the damn cashews too.

all in all, had an amazing time in india and learned a very important lesson: when they say don't eat the street food, don't eat the street food.

input: Text: first of all, me and my parents never talked about relationships, girls, the body, sex, protection or similar. which is kinda wierd since i had a girlfriend since i was 14-15 years old. we never been very close and never hugs or say we love eachother and what not, just ""drive safe"" and stuff like that. at most.

it all started a few weeks ago when i went to an asian store to buy chopsticks. i wanted the kind you can use serveral times and not the disposable ones. i found a package with five pair of chopsticks for less than 50 swedish crowns, which is approximatly 6 dollars. i expected to pay at least the double so i bought them. also, the five pairs where painted in individual colours featuring ""japanese motives"" which i thought was kinda nice. i also bough some noodles, coconut water, japanese daifuku cakes etc.

when i arrive home and unpack the chopsticks, i notice there was the five pairs i saw in the store, but at the back of the package there was another set of five pairs looking exactly the same as the ones on the front of the package. i was going to my parents home that weekend so i thought i could give them to my parents since all their chinese chopsticks are crooked from being put in the dishwasher. i like to give away stuff so they are put to good use instead of just laying around, i need at most two pairs for me and my gf to use anyway.

this week i was sitting watching ""orange is the new black"" while eating daifuku with my chopsticks.i used the purpule set which i havent used up until now. when i have the chopsticks really up close to eat my daifuku, i notice that the robe of the japanese women painted on the chopsticks to be open. as i turn the chopstick around i see her full breast is exposed and they even painted the nipple. started to feel the shame spreading throughout my body of the scenario of my parents noticing the same boob as i just did on their corresponding pair of chopsticks.

input: Text: as i was scraping the last bit of coke off my glass table, lighting yet another cigarette, having just woken up after a forty eight hour party, i realized i may have fucked up. i don't think most individuals experience reality as a struggle to feel good, they mostly just do feel good and can focus on other things. i'm a pretty basic addict and i'm proud of that, keeping most of the more dangerous drugs away from me. that being said i'm still addicted to cigarettes, an alcoholic, and a pothead. after i finally crashed for a few hours and got back up remembering the coke on the table and otherwise continuing to feel the urge to elevate my mood i reached the conclusion that i'm engaged in personal chemical warfare on myself. i try to be good to me, but the variety of drugs available makes it a complicated dance, and i can't help but feel i went wrong somewhere. don't get me wrong, my life has been beautiful and full of wonder and inexplicable events that have been a joy to experience. i'm not sure if i would have preferred to be different than i am; more responsible, less chaotic, a career to provide for my legacy and family. but the thought is tempting. i spent a few minutes remembering all the ladies i could have managed to have a relationship with if i had the resources to constantly provide for someone other than me. most of them have gone away entirely, leaving me to the fractured reality that is my life. i haven't had a girlfriend in over a decade, only ever dating anyone in highschool, though i'm still young and mostly unconcerned. i believe things will get better, i just wish it was a less rocky road i had to travel to get there.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so this actually happened last night, throwaway account for obvious reasons, yadda yadda yadda...

so i got into bed, one thing led to another, and i started playing with myself. i'll spare you the details, but a few minutes later i finished and i reached over to my bedside table where i keep my trusty box of tissues. unbeknownst to me, i was actually out of tissues and i had nothing else to clean myself up with in easy reach. being the quick thinker that i am, i thought that i could just reuse a tissue that i had used the last time, and quickly reached down beside my bed to pick up the discarded tissue. without a second thought i cleaned up the mess i had made, and threw the tissue back down on the floor.

this is when i realized my mistake. i began to feel a slight tickling sensation on my stomach/crotch where my cum had just been, and for a few seconds i paid it no mind. however it quickly went from a tickle to a burn, so i decided to see what was wrong. it was dark, so i turned on my phone's flashlight, and to my horror, i saw at least 20 ants crawling around in my pubes/happy trail. since i have roommates, i had to muffle my screams of shock and horror for a few seconds as i desperately tried to get the ants off of my crotch.
now this is when it gets bad. realizing i couldn't get all of the ants out without water, i quickly threw on some boxers and sprinted down the hall to my bathroom. i started the shower and tried to scrub my crotch clear of the little devils, which took all of about 5 minutes. when i finally came out of the bathroom, one of my roommates noticed what happened and made a joke about making sure i don't shoot it all over myself next time, thank goodness he doesn't know the real reason i showered.

anyway, for the next 20 minutes i couldn't fall asleep because my dick still burnt, and i was scared that there were still ants in my pubes. this morning i had to figure out how to explain to my roommates that we have an ant problem, without explaining that the ants gave me a nice case of fire crotch.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so this technically happened last night, but i'm just now recollecting bits and pieces of last night's drunken stupor. 

anyways, so it was a pretty normal saturday night. my best friend and i are getting ready, we love to go out clubbing, typical girls hauling every item of clothing out and checking ourselves out before veto-ing it and trying something else. i was in the midst of doing laundry, so my options were a bit more limited then usual, so i went for every girl's classic: **the lbd**. perfect. it's one of my favourite dresses, i know it looks great, it's a bit short but whatever. then i decided *ouu, i definitely need some sexy underwear for this*, because fuck it, thats what girls do. 

after searching through my drawer, finding period panties, underwear i only wear with sweatpants, thongs i wear strictly when i know i'm getting laid…. and voila! find my favourite thong. it's just plain black silk, just very average and that's why i think it's so sexy. i usually only wear them on a special occasion, but it's laundry day. so i'm wearing my lbd and sexy black thong. i feel good. 

anyways, we go to the bar, pretty typical, do some stupid shit. we meet a few of our friends, our group of bar hoppers is growing and we're all pretty drunk. typical night. we live in canada, so last call is at 1:50 am (insanity, i know) and we usually head home around 2:30. we all want to drink a bit more and smoke some weed, so, **hey everybody, after party at my house!** we get a couple of cabs and wind up at my house. 

we're outside hauling on a joint, probably about 10 of us, when i realize ah shit…. i *really* have to pee. like really, really need to pee. but it's just a few puff puff passes before my turn in the roto, so i decide to wait it out. doing a bit of a dance, trying to not make it too obvious, the j reaches me, puff, puff, time to pass and i run into my house to pee. 

i head up a few flights of stairs,  hike my dress up and sit my ass down on the toilet to pee. *ahh…..* sweet release. i go to wipe and-oh god. i left my thong on while peeing. my sexy black thing is completely soaked in drunk piss. but drunken me is a genius!! well, at least i didn't piss my pants, i think, a costume change at this house would probably be noticeable. so i do the reasonable thing and slide the thong off and stash it in my laundry basket. 

i give myself a bit of a wash up, head back outside to round up my friends and play some beer pong inside. we get stoned, we get more drunk, we get pizza, everyone leaves around 5 in the morning, it's a pretty standard bar night. 

cue this morning (ok, we got up at 3 pm) and my best friend and i are recounting the night, laughing at the stupid shit we both did. then she turns to me, laughing, and asks where my thong had gone last night, because i was **flashing everyone my butt**. we were both screaming with laughter over it but in my head i was freaking out. where did my thong go?! i thought i had stashed it in my laundry basket, but my laundry basket is in my laundry room…. in my basement. so there is a piss-soaked thong hiding somewhere in my room, and i have literally no clue where i could have put it. hopefully i'll find it soon before someone else does, or my bedroom starts to smell like pee.

edit: i now realise this is more of a rant than a tifu. sorry about that.

i bought my first (used) car ever, so needless to say i was pumped. i had been anticipating the day for months, and it finally happened. since i'm still a teenager and live with my parents, it was pretty much a given that my car would be parked outside. living in the hellhole also known as the midwest, my parents were definitely not going to give up their garage spaces. in the winter i will try to get them to possibly reconsider.

so, my mom had been putting off getting her car windshield fixed for over a year, but she somehow decided that the weekend after the 4th of july was the best time to do it....... okay, mom. 

crazy azz lady coming to fix windshield flies up our long driveway like it's the indy 500. alright. maybe she thinks its the road...? then she proceeds to back her ginormous utility van into the side of my car. (oops) she was probably hungover from the weekend or some stupid shit.

input: Text: during my senior year of high school, the drama team decides that the school musical was going to be cats.  no one s really ecstatic about that decision, but we do it anyway.  i'm cast as rum tum tugger (""the sexy man-cat"", if you will) and received two solos and a bunch of ensemble work.  for one of my songs, i had to run into the audience of roughly 500 people and find some entertaining folk to dance with.  no big deal, right?  i'm a bit nervous though, cause like, who wants to dance with a fast talking 18 year old dressed as a sexy cat?  luckily, my first night is great and everyone dances with me and i hit the high note and all is good.  the second night, because of the first's success, i am confident that everyone is gonna jump out of their seat just to dance with me.  i run into the audience and see this blonde chick sitting down.  perfect, blonde chicks love dancing, right?  so i run up to her with my arms wavin and my booty shakin and i grab her hand to pull her up... and she resists.  i'm like, come on come on it's fun let's dance! and she is not budging and her friends sitting next to her are like give it up man and i'm thinking, ""wow. this chick is such a bitch and is ruining the whole number."" and so i give up and run to an elderly man across the aisle, but not before i realize that the girl has a broken leg, a massive cast from toes to upper thigh, and the whole time was trying to reach for her crutches underneath her chair so she could dance with me.

input: Text: this is my first ever post.
this also didn't happen today. this happened when i was 18.
i live in a desert, and we have months at a time where there is close to 0 moisture in the air. i have a routine of drinking a glass of water before bed so i don't wake up with my tongue glued to the roof of my mouth. i wake up if i need to relieve myself so this has never been a problem. 
one night, i had one of the most realistic dreams i had ever had. i was up in the mountains hiking and i truly believed i was there.
 i could feel the sun shining on me, the ground beneath my feet and could even hear birds chirping . i was incredibly engrossed in the dream.
i soon realized that i had a painfully full bladder. i happily obliged my urge and went to relieve myself on a tree. i remember the distinct and utter pleasure of my hot stream evacuating my body. 
out in nature, watering a pine tree, this was probably the most zen leak ever taken.
my bliss was short lived howehowever, as i felt an odd sensation in the back of my pants. i became aware of a hot, wet puddle beginning to form in the seat of my pants. i was confused, then the realization kicked in. shocked, i came out of my slumber and bolted up out of bed. 
to my horror, the front and back of my pajamas had been soaked, and a three foot dark, wet spot had formed on my sheet.
some asshole must have poured a bucket of hot water on my crotch while i slept.
 this was especially creepy because the door to my room was locked at the time.

input: Text: (made this with a throwaway account for reasons)

long story short, i fucked up about 20-30 minutes ago, losing my best friend (woman i love dearly).

to elaborate, this took place over the course of about a month and a half, maybe two months, and came to a head about 20-30 minutes ago;

see, my problem was, i fell in love with my best friend, however, there was a major obstacle that ""appeared out of fucking nowhere"", and it took her away from me. i fought so damn hard for her, trying desperately to remind her (through my actions) of why we were close to begin with, and so on. 

she dropped the bomb on me that he proposed, and it completely and utterly crushed me (i still can't stop crying), and because fighting for her wasn't good enough, or maybe..i wasn't good enough for her, i'm left alone, heartbroken, and completely devastated. resulting in having to push her away because i can't handle seeing her in the arms of another.

i don't know what the future holds, but after experiencing the death of hope, my outlook is rather bleak.

so, tifu by pushing my best friend away because i was in love and couldn't handle the thought of her possibly marrying someone else. fml.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: a little background: i'm 27, and have been in graduate school for the last several years. i just graduated, and my mom's cousin - let's call her carol, who is in her 60s, invited me in march to go on her family's vacation to africa. carol's family is very well-off, both her and her husband are successful and prominent lawyers. i am close with her children, my second cousins, and eagerly said i'd love to go. the trip begins in a week and a half.


a couple months ago, carol asked me to pay for my flights inside africa. this was about $1k, and i sent her the money - a little surprised but ok with it since the trip looked amazing.


then last night, she asked me if i could send her a check for the rest of the trip. i asked how much. she then informed me that i owed her another $3,500. that's like 7 months rent for me, and i clearly don't have the money. there was never any mention of the price of the trip to me at any time.


i was under the impression that when a family member from an older generation invites a younger family member who is a student on a family trip, that the costs of that trip would be covered - unless the costs were discussed beforehand. i guess not so much.


so after spending $1k on my flight from the usa to africa, then another $1k on my flights within africa - i had to tell her that i can't go and now i have a flight to south africa next with absolutely no plans once i'm there. 


thanks fam.

 



edit: sent this email to my cousin letting her know i can't go. 

carol,

after reflecting on our conversation from last night, i need to let you know that i can't join you guys in africa. our expectations were clearly not on the same page regarding the trip, and i can't afford to spend this type of money considering i've been a student for the last three years, and i don't feel comfortable asking my parents for money for this sort of thing.

this is very uncomfortable for me, and i hope this doesn't strain our relationship going forward.

best,
tripnomore

i work at a fast food restaurant part-time. a lot of nights i have to close and believe me sometimes it does get rather exhausting. most of the work load is left on the night shift people, so we have quite an extensive list of chores to have done by the end of the night, plus doing our actual jobs. 

it was just one of those nights, you know? everyone's tired, been a long day, been a busier than normal day and even had a few asshole customers. it was around 12:00 at night, getting ready to close and this man comes through the drive-thru. he orders a meal with a drink and my co-worker tells him to pull around to the window. just like any typical drive-thru, we make the drinks, we hand you the drink and the straw. well, my co-worker takes the straw, bites the top of the wrapper off of the straw, takes the rest of the wrapper off, sticks the straw in the man's drink and hands it to him. all-the-while watching her do the whole thing. yes, he did drink it.

input: Text: this actually happened today

a little context before i begin. i am a complete beginner at golf, and have been learning and practicing on the driving range for just over a month. to give an idea of how i play, let me tell you that hitting an aerial ball beyond 50 yards is a big deal for me. i know i shouldn't play at the course with such little experience, but i wanted to get a feel of the game.

today, i played my first game of golf with two of my friends (both much more experienced that me). on the first hole (a par 2), i managed to reach slightly outside the green after just 7 strokes. so i set my self up to chip the ball in the green with a pitching iron (at this point, it was well established among my friends and their caddies that i was a pretty shitty player) and take my shot, expecting it to roll a few yards ahead of me. to my horror, i make perfect contact with the ball, and hit the best shot i would the whole day. the ball went flying up and then swooped down, and hit my friend's caddy, who was standing right next to the the hole, right below the eye (ideally, he should not have been standing at the hole since he was in the way of my shot, but he, like me, assumed that i wouldn't be able to hit that well). fortunately, it was not a serious injury, just a little bruise. the worst bit of this whole ordeal was that some twisted part of my brain found the whole incident hysterical, and i tried to contain my laughter, while everyone else at the scene tried to tend to the injured man. i did apologise though.

(google if u want) it had been long enough to heal and begin having sex again. since it had been a while we were both really excited so when she pushed me onto the bed and climbed on top of me it never crossed my mind that her fishnet stockings could potentally cause a problem. a few minutes into it and i feel this horrible pain and i dont remember if i yelled or swore but it was instantly obvious to her something hurt bad. now guy or girl if you are on top of your s.o. and something you are doing causes them pain your first reaction is to get up and stop hurting him / her. which was the worst... i had to grab her pull her back into me and reach down to untangle my piercing. needless to we waited another week before trying again.

i start to zone out a bit and think 'i'll just email that cute video to my friends.' so i select the video, push 'share', and 'gmail'. it appears in an email, i set the subject as 'yawn' (because the kid was sleepy right) and send.

anyway, turns out the video is 38mb so scumbag gmail rather than tell me this just sends the email without the video. so my friends who are politely listen to this guy tell his story both go beep, look at their phones,  read a message from me that just says yawn with no other message, and give me a look. i just smile back because i think they have a video.

next day i get a message from the guy telling me i really upset the girl by saying her dad was boring, and it was super rude of me. neither of them really buy my explanation.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: tifu by almost killing my employees 

obligatory this didn’t happen today or yesterday, but all the way back in 2009. after my discharge from the idf in 2008, i flew to new zealand to become one of those annoying folks selling dead sea cosmetics in the malls. i was pretty damned good at it, too, so much so that the company i was working for decided that it would be a good idea for me to come back to australia for the 2009 season, only this time as a manager. 

the premise was simple: i was given a van, a trolley and 2 employees, and i was to travel up and down queensland, spending 3 weeks or so in small towns set up in small shopping malls, before i moved to another even smaller town with an even smaller shopping mall, and you more or less get the story. 

after 4-5 months of this, i was told by the head office to move on to mackay, a fairly large area, where i would set up in 2 malls instead of one. this meant that i would be getting an additional 3 workers. this also meant that instead of staying in a cheap motel or rental unit, which was good enough for 2-3 people, we were instead given a proper, 2 story house to stay in. best part? it was literally a 1-minute walk to the beach. 

and so, that’s exactly what happens. we get the beach house, i set up my stands in 2 malls, i get my additional employees, and all is good with the world. i should tell you about the type of people who sign up to work for these kind of companies. they are either ex-idf soldiers, recently discharged, or 18-19 y/o european backpackers running low on money that need a job so they can keep on traveling. in either case, they have very little contact with home, and i’m responsible for them. i’m not just their boss, i’m also responsible for their safety, i cook their meals, i make sure they don’t fuck up too seriously when we go out, basically i’m supposed to be their parent, even though i was only about 3 years older than most of them, and in one case, 5 years younger than one of my employees.

**now here’s where we get to the part where i fucked up:**

being that we had an awesome beach house, and november in australia is about as summertime as summer can get, on our days off on sunday, we would go to the beach and go swimming. we did this for 3 weeks or so, until one day, as i was driving home from the mall, i actually slowed down to read the sign on the side of the road [(courtesy of google maps)](http://imgur.com/awyk6fh). basically, we had been swimming in waters infested with box jellyfish, perhaps the most lethal (and painful) jellyfish in the world, during the season where they were most plentiful (october-may). to make matters worse, we had been doing this without any vinegar, not even in our house. if any of my employees had been stung, there’s a decent chance they would have died before one of us managed to get off the beach, let along run to a neighbor looking for vinegar, got all the way back and tried to rinse the area. 

needless to say, i immediately forbade my employees to ever go near the water again, and thanked about every single deity i could think of that i didn’t have to deal with telling my bosses and someone’s parents that i let their beautiful sweet little baby die because i couldn’t be bothered to slow down and read a sign on the side of the road.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened a few weeks ago. i was waiting in the security line in the airport and was playing a game on my phone to pass the time. now i had been traveling for over 24 hours with no sleep so i wasn’t exactly at my best. the game was kind of shitty but was surprisingly addictive and had my full attention, so i didn’t notice that all the people ahead of me had moved forward and i was blocking up the line. an angry old lady behind me pokes me and yells at me to “move it long.” still playing the game, i start speed walking to catch up the people ahead of me, but unfortunately i don’t see someone’s suitcase lying on the ground and trip over it.

now the real fuck up happens. as i fall on my face my phone slips off the headphones and goes flying several feet right towards a group of tsa officers. i quickly get back up, but to my horror i realize the game is still playing, except now over the speakers with the sound somehow turned up to max. a countdown in the game goes off and triggers the sound of a bomb beeping before it’s about to explode.

now shit starts to go crazy. being a dark skinned middle eastern man who had just thrown a beeping object into a group of tsa officers is not a good situation to be in. “hit the deck!!” someone shouts. people are trying to run away, but it’s too crowded and everyone’s shoving and pushing and screaming at each other. on top of it all, a baby starts wailing uncontrollably. a big fat guy beside me tackles me to the ground and starts punching me in the face, shouting “fucking muslim terrorist!” 

i’m trying to get the guy off me, everyone’s screaming and the baby’s wailing. finally that stupid game shuts off and someone pulls the guy off me. i’m taken off to be questioned and eventually released after two hours. at least i wasn’t shot, but now i’ve got a broken nose and missed my flight. and i still suck at that stupid game!

after making delicious stuffed poblano peppers and sweet potatoes (all using a fair amount of the hell salt). i decided to be an asshole and let my dog lick my ghost pepper infused fingers. nothing. my dog went on as normal and i assumed that my fingers were not covered in magma death oil.

i washed my hands liberally and started eating my lunch.

the food was awesome.

what wasn't awesome was when i decided to put my contacts in. what my dog didn't notice in ghost pepper oil concentration my left eyeball immediately recognized and i screamed ""oh fuck! ohfuckohfuckohfuck!"" as my left eye all burned with the intensity of a thousand suns.

after the heat in the left eyeball dissipated, i stared at the right contact lens like ""wtf do i do now?""

i decided i'd pony up and use my pinky finger to insert the contact lens. surely that finger didn't touch satan's seasoning. wrong. it apparently touched the most because it burned 100x worse than the first contact. i screamed again and dropped my contact on the counter.

finally, i just shoved it in my eye and sat on my bed sobbing until the heat in my eyeball finally subsided.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this wasn't today. but no matter how many days go by, i don't think i'll **ever** live this one down. 

my girlfriend, we'll call her jen (short for generic name), was amazing. fantastic in the body and looks department, at least when it came to my own preferences, and basically perfect in every other way. yes, i do have rose-tinted glasses on, but it was still great, no matter how you looked at it.

she had a tinge of emo about her, which i still adore to this day. just enough of the dark attire and 'don't give a fuck' attitude to be magnet in attraction, but not enough that it ever bordered on cringe or forced. she was quite physically outgoing, which meant -- for me as a bit of a shy guy -- i could just stand there and let her take the lead. and she was not only very vocal during sex, and i don't just mean loud as she would make it quite clear what she wanted, but also enjoyed it rough. for a guy with not much experience heading into his twenties, it was a dream come true.

as for why she liked me, i can only guess she thought i was adorable. and to some extent, a bit of a pushover, but even looking back, i would still happily do all the things she asked of me. 

anyway, one night i go over to her parent's place. from the *'please'*s and *'thank you'*s to the *'sir'*s and *'ma'am'*s, i'm on my best behaviour. her parents weren't bad by any means, lovely people, but considering i'm the one having sex with their daughter, it's was bit... yeah.

i'm usually one to wolf down food, but i take it slowly, careful not to slurp up her mother's spaghetti. anything that could be remotely rude, such as elbows on the table, i avoid.

after dinner, and thanking her mother for the amazing meal, i let jen drag me along upstairs. with a kiss or two on the way before she slammed the door shut. 

""condoms are in the drawer, i'll be out in a few minutes,"" she whispered, biting my ear and making my legs go weak for a moment. this was the first time we would ever have sex with her parents within the same vicinity.

remember how i mentioned she was a vocal one? but, as any guy in my situation would do, i started stripping down and getting ready. and almost needless to say, a different part of me got ready a lot, lot faster.

she comes out and pushes me onto the bed, straddling me and talking dirty. not whispering. talking loudly enough that if her parents were walking by, they'd have heard us.

to start, she rode me. and for the first few minutes it was going well. we switched positions with her face down and legs parted off the edge of the bed, and me behind.

now, i feel i should mention that i'm 90% sure she wanted us to fuck in her parent's house because of the nerves, because i was no where close to cumming. anywhere else, and i'd be on round two or three before she even came once.

anyway, we get on with business and a couple minutes later she cums. everything's still going well, even if i'm a bit tired and feeling a little sick. i chalked it up to nerves. oh, and when she moaned, she did it into a pillow, hard to hear that way. 

and then, she flips onto her back and pulls me over for round two. on her back, which means the moans are bound to be heard. 

*gulp.*

if she was taking advantage of a guy being nervous to keep fucking her, she knew exactly how to get what she wanted. but i didn't have the heart to speak up. then again, what guy's going to say, ""i'm scared that you'll moan too loudly and your parents will hear us, can you like, keep a pillow nearby to moan into?""

yep.

so we go at it, and she starts really getting into it while i'm slowly, and i mean really *slowly*, calming down just enough to enjoy it.

that's where the growling started. 

""harder!"" i went harder, biting down on my tongue. not the time nor the place to ask her to be a bit quieter.

""deeper!"" okay, so i'm average sized, but i did my best.

the cycle repeated. i'm starting to sweat everywhere. sweaty palms. sweaty forehead. sweaty legs. but by now, she's close and like hell if i'm going to disappoint the woman of my dreams. 

so i pound her. 

like a sprinter, giving it his all, throwing everything and the kitchen sink into fucking. my arms pulling, my legs pushing, and all the muscles i can consciously move to fuck her. i may be nervous and feeling a bit sick, but that never stopped anyone.

she starts scratching at my chest, demanding more. and i obliged, wincing a bit. not at the pain, i kinda liked it, but at the sheer volume of my voice.

and i start feeling a little sicker. please remember, at this point, i'm not super-experienced. and i simply chalked it up to nerves, even with my breaths heaving and chest rapidly pulling and pushing. like a sprinter...

she gets closer, i we go faster. she calls for more, i give. she basically screams shes cumming, and i give scrape the bottom of the barrel for whatever energy stores i have left.

the sick feeling magnified. i was starting to enjoy myself. she was cumming or about to. 

in waltzes my stomach to ruin the day. my mouth starts salivating like crazy, and i panic, trying to pull away from her. i didn't know why, not 100%, but some part of my body was screaming **'get the fuck off her'**.

she was having none of it, another growl and lurching off the bed to pull me back, not to mention the legs around me.

and... shit.

i opened my mouth to speak, only to find my stomach wanted to get the first word in. cue dinner all over her. face, breasts and stomach. and the worst part, this was as she was cumming.

open mouth, and...

i'm sure you get the picture. but hey, at least her eyes were closed. 

thankfully, it was a single spray. before she kicked me away, and i ran to the bathroom to let out another two heavings. 

my heart's racing and i'm a quivering mess. i just threw up on the girl of my dreams, as she was cumming, and she probably got some in her mouth. on her bed. did her parents hear us?

she came in after me, spitting into the sink and slamming the tap to full blast.

we didn't talk much. but we did clean up. i called a friend to pick me up, and went home claiming to be a bit sick. i don't know if she slept on her bed that night, or at all.

for a few days, we didn't talk. i did crack a joke, laughing quite nervously, about how i 'gave it my all'. from then on, we never mentioned it and continued like nothing had ever happened.

a few months later, we broke it off as i moved quite far away.

i was 18 years old at a house party during my first year of university. i was very inexperienced sexually. i was also fucking plastered on tequila. i sit down next to this girl who was by herself and start chatting about boring shit, what she's studying and what have you. i had pretty much never done this and was amazed at how receptive she was being. so logically i figured the next step was to makeout with her.

i basically fell into her forehead, both because i was bad at making out and the eleven or so shots of tequila. i remember it actually really hurt and probably hurt her too but i just played it off as casually as one could. hey guys, wouldn't it be cool if that was the end of the story? i bumped into a girl's forehead and that's it, story over, how cringey right? it's not.

after we've been making out for a bit i start noticing her lipstick is being smeared around her mouth a bit. now i haven't madeout with many girls so i just figure that's normal and continue. a little while later it is fucking everywhere. red lipstick on her mouth, neck, forehead, fucking ears somehow. so i'm really confused at this point and pull back so i can her her more clearly. then we both spoke at the same time.

i said ""i think your lipstick is being smeared around your face a bit""

she said ""your nose is bleeding a bit""

then we both just kinda watched eachother figure out what had happened. she reached up at touched her face and looked at her finger and her mouth opened in horror. i just couldn't move and watched her do this. then she got up and jogged to the bathroom, leaving me still sitting there, blood pouring down my face. i then notice it's on my shirt, pants and the carpet. i should mention now that i came with friends (which had since left) and the homeowner was a stranger to me.

so i have nothing to stop the blood except for my bare hand as i start running to find a bathroom. i find it but the door is closed and it's clearly occupied. i wait there for a couple minutes, holding my bloody nose, with people walking past me giving me weird looks, when i suddenly realize that it's obviously the girl i was making out with who is in there. i got terrified that she'd come out and just see me there, covered in blood and figured that was an interaction i wanted to avoid.

so i just stumble around this stranger's house, walking past hordes of people asking me if i'm okay and what happened. finally i find the kitchen and grab a piece of paper towel. now this is an emergency so i just roll a little piece up and shove it up my nose. i can then hear who i presume to be the homeowner, absolutely yelling ""who the fuck did this to my carpet?"" in the other room. i casually leave out the back door and make my way to the street. desperate to leave and never come back.

as i start walking away from the house, who else do i see but the girl i was making out with. i would have told you her name at this point but i never actually got it from her. lets call her mary. get it, like bloody mary. anyway, so i'm still really really drunk (and like 18 year old drunk) so i decide it's a good idea to approach mary and apologize to her.

so i go up to her and i'm like ""hey, i'm really sorry that i...bled all over your face. it was an accident. obviously"" not the most heartfelt shit.

she was super understanding. she was like ""no, no it's fine! don't worry about it! well, i should be getting home.""

now again, i wish the story ended here. but it does not. because instead of me leaving this situation relatively unscathed, my drunken moron brain was like ""oh shit, this girl is still down. maybe i can continue pursuing her."" and then i thought of the greatest pickup line ever.

and i actually said to her ""oh, are you sure that you don't want more of my bodily fluids in your face?""

and she just stared at me. there was a long silence. then i felt movement in my nasal canal. i don't know how often you guys have put pieces of kleenex in your nose to stop bleeding, but there's a moment when you feel the barrier start to give way. so in my head i'm thinking ""jesus no! the levy is breaking, my nose absolutely cannot bleed in this moment of silence."" if i had just said my terrible pickup line, and then a small trickle of blood just starts coming down my face... the thought was unbearable.

so i take this enormous, ridiculous inhale of air through my nose. i looked very silly. but i breathed in so hard that i actually sucked the paper towel up through my nasal cavity into the back of my throat and i start choking. like seriously, dangerously choking. i am absolutely coughing up a storm.

she then says something that confused me. she said ""you're not being fucking funny right now."" then i realized. she thought i was making fun of her. my coughing, with my hand covering my face, looked like i was making a blowjob gesture. immediately after asking her if she wants my bodily fluids in her face. so i start coughing even more, desperately trying to get this thing unlodged so i can explain myself. and i coughed and coughed and coughed

...and i puked.

...on her.

i puked on her guys. i mean not directly on her, but in the form of residual splashes. it was gross tequila vomit too.

i just said ""i'm so sorry, i'm so sorry"" and left the other way.

in the end, i did get more of my bodily fluids on her face. well more her shoes really.

thanks for reading.

input: Text: ok obviously by the zip disk reference this wasn't a recent occurrence, but back in roughly 1999 i used to work in it for a pc repair store in a small country town.

we had a client who came in fairly frequently and liked to chat with the staff, he was kinda weird but mostly harmless. he was kinda short, fat, always unshaven and messy, looked to be in his late 40s to early 50s but had what my 19 year old self at the time considered a smoking hot mid 20s something wife with 2 <10 kids. 

so occasionally i'd get called on site to fix things, set up dialup connections, whatever. this guy called me out to install a new zip drive as his old one had died. i drive out to his place and see his wife as she's leaving with the kids and follow this guy in. he leads me to his kids bedroom where i squeeze between a bunk bed and a small desk with the pc on it. next to it is a stack of zip disks and his broken/old external zip drive.

i install the new zip drive and he's sitting next to me the whole time, i grab a random zip disk off the top of the pile to test to make sure it's working and as it's loading up he almost shouts ""no that one"", as he does i see the filenames start popping up ""chickwithdick2.jpg"" ""hermaphro1.jpg"" etc. i go bright red and he goes silent. i quickly pull the disk out and go ""yep, all seems to be working well"" and quickly make my way out the door. 

what this guy gets off on doesn't really bother me, but the fact it all happened in his kids bedroom freaked me out...also i dunno how he scored his wife :)

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so, a couple of weeks ago, i was with some friends, whose names will be changed for this story. it was me, my friend histamine, my other friend satyr, and his little sister who he had to take everywhere with him. we decided to go get some frozen oven pizzas from a nearby grocery store since little caesar's (an inexpensive carry-out pizza place) was closed and the other pizza restaurants were too expensive. okay, but here's the thing... histamine and i have to pay for everything because satyr refuses to even attempt to get a job and caesar isn't old enough to get one. normally, i don't mind because i enjoy satyr's company.
well, we get to the store and start browsing the frozen oven pizzas. satyr kept suggesting that we get red baron pizza, but no one else agreed. i was looking for digiorno's pepperoni pizza with breadsticks, but all they had was cheese pizza with breadsticks, so i settled for a pepperoni pizza with stuffed crust. satyr was unhappy and said he couldn't eat stuffed crust pizza because he's ""lactose intolerant"". i settled for stuffed crust anyway because i've seen satyr eat ice cream, pizza, and cheeseburgers. caesar didn't want anything from the grocery store and only wanted restaurant pizza. but dammit, i was getting digiorno no matter what. histamine noticed this and stepped closer.

histamine: ""lunaticbynature, why don't you just get freschetta? it's just as good as digiorno and it's only $4.00!""

me: ""i like digiorno better.""

at this point, caesar got in front of histamine.

caesar: ""it's the same price as little caesar's! why can't we go to little caesar's?!""

histamine: ""they're closed, caesar. lunaticbynature, just get 2 freschetta pizzas! you can buy 2 for only a little bit more than one digiorno pizza!""

caesar: ""but it's the same price as little caesar's!""

histamine: ""they're closed! lunaticbynature, just buy 2 freschettas!""

caesar: ""nooooooo! it's the same price as little caesar's!""

a little background, caesar is stubborn as hell. histamine can't stand being challenged. their personalities cannot and will not co-exist in harmony. so there i am, standing as histamine, a 19 year old, and caesar, a 14 year old, are literally inches from me, shoving eachother back and forth, almost screaming while they each try to present their argument over the others. then they start grabbing at me, trying to pull me closer to them as if that's gonna help. at this point, it wasn't even about the pizza. it was a fight to gain dominance... a dick measuring contest... to see who would have the last word. keep in mind, this is all in public.

histamine and caesar overlapping eachother as they push and shove eachother around the aisle: ""just buy a freschettaaaaaa!-noooooooo, little seezeerrrzzz!-it's cheaaperr!-lunaticbynatuuuuuurreeee! little seezers!-only $4.00!-itz da same priiiiiiiicceee!-just as good!-as little seezeeerrrzzz!""

god knows how long this went on for... it felt like centuries. millennia... eternities. i was frozen in a state of disgust and disbelief as the scene played out in front of me. i can't explain to you how upsetting it was. caesar doesn't just raise her voice... no, if that were true, god wouldn't bestow mercy as it all would've been spent on making caesar's voice bearable. but no, such fantasies are for children. reality is dark and twisted... 
when caesar raises her voice, it becomes an unholy screech. you feel it slicing into your soul. you can feel hell and its host rising up to lay upon your tympanic membranes when caesar unleashes her horrendous screech.
at this point, my nerves were on edge. i was starting to freak out internally. i already don't like constant loudness, especially when it's inches from my face, pulling me closer to it. and the whole time, satyr was brooding down the aisle because i settled on the stuffed crust pizza and not what he wanted.
i could feel myself feeding off the dark side of the force. i felt the rage flowing through my veins. i almost drew my lightsaber and ended them then and there, but i decided against it (i wish i had a lightsaber...). finally, i spoke to histamine.

me: ""i'm buying the digiorno. you can buy the freschetta."" 

histamine agreed, but not after informing me once again that it would be cheaper to get the freschetta pizza. okay! problem solved! i didn't lose myself and force lightning my friends to death, but i was still reeling.
i offered to buy a 2 liter of coke and went up to the checkout counter with the pizza and coke. suddenly, satyr sets a large snickers chocolate bar down onto the checkout counter, accompanied by caesar setting down an orange crush. i watched in disbelief as the snickers and crush made contact with the rotating belt on the checkout counter. any spark of sanity was quenched and my world faded to black as i unleashed the full potential of my hatred. everyone died.

alternate, true ending:
okay, so obviously i didn't kill my friends. but satyr and caesar really did set items on the rotating belt without asking me, expecting me to pay for them. i don't know why i didn't say anything. i don't know why i didn't put my foot down. i guess i was just too exhausted. i didn't wanna have to deal with any more griping or brooding... or screaming... and so i let them...
i know... what an insufferable act of weakness and cowardice. 
i should've stood my ground and said ""put that shit back, you little bastards.""
but no... i became the one person i always frowned upon. like the father whose children are little brats because he's too tired and lazy to discipline them. not that i'm satyr or caesar's father, nor do i have such authority, but in the moment, when we were all acting like children, i could have been. but i relinquished the opportunity to help satyr and caesar grow because i was stressed out... just before i exited the store, i whipped back around and bought a pack of cigarettes. i handed histamine the keys and told him to drive. he complied. i climbed into the bed of my truck, isolating myself from my friends. shakily, i fumbled around with the pack of cigarettes until i managed to retrieve one. as i lit the cigarette, i leaned back against the cab of the truck and listened to the calming sound of the engine, trying to forget about caesar's screeching voice, but also feeling guilty for not trying to teach satyr and caesar that they don't get everything they want, especially when other people are paying for it... i felt like such a failure as a father, and i don't even have kids yet! so i drew my lightsaber and plunged it into my heart.


alternate, alternate, actually true version:
i didn't kill myself in the end.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i, a 30-something year old female, have been single and abstinent for more years than i'd like to admit. i had heard too many things about tinder, naturally i just had to try it. five days ago i joined just to see how bad it really was. in the many years of being single i've tried everything. being set up by friends (just because we're single doesn't mean there's a match), dating coworkers (don't do it), dating friends of friends (should have gotten to know him better), online dating of the okcupid/match/ eharmony/chemistry version. there were just too many games, and yes you guys play games. from the online dating batch, one guy for some reason kept wanting to hang out with me. after two weeks he bought me a bouquet of roses. because we hardly had an emotional history, my reaction was not as sappy as he would have preferred. he stopped talking to me after that and when i asked why, he said he wanted his fiancé back. fiance?!?! i had no idea he had one of those in the recent past that he obviously wasn't over yet. the last guy i tried dating i made it clear i wasn't going to have sex with him when he was putting the moves on me on the 3rd date. he got upset the next morning and said ""i just feel like you're playing games. usually when girls say they're not going to sleep with me i just have to try a little harder and the next thing i know we're having sex."" uh. that's a game, you freaking idiot. mind you, all the while, the only reason i want to be in a relationship is because you get to have way more good sex than when you're casually dating someone who you know doesn't give two shits about you. 

i was really frustrated by that last stint and i finally just said ""fuck it, if i'm ever going to get laid again it's going to have to happen with someone i meet, get along with, am attracted to, all this has to happen in the real world"". so i do, and it took two and a half years. i meet this really intriguing guy at a friends party. he's in the process of moving 6 hours away but is still in the area frequently enough. after a few months of getting to know each other and him seeming interested in me, i cave. i'd gone to his new city to visit other friends and we hang out for a night. we do it. it... only lasted a few minutes, albeit it was good, it wasn't going to satisfy my hunger. he comes to visit me a few times, we do it a few more times, and still... it only lasts a few minutes and it doesn't really feel like he's there. it felt like a job he had that he had to get over with. the last time we had sex he didn't even kiss me. not to get me warmed up, not a kiss on the forehead, nothing. no caressing, just bang bang bang sploog roll over. i didn't understand my reaction at the time, but all i knew was that i was literally sick to my stomach and couldn't stand being around him after that. i cut all contact without explaining why, because quite frankly i knew i didn't like it i just didn't know why my reaction was that strong. after some time away and some reflection, i realized the only time i've experienced that (no kissing/fondling/etc) was when my first boyfriend many years ago raped me. ok, not this new guys fault, yadda yadda, but still there was no chemistry there and it wasn't working for me although he is a good guy and has a lot going for him. 

so, that was three months ago and i still am just so freaking savagely hungry for a man, but i don't want to advertise that because i don't want to be seen as an object. five days ago i joined tinder to see what all the fuss is about. it seemed like an express version of ok cupid. at least people get to the chase and stop pretending they are into you and want a long term relationship. so on tinder i'm swiping left and right, there's tons of hot guys on here and there's hardly any info. height and a dumb link to their instagram profile and a quote or two to prove how cool they are. how do you know you'll get along? how do you know he's not a total weirdo? you just have to take the chance i guess. 

one guy said he'd recently quit his job to travel. i, too, just did that. i sent him a message inquiring about his travels. he said he was in the area fixing up a boat to sail south. i just came back from sailing down south! so, we met up for drinks a couple of days later. mind you, he hardly checks tinder so to me that was a good thing he wasn't all obsessed with it. we meet up, he's super cute and has a sexy brazilian accent. we both love the same music, couldn't stand 9-5 jobs, want to travel anywhere and everywhere. i drive him home, which just happens to be around the corner from me in a suburb of a large city (he rode his skateboard), and voila, i planted one on him and we start ferociously making out (i never make the first move). his caress is gentle, and his words were exactly what i needed to hear. ""oh my god, your energy! you have the best energy. i can feel it. you have a lot you need to release."" oh thank you dear hot brazilian man, thank you for feeling it and allowing me to be it, rather than ignore it and pretend it's not there. since it was 2 am, i told him i needed to head home but that i'd like to see him in a couple of days. we continue making out and even get interrupted by a security guard for not being parked while in the parking lot. it's like i'm a teenager again, and i love it. the carefree attitude we both had, it was great! 

even though i said i wanted to see him in a couple of days, i regretted that decision in the am. thankfully he was on the same page as me and said he could be over later last night. at midnight, and without even needing to down a bunch of liquor to ease the mood, he came over and gently took me in his arms and one thing led to another he helped me christen my new apartment all night/morning. i never ever ever get off the first time, or second or third, hell sometimes i just never get off with someone. oh god i lost track of all the orgasms i had last night! more than i ever have in my life in one session! we were both surprised. all we could say was ""damn! that was amazing!"" 

he woke me up before he had to leave and we did it one more time. i just deleted tinder because even if i never hear from him again i am completely satisfied with what just happened. i feel there's a lot of bad press about tinder, but if you're honest about what you want and look for someone who is made up of the same stuff you are substance wise, it's worked better than anything else i've tried to do in my 6 years of being solo!

input: Text: i'm getting a new sofa today. to get rid of the sofa we already had, my other half posted on facebook a few days ago asking if anyone wanted it. a colleague of hers, a nice polish bird, said she knew people who would be interested so we told her that if they can come pick it up on wednesday then it’s theirs.

so, wednesday evening rolls around, and two fella’s arrive to pick up the sofa. it quickly becomes apparent that, beyond “hello” and “thank you” these guys don’t know a lick of english, but i don’t really care since they’ve not come round for a chin wag anyway.
i help the guys carry the sofa down two flights of stairs and load it up in to their comically undersized car, as soon as we’re done i say “well, hope you enjoy it”, and again clock that they didn’t know what the fuck i said, so we’re all sorta stood around awkwardly for a few moments. i decide to take this as my cue to leave, say “bye”, but then i did something really fucking stupid.

i bowed.

i bowed like a japanese businessman.

i don’t know why i did it. never before in my damn life have i bowed. as my head was travelling forward to face the ground, all i could think was “what in good god are you doing”, but i was already too far gone.
things haven’t been the same since then. my so won’t stop giving me shit for doing it, she texts me at work to say “hahahahahahahaha”, and if i ask her to do anything she’ll say some shit like “i bow to your command”. we went to dinner with my family last night, as soon as we sat down she said with a massive grin “guess what crockeyrockster did last night!”. unfortunately they all seemed to find it as just funny as she did. going for a drink with some friends tonight, and she looks like a kid heading to disney land.

input: Text: so this happened about a year ago. i take online high school classes, which require for you to go to a building on our high school's grounds to do the classes there with teachers watching. the best way i can describe it is like a garage type structure that is a building all on its own in the coroner of the property, you walk in and there are two doors on either side, i was on the right. you get there normal school times, and me being the smart individual, i always ran on 4 hours sleep daily. so i brought a redbull in to keep me awake. sit down, take a sip and start working on my class. about 30 seconds later, i realize we have a sub, the only reason i realize this is because i hear her asking the teacher in the other room, (the main teacher), if i can have a redbull. she, being the bitchy person she is, says, ""no, tell him to throw it away."" so, me being the tired mofo i was, i yelled back no. she said i have to throw it away or see the principal. i get up, walk to the doorway, look at her and chug the entire 20 oz can of redbull while flipping her off. obviously i get sent to the office, and i had to wait for the principal. the bad part was that i can't deal with caffeine that well, it makes me very sleepy if i drink it fast. so i'm sitting in the office about ready to pass out, and here comes the principal. she starts asking me why i did it, you know the rules etc., and i just pass out in front of her on her desk. i woke up with the nurse, the local cop and the principal next to me with them asking me if i need an ambulance or if i have pain in my arm. my nose was bleeding and i got detention for wanting to be awake.

input: Text: so this happened yesterday on april 1.  my roommate is an extremely hardworking aspiring dentist.  he got into dental school not too long ago, which is extremely competitive.  so i thought a good prank would be to convince him that his acceptance was rescinded.
i crafted an email and made it look like it was from his future school and that they had found out damning information about him.  this plan was flawless because last semester we got in trouble for taking a table from a dorm and had to go to a disciplinary committee meeting.  my roommate had never been in trouble, so even this minor incident caused him much stress.  so when the fake letter from his school cited this incident as the reason for why his acceptance was being revoked, he was fully convinced.  i used a website that allows you to send an email from a different user name and appropriately titled it as someone from the admissions office from his dental school.  also, i included the dean's name and signature at the bottom.
i was in the room with him when he read the email.  i planned to let the hoax last a little while, but he abruptly exited the room.  next thing i hear is 30 min. later when our mutual friend calls me and says that he is on the phone with his dental school and trying to find disciplinary officials at our school to figure out what's going on.  i call him as quick as possible and confess because at this point its gone too far.  he made sure i was behind the prank while we were on the phone and then all he said was ""oh.""  i've called him multiple times and he hasn't picked up.  didn't come back to our room last night and haven't seen him today.

input: Text: this actually happened today.
 so about 3 months ago i deleted my facebook because i was annoyed with it. today i decided to activate it again to get ahold of a cousin from another country. 


so i log in and the first person i see is an old friend from high school, let's call him chris. i hadn't heard from him in years. last i knew he had married his high school sweetheart, after 10 years together. they were always the perfect couple who loved traveling and went somewhere different every 3 or 4 months. 


anyway, i post on his timeline without looking it over (first and second fuck up, should have messaged him privately and looked at his timeline before posting) saying something like, ""hey chris! how are you doing? long time don't talk, i bet you and crystal have travelled the world by now huh? we should meet for coffee soon!"" (stupid i know) i continue on to my original task of messaging my cousin then log off. 


a couple hours later i log in and see that a bunch of mutual friends posted to my original post and are having a conversation. i haven't talked to these people in awhile and we simply lost touch. i'm excited because lately i don't talk to anyone anymore.(that's why i deleted it in the first place) so i click on it and soon my excitement dies off. 


all the messages are along the lines of ""is this a joke?"" or ""siranal that's fucked up."" ""this isn't funny, i know you love being sarcastic but this is crossing the line.""  turns out chris and crystal broke up 3 weeks ago because crystal cheated on him with his best friend. chris has been extremely depressed and even suicidal. i didn't even know what to say. i just deleted the whole thing but did get unfriended by chris. i messaged him explaining the truth. he understood he was just emotional. 
but if i learned anything it's to just keep my mouth shut and no wonder i have no friends and lost touch with all my friends.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: well tifu, i've been browsing for a while, blahblahblah, first post ever here, blahblahblah, etc.

my story starts out at my high school. at nighttime our janitors lock the staircases to the hallways to prevent people from roaming too much.

now my school counselor comes up to me during school and asks if i can record for his college talk to the juniors (i'm a senior). so after school, at about 5pm, i go downstairs before the staircases are locked. i go in our media and film class and grab the camera saved for me. after heading back upstairs, i see our janitor locking the door behind me. no biggy.

so i take off my stuff, including my keys and jacket, and set up the camera to record, and it says i have 1h ½ video storage available. that's fine, i thought the meeting wouldn't be too long. man i was wrong.

this meeting didn't end. as the timer on the camera counted down from 5 minutes, i decided i'm going to need another camera. i go into the staircase to go downstairs, and hear a *click*. there's the door.  now i, thinking it a smart move, should go outside and check the other entrances. they're all locked.

i manage to squeeze my way into one of the staircases (a glitch in the matrix). i decided now's the time to call my counselor, still in the meeting, and have him open the door. nope. his phone's off. i proceeded to go outside and check to make sure the cars are still there, and do this every 15 minutes. finally some of the cars start disappearing, so i headed to the front door, and low and behold, there's someone by the door! made it back inside in time to pick up my stuff and leave.

if there's any confusion, just comment below and i'll edit the op. (this was posted from my phone)

i have recently restarted my life and crossed the country to do so. i've been living on 6 months' saving after breaking even of debt just before that, and to that end, i'm functionally broke now while still trying to find a job (i'm holding out another month before regrouping at my previous situation). 

but anyway, a month ago i actually did the move. the drive was 42 hours, and one of the nights i stopped with my grandparents. it was a very nice visit, and i heralded in the new year by going to bed at 10:30 when my grandparents decided the lights should be out. after lengthy and warm conversations, i eventually departed, with a super nice and thoughtful $500 check from my grandma. immediately after she gave it to me, i deposited it with my phone (on new year's eve...possibly part of the fu?), folded up the check, and tucked it away just in case.

a couple of weeks ago, i noticed it hadn't shown up in my account yet. up until i eventually called, i assumed i'd find it, but finally, begrudgingly, i rang my grandma, chatted a bit, and finally told her. she said she'd cancel it just in case and send me a new one.

today she calls to let me know that the check was cleared. i check my statement again. no money. my grandma now thinks that i'm trying to get another $500 out of her in kind of an idiotic move, but she already sent me the check and said i could take it if i needed the money.

 

1. tried to deposit a check via mobile in the middle of nowhere on a notoriously bad night for mobile networks
2. lost a check worth $500

3. didn't say something sooner because


apparently now somebody has stolen $500 from my grandparents, who now think i'm a skeevy mooch.

(i also havent had a phone for about a week as mine stopped working and i was waiting for it to be repaired) i made it home, grabbed my wallet and took off on my daughter's bike. filled up my gas can and went back for my truck, where i found two very upset police officers who demanded to know where i went. i simply pointed at the gas can and said "" to get gas"" . he yelled a little more and told me they planned to impound the truck. i've also been having battery issues and sure enough it wouldn't start. i cautiously asked for a jump to which he replied he didn't have cables. i told him i did, but no that would ""hold up traffic even more."" he preferred to have me wait for nearly two hours in my truck waiting for a tow truck. when he showed up i was informed i had two options. i could make a deal with the tow truck driver, or pick up my truck at the impound lot. obviously i took what was behind door number one. i was asked where i wanted to be towed and i just said ""off the road where i can find a jump start."" truck driver: ""is that all you need? i can do that right now no problem."" cop: ""no! he needs to get off the road now!"" truck driver: ""sorry man"" so i got my tow down the road about a block. cost $198. apparently it would have been about 60 bucks if the police weren't the ones to call. but the police station gets a cut. but hey, the guy didn't charge for the jump. i think i got a good peek into how some are treated once a cop has targeted you and you become an easy way to fill a quota. i believe i was treated and talked to this way because of how's my truck looks ( it really needs a new paint job) and it sucks because i've met so many cops that were very friendly and professional. and it pains me to think of how many people will have a bad view on all cops just from interactions with this guy, let alone others who have a weird superiority issue going on.

(i don't have a computer... for various reasons unrelated to the story). about 10 minutes later i realized i was indeed late as fuck so i jumped up, dressed, and ran for the door. as i was locking the door, i realized i had left my phone and wallet inside. so i ran in quickly, grabbed both and then drove like a maniac, and barely was able to park,  then run across campus, and make into the class room before the professor locked the door. i decided as i was sitting down to make sure phone was on silent, as this particular professor hates phones going off in class, so i pulled my phone out of my pocket and clicked the on button and began to turn down the volume but as i clicked the down button i realized there was some very loud and very erotic sex noises coming from my phone, and as i looked down i realized that the porn i was watching was still cued to my phone screen and that as i jumped up to get dressed i didn't close my web browser, just paused the video and then turned off my phone. so, yeah, everybody in that class got to watch some bimbo get railed by a foot long dong, on my phone, during class....

woman on phone: ...""i've never done a 5k before, i'm not sure if i can.""

me: ""well the 5k is actually a run/walk, so if you need to walk it that's totally okay too. it's also a great way to get into running!""

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened this past friday night/ saturday morning. 

i always been shy and depressed so talking with people is hard for me. even harder to talk with women. plus i don't think of myself as very attractive and thing women wouldn't be interested in my anyways. 

i am 25 and a virgin. i never kissed a girl or even held a girls hand before. so i figured i do what everyone seems to do in the movies and go to a bar and see what happens. i don't drink but i have read it can make you less shy and more out going. what could possible go wrong?

its friday evening and i decided to go downtown and find a nice bar with lots of people. got there around 6 pm and sat down at those stools at the counter. the lady behind the counter asked me what i wanted and since i don't drink i had no idea and just told her this is my first time.

she starts listing off bunch of stuff like beers, cocktails, shots and bunch of other stuff i really can't remember. i figured i would try a little of everything and see what i like.

i started off with a molsen canadian. one of the few beers i actually do know. tasted horrible, they all tasted horrible. but i kept drinking one after the other and just having random beers and shots and cocktails. after the 3rd one i felt a little sick and threw up in the bathroom. felt much better after puking. 

its about 1 am, not sure how many drinks i have had. i probably puked about 4 times and still have not chatted with anyone except the lady behind the counter who was the one asking me what i wanted to drink. i trip and my glasses get knocked off as i was making my way to the door. a woman picks them hands puts them on my face and asks me if i was all right. told her i was fine and just had to much to drink. 

we both head outside and start walking and she asks me where i was headed. told her i was going the skytrain to go home. she grabs my arm and pulls me towards her and wraps her arm in mine and said the skytrain is closed this late and why don't i just stay the night at her place.

we get to her place and as soon as we walk into her apartment she starts kissing me and i am standing there like an idiot. i never kissed before so didn't really know how to. she happened to guess what i never done this before so she said she would teach me. at this point i am getting excited and nervous at the same time that somehow i will fuck it all up. after some kissing she takes my pants off and i am already hard. she teases me with her tongue then proceeds to give me a blowjob. i take off her shirt and she goes back to blowing me as i tried to take off her bra. words can't describe the feeling or my emotions as it was finally happening. but it didn't last long as i had just managed to  take her bra off that i felt something run down my penis. i didn't realize what it was until the smell hit me. she had puked on me while giving me a blowjob. the smell and the sight of her puking soon took over me and i also vomited all over her head.

i pulled up my vomit covered pants and ran to the bathroom and quickly got into the shower. started to wash myself and my clothes the best i could. she having taken off all her clothes came into the shower with me and apologized repeatedly as i did the same.

i got out quickly, grabbed my stuff and left as she was still in the shower. its about 3 am maybe and since no trains were running i walked around in the cold, rainy night.

once i finally got home i quickly took another shower for god knows how long. luckily it was a saturday and my family was still asleep. went to my room and passed out.

i wake up to my phone ringing but i couldn't move my body. i just laid there on the bed with my eyes closed and a massive headache. my whole body was in pain. i eventually fell back asleep and just woke up few hours ago. i took another shower and when i got to back to my room i noticed i had about 4 calls from her and dozen or so text messages. i don't remember giving her my phone number so not sure how she got it. the texts all were basically her apologizing and wanting to make it up to me. i  have yet to respond and don't really know what to say.

 


edit: i was pasted out for maybe 30 hours. by the time i saw her missed calls and texts it was around 10:30 pm and didn't want to call her in case she is sleeping. pretty sure she has work in the morning. i do plan on calling her tomorrow.

also i left without saying anything because i never been in such a situation and was just overwhelmed with fear. for what, i don't really know. i never drank before and had no idea what was happening. i tend to over think everything. all i remember when i left was fear that this wasn't my house and i would get charged for breaking in or something. i really didn't remember much until i read those texts. i am surprised i even remember anything since i read drinking to much can make you forget things.


-- as for being confident, that was taken away from me long time ago. few years back i tried random apps to meeting people since it was easier for me to chat to people through text. i didn't get any replies for a period of few months. so i decided to simple remove my pictures and descriptions of me and somehow i met tons of girls on apps and online. how ever when they asked to see me and i showed them a pic of myself they stopped responding. not even gradually less talking over time, nope, just a dead stop in replies after they saw my pic. i don't know if its because of me being unattractive or because of the color of my skin or whatever. i simply decided to not show pics of myself and didn't say the color of my skin and just told them i wasn't ready. i figured if they got to know the real me things would be different. some pressured me and i just told them i didn't want to say. some where okay with it and others weren't. those that were, we chatted for months, a few even chatting online and text for years. after chatting with them for this long i thought they obliviously like me for me, why else would they chat with me for thing long? so i decided to tell them and what happened? the exact same thing that always happened. they stopped responding. for someone to throw away months and even years of being friends simply because of they way you look takes a huge fucking hit to your confidence. 

out of all those years of chatting, only two didn't judge me and still talked to me. and those two people i considered my best friends. those two gave me a reason to keep trying. they mean everything to me.

also i wasn't trying to hook up with any of them. just needed someone to talk to and from there see how things go. they all know i was talking to multiple people as i told them. i believe in being honest is one of the most important things. --

input: Text: i posted an item for sale in one of reddit's many trading subs.  buyer was interested and we agreed on the sale. 

i get pms before bed that they sent the money and i say great, thanks, i'll ship tomorrow.  never check paypal.  

wake up and do my daily balancing act (yeah every day i have to balance my shit) and realize my paypal is at 0.  shit.  they sent the money....must've.

start checking the pms.  message number one, sent from me, has the wrong fucking paypal address.  for some reason i omitted the last 4 characters of my paypal email (4 numbers) and just sent the first part.  i was really tired and out of it...my team was playing on the west coast so i was up late drinking beer the night before...had my yearly performance review at work that day...just wasn't with it.  i fucked up.

but this is where i really fucked up. 

sent the buyer a message.  ""hey yeah so i screwed up and sent the wrong address.  i think you can cancel the payment (i sent the wrong address 1 cent and it came back as unclaimed).  if you still want it send to this address instead.""

i paniced by sending that message.  one moment of clarity would have resulted in a successful transaction and a much less sketched out buyer.  if i would have done what i did below they would have been none the wiser and i'd have shipped the item and they'd be happy.

i checked to see if gmail had the address i'd given them available.  they did.  that's good.  get it set up.  try paypal.  yep.  success.  i'm actually kinda smart.  

there's no money though initally.  hmm.  of course we're doing reddit pms and the communication delay is there.  between the time i've asked them to cancel the payment and the time they get the message, my *new* paypal account has accepted the funds.  there is no cancel option for them.  buyer understandably gets freaked out.  calls paypal, files dispute.  money is held.  nasty pm sent to me.  etc.  

i try to explain it was an honest mistake and i'm not really a scammer just an idiot who fued.  natually i refunded the money and the buyer moved on.

input: Text: it's was a humid summer afternoon, and the sun beat down on me mercilessly. i was outside with my tank top on, manning  a brand new lawn trimmer for the overdue grass. suddenly the lawn trimmer jammed, so i lifted it up to see what the issue is, neglecting to kill the motor. i noticed a large clump of earth had gotten lodged between the wire. i reached forward to remove the clump, but my hand did not return in time. i removed the earth and suddenly the mower roared to life, making a sickening clacking sound. the blade whirred crazily, and i felt the blast of air fanning my face as the whirring blades spun in a deadly rotation. my hand, still held by the blade was unfortunate enough not to have been removed in time. the spinning wire cut through four of my fingers, like a hot knife running through butter. i dropped the mower and stood back in shock, as blood poured out of my stumps, (used to be fingers) like a leaky faucet. i fell backwards, and blacked out. when i awoke i was surrounded by doctors, who told me what had happened.  luckily my neighbor saw me passed out on the lawn, and called the ems. i now am missing four of my fingers on my right hand. when i think about the story, it still makes my heart pound and causes my palms to dampen. i'm ok now though. i try to live a regular life. will it ever get better? i hope so. but for now i'm taking it one day at a time.

i get on grindr and found a guy i met at the bar that was pretty cute and he invited me over to drink with him and one thing let to another and you get the story.  as i it was getting hot and heavy my nose decided to bleed, as we were making out, to be fair it was incredibly dry and i was dehydrated.  he got pissed and i stopped the bleeding... it totally killed the mood.  he now is accusing me of giving him an sdi which is bogus and i was flustered (and drunk) when i finally left after cleaning his floor a bit.  i realized i left my nice new shirt at his place - he mentioned it and said he would give it back but i'm doubtful for tomorrow.

so, here it is again... have you ever wanted to try something you saw on a porn? well, i did. my bf and i are physically fit, and it didn't seem like that big of a deal.  here's what happened...   
i've always thought it looked sexy for a guy to pick up a girl and hold her during sex. so, i wanted to try it too. after going strong for about 15 minutes, i asked my bf to pick me up, which he did.
but, i guess i didn't take a few things into account: 

1) how easily things pop out in that position (never happens in the movies);   

2) how worn out my bf already was;   

3) how far the nearest available wall space was from my bed;   

4) how slippery a sweaty body can actually be (even with fans).  

because, as soon as he picked me up, i started slipping down his body. so, i tried to crawl back up his body, by gripping tighter around his neck and waist. he tried to waddle over to the wall for extra support, but i guess i had a death grip on him. after maybe two minutes of struggling, he started swaying side to side. then, his eyes rolled back into his head and he passed out, with me still on top of him. i didn't know a full-body ""bear hug"" could do that.

he's fine now, but imagine trying to explain that one to the paramedics. if there's a next time, i think we'll just start against the wall. - yeah, tifu.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened last weekend. first post.

 
i've been dating my girlfriend for 7 years now and for those of you who are (or have been) at that dating stage, you start to get a lot of the ""when are you getting married"" questions. constantly. especially at weddings.

 
side note: my friend's husband's brother jack (long relationship explanation, i know), who is also the best man, was in an accident a couple years back that left him paralyzed from the waist down. his family has taken care of him since the accident, and as you can imagine it has been quite a transition and a blow to the family.

 
anyway, we're having a good time and partying like you do at a wedding when they call the bouquet and garter tosses. for those of you who may not know, any female not married usually goes out on the floor to catch the bouquet and if they do they're supposed to get married next. it is the same for men with the garter toss. my girlfriend doesn't catch it and everyone gives her shit because we've been dating so long.

 
now it's the men's turn. no fucking around. i'm going out there, and i am not leaving without the garter. i don't know why it seemed like it was such a big deal at the time, but i really wanted to get it. for the sake of chivalry? possible. some deep-seeded issue with my self confidence that i thought catching a sweaty garter would fix? probable.

 
all the dudes line up and the groom fires the garter in the air. it's headed slightly right. i have to lean slightly... boom! i caught that shit. i felt like the man...

 
until i look behind me. and lock eyes with the groom's parapalygic brother jack. and realize the garter would have fallen in his lap, and to everyone else it looked like i intercepted the garter from the wheelchair-bound best man at the last second.

 
i am pretty sure i will never be able to look at my friend's husband fred or his brother jack ever, and will cringe until the day i die thinking back on this night... the night i stole from a dude in a wheelchair.

so me and friends decided to go to a club we are all drinking and i am very much intoxicated at this point so we assume hitting the dance floor will be a good idea. the dance floor in this club is basically empty apart from groups of people huddled together. so me and my friends start ""dancing""(and i use the term loosely) next to a group of very attractive girls. now one of the girls starts backing up to me and grinding against me, so in my head i think ""wow this girl probably doesn't know i'm here and it would be creepy for me to stay here"", so being the gentleman that i am i move back a bit to give her room. noticing that i've moved she looks back bewildered and i mutter like ""sorry about that"" and continue my shitty dancing with my friends. a couple of minutes later she moves back and starts again. at this point i'm thinking "".. fucking hell how much room does this girl need!"" so i move back again and she follows this then happens a couple of times until eventually i get annoyed and say like ""fine i'll move over there then!!"" and walk to the other side of the club followed by angry and slightly confused looks from the hot girl and her friends.

my friends then advise that the girl was grinding me and trying to get me to grind back.. i have no fucking clue what grinding is but i imagine i would of enjoyed it if i wasn't so clueless.

input: Text: i'm still processing this just after it happened.

today was the day i was going to replace my old, broken couches with one single new one. i needed the extra space and having two broken couches was unnecessary since they're hardly used because of their damage. they were both also carried over from my old home, which i had moved from about 4 years ago. it was a long process, but both couches were now outside and the new one was inside ready to be moved into place. i was about to walk to my kitchen to wash my hands when i noticed this weird fuzz on the ground. it stuck out because i had just swept under the couches before bringing the new one in. i figured that i must've been tired and unfocused which caused me to miss it. since i was heading into the kitchen to wash my hands anyways, i picked it up to throw it away and planned to do just that afterwards. that was when i noticed something was...off.

the fuzz i was holding was hard. 

when i looked into my hand, my mind just didn't know how to process what exactly i was holding. it was a partially decomposed mouse with some bones visible. everything just seemed to be on autopilot at that moment. i ended up throwing the mouse away, thoroughly washed my hands and sat down to think about what just occurred. eventually, i came to the conclusion that what happened is over with and decided to post it on here. i still feel very disgusted, though.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: first day back to school from winter break.

initiate stomach ache due to stress.

i jog down the hallways of my high school in a hurry after getting my hallpass signed to go to the washroom. i am in a panic because of the massive pain crawling inside of me, so naturally, i cannot pay a lot of attention to my actions.

i run into a fourth floor bathroom, go to the nearest stall that still has a door attached, slam the door, undo my belt, drop my jeans and slam my ass onto the seat.

i proceed to hunch over, squeeze my face in pain, and push out shit into the water below me.

*plip plip, plop, pffffffff, plip*

in the middle of my painful shitting, i start to get a massive boner, because hormones, and to prevent my dick from touching the nasty insides of a public toilet, i readjust my seating to put dick away from the endless supply of sti`s

now you have me sitting there, relentlessly letting out a stream of shit, boner sticking above the front of the toilet seat, face sweating, and hands balled up, not to mention the terrifyingly horrible smell of diarrhea. i try to take my attention away from the pain, when i hear footsteps outside of my stall.

""oh for fuck's sake, please go, dude"", i think, but when i focus more on the footsteps, an odd smell reaches my nose.

""perfume?"" i thought. ""what kind of guy wears perfu-""

then it hit me.

**i was in a girls' bathroom**

i panic and try to stay quiet, so the girl would just go away, and i could finish up and head back to class. then i notice something missing from my stall door: **a lock**.

i hear the girl's footstep coming towards my stall, and in my panic, another wave of explosive poop starts making its way to the outside world.

so, just as that girl opened the stall door to take her own shit, she saw me, sitting on the seat, body glazed in sweat, boner sticking out, and simultaneously taking a massive wave of shit.

input: Text: first of all, congrats everyone. we just passed 500,000 subscribers! 

secondly, the two week temporary ban on self-defecation posts is over. when the rules were implemented, we talked about the possibility of having a discussion and then a vote on what to do about the genre. unfortunately it has come to our attention that this will not be possible. conversations with the admin team revealed that an unusual large number of alternate accounts were used to skew the votes in the initial post. there is just no way to ensure a fair vote in a sub this big. from comments in that post and messages to the mod team, it is clear that many users have strong opinions on both sides of the issue. the mod team has debated and designed this compromise:

* posts involving self-defecation will continue to stay banned; however, once a week, we will encourage self-defecation posts. future self-defecation posts will be limited to ""shat myself saturdays"" (courtesy of /u/eightnote).

* all other posts in the shit genre are hereby unbanned.

some reasonings behind these rule changes:

1. there is no way to hold a fair and honest vote. one of the sides could easily manipulate it.

1. the sub will continue to have variety and will not be flooded with self-defecation posts on a daily basis.

1. many of the above mentioned posts are indeed hilarious, and it would be a shame to ban them completely. 

1. self-defecation posts had an important role in the growth of the sub, so it is only natural that they receive their own day.

1. you cannot spell saturday without the word turd. 

1. apparently the entire mod team is 12 because we all thought that was hilarious. 

we hope that both groups of subscribers recognize the reasons why concessions had to be made, and we hope both groups are happy with the way we addressed various concerns. understandably, there will be some people who feel upset about this rule, we ask that you try to understand that, due to being unable to hold a vote, we had to somehow please both groups. we would love to hear thoughts, ideas, and questions about the compromise in the comments below. **we ask that you stick to the topic being discussed. off topic comments will be removed.** 

we will try to answer as many of the comments as we can over the next couple of days. due to our various real world jobs, it may take us awhile to get to your comment. we ask for your patience.

finally, remember to give op the benefit of the doubt. this is supposed to be fun, so no need to say how you think a story was fake etc. 


thank you,

at first, it was funny. the good bird dog that he is, he would chase that thing everywhere we shone it until we got bored. seriously... we would get bored before he did.

we are both really busy; so i would start to use it to exercise marlin. i could stand in one place, cocktail in hand, and run the dog ragged. i thought this cat laser was a godsend. this is where i fu.

now marlin chases anything that resembles a shining light. his dog tags gleaming in the sunlight: chase-paw-bite-bark. a reflection off of our cell phones onto the floor: he'll fly out of his chair and start sprinting toward where the reflection was. even a neighbor's headlight flashing through our living room window will literally wake this dude up and put him on high alert. he was never like this before i inadvertently got him hooked on a cat laser. now he treats any shining light like a fat girl treats cake.

input: Text: i work in healthcare and occasionally i have to draw patients' blood as part of my job. tonight, i got the call for a blood draw so i went up to the patient's room. she was laying in bed, her husband sitting next to her, and they were watching something on tv.

i introduce myself and start to get my supplies ready when the patient asks me if i believe in prayer. now i am a devout atheist, but i don't see any need to tell her that. i actually see quite a few patients who will ask me to keep them in my prayers or whatever. i usually just smile, say ""sure of course"" and continue about my business. 

but this time was different. this time the patient asked me if i would pray with her before i drew her blood. i reply, ""uhh sure, no problem"" but in my head i'm panicking. i don't know how to pray! do i have to bow my head? do i have to close my eyes? do i have to clasp my hands or can i keep getting my supplies ready? do i have to say anything?  so, i'm already feeling awkward and panicky when she starts her prayer. i awkwardly angle my head down as i continue to get my stuff ready. she and her husband have their eyes closed anyway, so they won't know what i'm doing, right?

she reached out her arm, and i grabbed it and slapped a tourniquet on there. it was habit. then i realize that her other arm is also outstretched, and her husband has grasped her hand. he's also holding his other hand out towards me. fuck. i'm supposed to be holding hands here, not putting on tourniquets. so i quickly take the tourniquet off, take my gloves off, and grab both of their hands. this is awkward as fuck and i'm trying my hardest to curb my nervous laughter. let us pray. 

she asked god to guide me as i utilized this skill that he had blessed me with. this almost made me chuckle, because i am not good at phlebotomy. i mean, i'm trained to do it and it usually goes okay, but it is definitely not a ""gift that i have been blessed with"".  she goes on for another few minutes, mostly praying for me to be able to get her blood and...i don't even remember what else. this whole scenario was new to me; i was just glad it was almost over with. but then, as soon as she stops talking, her husband starts up with a prayer of his own. more prayers for me, and some for his wife too. now he stops talking. fuck fuck fuck. am i supposed to pray here? can't i just drop their hands, draw her blood, and get out of here?  

i'm overwhelmed with nervous energy, and feel almost giddy. i simply say ""amen"" and drop both of their hands. i look up and they're both looking at me with a kind of surprised/confused expression. that pushes me over the top. the absurdity of the situation combined with the awkwardness and uncomfortableness makes me bust out in laughter. it probably takes me a good 2-3 minutes to get it together, every time i started to calm down i would just crack up again. meanwhile, they're both just staring at me. not laughing, not even smiling.

i incoherently mumble an apology under my breath, citing something on the tv as the reason for my laughter outburst. nobody says a word. as quickly as i can, i draw her blood and pack up all my stuff. still nobody is talking. i mutter a quiet goodbye as i leave. they don't say anything in reply. i know i'm going to get talked to tomorrow about this...

input: Text: this happened about a year ago when i first got my drivers license.

so basically me and my friend went to the gym, and since i had the drivers license and a car i was the driver.

i found his house with no problem, and with my friend in the car we were able to get to the gym with no problem.

before i continue on, it is important to say in my defense that his house is in the middle of no where.

after our workout i drop him off home with no problem and his house is about 15 minutes away from my house.  so i made a few wrong turns and i just thought ""ok no problem, just keep driving,"" i made a couple more wrong turns and again i thought ""wow this is so ironic i'm lost haha better use google maps!"" even with google maps i still made a whole bunch of turns and before i knew it 45 minutes has passed.

this point i was getting pissed off and decided to stop by a 711 and ask for directions, they led me left and i went left. . . then left. . . then left. . . then left until finally with some random luck i was on the express way.

this is in about the 2 hour mark now.

i thought to myself, ""oh this is the highway, i know exactly where i am just take exit (insert number here) and i'll be all good!""

i missed my exit and ended up deeper in the expressway until finally i ended up in connecticut, with my original spot being in new york.

i think this was at the 3 hour mark.

i was freaking the fuck out and was thinking of calling 911 at this point but somehow made it to new york.

however, i was in some weird ass government property and i was scared as shit and i already spent about 5 hours on the road, unknowingly missed my whole shift at work.

at this point i decided this was an emergency that i needed to call 911 for.

so i called the 911 operator, who rightfully so was laughing at my face and treating me as a dumb ass, but regardless the nice 911 operator was giving me directions back home like my personalized gps.

after about 6 or so hours i made it back home.

well, reddit, tifu pretty badly. it is now 10 hours post my absolutely stupid decision to root my phone and start trying to reload a different rom. 

background: i have horrible luck with electronics. i kill everything (not on purpose) and have absolutely no experience whatsoever with rooting and unlocking bootloaders and loading roms or using adb and fastboot. but, of course, i decided to jump right in.

history: i was really bored today watching my boyfriend play dragon age inquisition and was bouncing around on youtube. as it happens, i ended up landing on a video about converting my exact phone (htc one m7) into the rom for the google play edition phone. and, can you believe it? each video is only 6 minutes long. ""i can totally do this,"" i think to myself. ""it's a bunch of buttons and stuff. how hard can it be?""

well, reddit, apparently it can be hard enough to fuck everything up. surprisingly enough, i managed to download adb and fastboot easily enough and even got twrp on my phone (thank fuck for recovery options). i also managed to unlock my bootloader with no issues and even rooted my phone! i was on such a roll i decided to say fuck it and keep going: ""psh, that was so easy"", i thought as i basked in my technological abilities, ""i could be a computer engineer!""

then, i download android revolution 82.0, went into twrp and started trying to apply the new rom. and boy, did i fuck up. i got stuck in a boot loop and decided to wipe the davlik (sp) cache, cache, data and system again... 3 times. each time after the wipe i tried to reload the new rom to no avail... boys and girl, i soft bricked my phone (if not a hard-brick... oh, please, don't let it be a hard brick).

i then decided to attempt an adb side load to push a different rom to my phone, only to discover that my adb is no longer locating my device. i apparently managed to fuck up my driver, as well. 

now, i'm sitting in the bathtub, with my laptop on my toilet cover thing (no water exposed, no worries), trying to figure this out. i work in 5 hours and thankfully i work with developers, but i don't know how much they know about phones. i promised my boyfriend i wasn't going to fuck up my phone; oops. thankfully, i managed to shut off the boot loop temporarily by selecting shut down from that one white menu with multiple colors that has the android logo skating around on a skateboard mocking you, so i have that going for me (which is nice). 

i should really just keep away from technology.

edit: spelling and stuff. i told you. it's been 10 hours. i want to cry.

edit x 2: already said it'd been 10 hours. i'm going to use improper words in inappropriate circumstances because i'm exhausted. also, to note, i've been trying to flash a new rom over, but my adb can't locate my phones drivers... ugh. 

edit 3- 24 hours later: still in the boot loop, but i'm moving forward slowly. apparently, arhd82.0 isn't actually sprint compatible (whoops). i managed to place viperone 7.0.1 on my sd card from my computer hard drive and flash it from twrp. so, now i have an (inoperable) lock screen that forces my phone to reboot when ever i attempt to unlock it, but at least now it looks like an actual lock screen rather than the ""wtf-is-this-shit"" fest that it had been on arhd82.0. now to figure out the boot loop and find a way to reconnect to the sprint network... (no network connection. whoo.)

**last edit: well, guys, it's been a journey, but i got it figured out! i officially have my phone back up and running. the amount of help i received from the reddit community has been awesome and if i wasn't new to reddit and knew jacksquat about gold, i would hand it out like candy. as is, for all the people who helped me out (stillazure, specifically), thank you so much. your ruu idea worked perfectly once i fully understood what you were saying. i returned my htc back to stock, locked the bootloader back up and i'm done rooting it until i have a better grasp on what i'm doing. i'm getting my hands on a crappy smart phone now to practice on and would appreciate any learning resources.**


i love you guys <3

i purchased some shares (over 11,000) in a well known rural company about a year ago for a rock bottom price (they were about 11 cents per share) and was told to hold onto them until the price jumps.
i held these shares for about 6months and no change in price.
i eventually sold them to break even (or possibly +$5).
i checked the share prices today and they are at $2.50!!
if i had of kept them i would have had over $27,000!
this could have paid off a large chunk of my mortgage or paid for my upcoming wedding.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: like all great fus, this started several months ago, and i only felt the consequences today.

so, as you can probably guess from the title, i live in good ol' 'murica, the land of bacon and freedom. more to the point, i go to a public highschool. now, our summer break ended in early september, and i was promptly loaded down with copious amounts of ap homework, and competitive club test-outs on top of that.


anyways, back story time - i have a \*personal\* (take note) skype that i literally only use for talking to 3~4 friends. being somewhat paranoid myself, i never put in actual personal information, especially on something so informal.

now, onto the actual fu. in response to the afore-mentioned stress of my schedule, i decided to change my skype name, as i periodically do, to express my mood - ""rip school."" 

now, for those of you who aren't as caught up on the hip terminology of kids these days, the phrase ""rip (something)"" is roughly equivalent to saying the outcome of completing said event is going to be on par to the result of sugarless gummy bear consumption.
 
since every highschooler's vocabularly consists of copious amounts of sarcasm  and overexaggeration, saying something like ""rip school"" or ""rip my grades"" or ""rip english"" is something literally every single teenager would understand with 0 ambiguity as meaning ""wow that test was hard i probably bombed it,"" with milder overtones of ""sigh my gpa is probably gonna drop.""

fast forward  3 months: my friend loses his phone. at this point i am completely unaware of what is transpiring. some random stranger sees his phone, and turns it in to the office.  my friend goes to ask if the staff have seen his phone. they hand it back to him. now, between the time he lost it and the time he goes to retrieve it, i have sent him a skype message, unaware of my impending doom. evidently, the staff had pressed the power button to see the lock screen, since when they handed the phone back to him, they started questioning him about my username, which was visible as ""new skype message from 'rip school'"" (or something along those lines). not wanting to get into trouble for refusing to tell them, my friend told them who i was. and was given back his phone. an entire evening passes by uneventfully. 

this morning, i go to school as normal. math first hour - calc bc, and for once i'm actually understanding the concepts. i remain blissfully unaware of the oncoming apocalypse. the bell rings. i walk to the door to get out, only to see a counselor walking towards me. he calls me over, and says he needs to see me. we shove our way through the crowd of people and slowly travel towards the main office, making small chat as we walk.

upon arriving at the main office, we go into a room and sit down. the interrogation begins, and i still have no idea why i'm there. the conversation itself was really long and winded, but the gist of it went like this:

 ""so, do you know have any social media? say, a twitter or a facebook""

""no, i don't""

""what about \**pause*\* 'rip school'?""

it was at that moment that i realized the alternate possible meaning of my username - ""rip school"" because of a shooting -  but the true magnitude of it was not yet upon me. upon explaining the mistake and the colloquial meaning of the phrase, i was released to go to my 2nd hour after being told to change my username, burning hot with embarrassment. it was only then that i learned that a few days prior someone had tweeted that they were going to shoot up the school, and that police were still investigating to find out who it was.

0/7 with rice would not misinterpret again.

     after we finished burning them the fire began to go out so i began to look for something to burn. i then realized i could get some wood from the dead tree i my yard (which was surrounded by concrete).
     all of my friends didn't like the idea but i didn't really care. so i scaled the tree and got all the broken/hanging branches off. then i started to make my way down. thats when a branch broke out from under me. i then instinctively braced myself with my arms out as i fell stomach down. when i hit concrete i felt a snap. i quickly looked over and saw my arm was clearly broken. all my friends were freaking out and yelling ""call an ambulance he's bleeding"". i swore to them i wasn't bleeding and told one of them to drive me to the hospital. so one of them did. once i got there i was in so much pain. they got me back fairly quickly. the doctor gave me morphine, got an x-ray of it and began to look at my laceration which was in my palm. i told him it's probably just a little scratch from the concrete. when i moved my hand my palm was split all the way across. so the doctor had to clean it out and stitch it up before he could deal with the break. once he got the laceration stitched up he began to correct the bone which hurt extremely badly. it turns out that my arm was broken in two spots and my thumb was also broken. he then wrapped it up and told me i was going to have to have surgery on it. so i have to go tomorrow and schedule it. i had to explain to the doctors why i was in a tree being that i was a grown man. needless to say no more trees for me.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened yesterday, but as you'll find, i wasn't exactly in the mood to be posting afterwards.

in the second week of december, i bought my first car. nothing fancy, a 12-year old ford ka [(it looked pretty much like this)](http://www.pickypencil.com/uploads/4/1/6/2/4162067/4485628_orig.jpg).

i enjoyed the freedom that driving brings, and was getting to grips with how the car handled. even better was the fact that since i bought it in winter, i was getting some experience driving in icy/snowy conditions. all was going well with my little purchase.

that was, until yesterday. it was one of those days where the sun sits low, and reflects off even the slightest bit of water on the road surface. because of this, my vision was obscured as i was driving along, meaning when i saw a set of trees in the corner of my eye i thought i was about to hit them (turns out, they were miles away, but thats besides the point). i naturally adjusted my steering to avoid them, and corrected it to pull back fully into my lane. except, i was ever so slightly ambitious with the correcting, and bumped up onto the grass verge a little.

ok, maybe more than a little. a lot. a huge fucking lot. the next thing i know is, i'm flying along this verge at around 35mph, coming to a halt, about 20 meters along. *""at least i didn't hit anything""* i thought to myself as i get out of the car to see if i damaged the front end.

oh boy was i wrong. turns out, as i went up, i had managed to tear through a telephone pole. literally **right through it.** the remainder of the shattered pole, and the cable accompanying it, sat behind my car, while the stump left in the ground by it looked as though someone had taken an axe to it.

in the course of this, i obviously managed to ruin my beautiful car, rendering it useless for anything but scrap. what i purchased 3 weeks or so ago, for £800 got picked up as scrap today for £40. 

also, due to the fact that it was my fault, i'm facing a £200 and 3 penalty points on my licence. 


all of this could've been avoided had i been wearing sunglasses. folks of reddit, tifu.

input: Text: this one takes me back, probably the stupidest decision of my life. i was just a little kid back then, in the suburbs of houston, texas. i had a pretty vivid imagination and i was always role playing about being a ""soldier"" or a ""warrior"" or whatever. so this particular day, i was just playing in the back yard, pretending to be a ninja. coincidentally at the same time frame, i had begun taking kung fu lessons at a chinese community center. (as a clumsy white kid, i was the laughing stock of the operation xd) i saw this nice firm shoot of bamboo in my yard and decided to wield it as my weapon, figuring with my martial arts, i would do something epic. i proceeded to sprint at the garage wall, in a attempt to pole vault up the side with my flimsy piece of bamboo. (thinking back it really didn't make any logical sense) instead, as i ran, i fell over a rock with the bamboo still in my grasp, and borderline skewered myself in the thigh with the bamboo shoot, now splintering and a couple inches deep through my skin. blood immediately covered the area and i could feel the wood inside of my laceration. in all my pain, i was dizzy and disoriented removing the splinters from my thigh.
i could have never known that the damage would be much deeper. 

over the course of a week my leg began to swell to twice its size. it was like nothing we had ever seen. the skin became soft and malleable, almost like a memory foam mattress. you could leave faint white streaks on my leg by simply touching and dragging a finger across. on top of this it was heavy, uncomfortable, and an embarrassment to have. after speaking to several specialists, my condition was identified as lymphadema: a condition in which the lymphatic system fails to move fluid waste back into the bloodstream. i received that injury ten years ago, and must manage it through stockings worn daily, garments worn every night, and additional measures

we had just moved countries and my mother was trying her damn hardest to try and get me into what she saw to be a really great private school. she had me do a bunch of tests and interviews with the school in the hopes of improving my chances. as the process goes on she notices i had been writing a novel that she was really taken by and thought showing it to the school might sway them even more. so she comes to me and says ""hey thelastpanini bring me your novel i want to read it because i think the school would love to see your work"". i had made some recent changes to the book in an attempt to make it a bit more adult and mature and basically had the protagonist save a prostitute who i refer to as a ""working girl"" and in return she sleeps with him. i tried to emphasize how important it as for her to read all 13 double sided pages and she goes ""sure, sure i will"". 
anyways she reads it thinks it's great sends it to the school to be discussed at her next entry meeting with the principle. 
at the meeting the principle bring its up says how he thinks i'm mature and wrote the story well, but then brings up one he issue.
""he mentions the term working girl..."" the principle says.
at this point it's worth noting much read about 10 pages and neglected to read the parts containing prostitutes. 
thinking on her feet she interprets working girl as working women. 
and proceeds to say ""well yes i am a working woman myself"". 
the rest of the interview proceeds, relatively smoothly with that lingering bombshell.
she gets home and asks me about the term and i gracefully explain the prostitute situation.

input: Text: so...i love the movie 'v for vendetta'. as a film connoisseur, i believe it to be a masterpiece. early on, not too long after the film was released on dvd, my friends and i would get together and watch the movie (among other flicks), play video games, and drink. ya know. normal shit. sometimes we would throw parties and just have it playing in the background. we're just all fans of the movie. no big deal. 
anyway, after a while, we started making it an annual event. every november 5th, one of our friends would host a watch-party at their place, and we would all attend. i know. fucking nerdy. whatever.

this year, we weren't able to have the party on november 5th. our schedules were all conflicting, and the only time we could get around to making time for the party was new years eve. so we decided to combine parties and have it at my friends house. he wanted to show off his new curvy television anyway, so win-win. now, we don't usually invite a whole lot of people to our watch parties. not because it's a secret party or anything, but mainly because most people don't see drinking and watching a movie as a ""fun time"". 
well...one of my buddies has a female co-worker that apparently doesn't have many friends / much of a social life, and thought he would invite her to our party to be friendly. nobody objected. he said she would be cool and specifically asked if she liked 'v for vendetta'. she said she had never seen it but would love to. 
we decided we would start the movie at about 9:30 so there would be plenty of time to catch the ball drop at midnight. people started showing up to my friends house at about 7:00, which is exactly when i started drinking. one by one my friends arrived. each one that entered mentioned this girl that was coming, and in some way expressed their surprise that she had not seen 'v for vendetta'. by 9:00, i had passed the point of ""pacing"" myself, and had pounded about 8 beers. all of a sudden, my friend shows up with this girl. she walks in and seems quiet, but quickly relaxes once everyone introduces themselves and begins the small talk. 

well, the time for watching the film arrives, and my friend pops the movie in his blu-ray player. at this point, i get very excited- it's new years eve, we're watching a great movie on my friends new tv, and i'm drunk off my ass. so, instead of containing my excitement, i decide to start chanting a quote from the movie, ""remember, remember the 5th of november. remember, remember the 5th of november...."" i don't repeat the rest of the quote, just that- over and over, hoping to get everyone excited. my friends catch on and begin chanting with me. almost like a slow building cheer that the movie is about to begin. i know. fuckin' nerdy.
now, nobody told this girl that we were about to start the movie. we just started chanting in the middle of the living room -about 7 of us- in low, haunting voices, the same thing over and over.
all of a sudden, this girl bursts into tears. full on tears. not just a few sniffles and a tissue, i mean wailing. everything comes to a dead stop and she runs out of the room. we are all completely confused and quiet, and my friend goes to check on her.
she left the party. gone.
after having no idea what happened, we settle down and decide to continue with our night.
so, today, my friend wound up still having to go to work, and i texted him about the girl and if he'd talked to her. he said he had.
this was the text i received:
""yep. so, her father just died this year. i'll give you one hint what as to what day it was.""

input: Text: well not today, this actually happened on christmas day.

i'm a store manager for a grocery store. the entire store including our coolers and freezers are monitored by an alarm company, who will call if an alarm goes off for any reason. although nice to have, it's also a giant pain in the ass. i get one or two calls a week for stupid things, like high sensors in the freezers ever though nothing is ever wrong. christmas morning, my girlfriend and i are out at her mom's house for christmas about an hour and a half out of the city. now's probably a good time to say that the store is open 364 days a year. we close one day, and that's on christmas. i miss a call from the alarm company, and phone back about half an hour later to see what the call was. zone 13 freezer alarm, the same alarm i've been getting once a week for the past six months. thinking it's another false alarm, and not being in the city i tell the alarm company to ignore the alarm. i'm sure you know where this is going, but it wasn't a false alarm. all the freezers in the store failed, on the one day a year we close. any other day, this would have been caught in time and been able to be repaired. the next morning we are out $30000 in product. but hey, i haven't been fired yet so at least i've got that going for me!

merry christmas!

so i pass out on my friends couch which was good. only problem was at 6 in the morning. i was cold and there was a blow up mattress with some girls on it and a blanket. i am still drunk as can be and try to sneak in the bed for the blanket. the girls woke up and said this is our bed, the couch is yours. me being drunk and acting like a 2 year old was stubborn about the idea of i decided to mark my territory and pee on my friend's floor. 

i wake up later in the morning knowing i fucked up but i did not know to what extent till the girls told me. i can only hope my friends will forget about it before i do. lesson learned, set a drinking limit and be thankful i didn't take a dump instead.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: obligatory this didn't happen today, but 8 years ago, when i was 12. 

start off, my friend and i were the usual 12 year olds. doing dumb shit, shouting profanities at people as we ride etc, yeah we were assholes, but everyone has that stage in life (if anyone is wondering, me and said have been friends for 12 years, and still are to this day.)

so, to the magnificent story.

my friend and i, after a usual uneventful time at school, decided to hang out, as we do. we were playing xbox etc and wanted to go riding on our mountain bikes (we were so cool i know). i lived about 15 houses down the street from a local state school (australia, so it's a public school, no tuition fees) he lived around the corner (i was house #23, he was number #8) we leave from mine and had the plan of riding to the local skate park. we go through the school on our way as it is 40 mins longer to go around the school. 

we get to the school and there was a part of the school near the canteen that was super smooth cement (like smooth as a baby's ass)  it was wet from some rain earlier in the day and was slippery as hell. thinking we were in a tokyo drift movie, we started riding around sliding everywhere, falling off our bikes and having general fun. here is where the fu occurs. a cleaner  (janitor) comes out of nowhere and screams at us for making tyre marks on the cement  (from sliding around). he comes up to us and demands to know where we live etc..

my friend and i are shitting ourselves, thinking were gonna go to jail etc. start to panic. he asks my friend ""so where do you live mate, so i can tell your parents and the police what you're doin"". in a true bogan accent. my friend pipes up with the funniest shit (at the time) and says ""on the corner of suck my dick and lick my ass"". i fucking leg it without looking back, ditching the bike as i was already off of it. my friend ""attempts"" to ride off, i look back for a split second to see my friend mid air, upside down, with a broom handle in his front wheel. i laugh whilst running, which is harder than you think. i was long gone and ran straight home. 15 mins later my friend turns up, with a golf ball size egg on his forehead, i burst into laughter and he gives me my very own egg with his helmet. laughter ensued after and we still talk about it to this day, always laughing whilst trying to tell the story.

2 days later, police turn up to my house asking what we were doing that day, we own up because we honestly believed we did nothing wrong. he warned us about trespassing etc and that was the end of it. good laughs and serious consequences from both our parents (a flogging and getting grounded for 2 weeks)

input: Text: this (as you will see) did not happen today but a while ago. 
so at age 17 i was down on my luck, couldn't find the definition of self esteem in the dictionary and couldn't hold a conversation with someone without feeling intimidated by their success and my, lack of failures or successes. i was stagnant. so imagine my surprise when the most beautiful girl i'd ever seen saunters into my life vis a vis my new sister in laws younger cousin. i found this pic as a frame of reference http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/katherine_mcnamara_2014_%28cropped%29.jpg/340px-katherine_mcnamara_2014_%28cropped%29.jpg 
she's actually close to a carbon copy of her. anyways, my dumbass decides i don't give a shit about family ties and i start pursuing said extended family member. surprisingly she was quite friendly and we really hit it off and actually became actual best friends. this is when my nightmare began. so it turns out that the guys in my neighbourhood weren't blind and due to some common after school community program were very aware of my crush and how hot she was, seething however that she'd turn her nose up at them and not acknowledge them. so imagine their indignation when this goat faced loser is suddenly getting in deeper and deeper with her. i'm actually talking to the point that these guys were stalking her and me trying to plan elaborate types of revenge against her and myself. these included prank calling and harassing her at all times of the day and night, beating the shit out of me in the school locker room when the lights turned off so i couldn't identify my attackers, and pushing me down a flight of stairs. 
now you gotta remember, my self esteem don't amount to a hill of beans at this point so i'm willing to take everything and the kitchen sink to be able to talk to this girl. here's where i fuck up again. on my 18th birthday i decide that as a right of passage to adulthood, i'm gonna tell this girl how i feel! over instant messenger.... with my friend coaching me..... yeeahhhhhh
so of course the response is a soft no with encouragement that i'm still extremely important to her.  so naturally the anxiety of telling her this caused me to come down with a fever which took me about a month to recover from. anyway i get over it, but i'm still putting up with harassing calls from keyboard warriors and people who refused to actually identify themselves in the light of day. around a month later she does a 180 and says ""i love you"". if you were in the room you would have seen my head spinning on a swivel like i was in a road runner cartoon. i was so excited. she didn't like me guys, she loved me! finally everything i had gone through was worth it! all that pain and torture and harassment! after a year and a half of dreaming and wishing (take it as a lifetime) i got my dream girl! 
the relationship lasted 3 weeks. she got bored with me real quick, told me she still had feelings for her ex and suddenly didn't care if i was in her life or not. so now here i am, alone, depressed, and still getting harassed by her admirers. so a few months later one these trolls messages me and taunts me so i tell him to fuck off. and i tell him that i hope he gets with my ex because she turned out to be a terrible person and they deserved each other. and cue the revenge of the sith. my ex returns in grand fashion. taunting me and saying how disappointed she was that i wasn't acting like an adult. (this dweeb had sent her a copy of what i had said). so now i have my ex, her friends, her admirers, and everyone of my sister in laws family under the age of 25 gunning for my head on a stick for being mean to her. my sister in law surprisingly was a huge rock in supporting me through all this and trying to stay amicable with both sides. unfortunately now it's been a couple of years and im still getting some emails  and prank calls (no ladies and gentlemen, not from her admirers, but from my ex girlfriend and her family who consider me a monster for saying mean things about her) and am so viciously scarred from my first relationship that i'm actually terrified at the idea of being friends with a girl again, let alone getting into a relationship with anyone. ever.

* i had no desire to repeat this, and really don't like flying when i could drive the distance in less time than i could spend in airports. i had it in my head our next meeting was also in st. louis, even though now i realize my calendar has been screaming at me...louisville, ky. so, now instead of a leisurely 6 hour drive, i have a 10.5 hour drive...

when my parents came home my mum, who is also a nurse, told me to put my hand in cold water, then into an ice pack. ten minutes later, she put burn relief on my finger, then left to do some work. i, being an idiot in immense pain, decided to put on more burn relief because my finger was hurting. bad idea number 2. i pushed down on the tube of burn relief too hard and squirted it everywhere! i cleaned up my mess and put a band-aid on.

the next morning, [a blister had formed on my burned finger.](http://i.imgur.com/850vvtc.jpg) however, i became very clumsy and bumped my hand on a table by accident, causing the blister to burst. i had to put another band-aid on to prevent infection.

fast forward to today and i was in class, doing my schoolwork as usual. i was trying to do my schoolwork and listen to the teacher at the same time, but i wasn't paying attention to what i was doing and got a paper cut, [right on the healing burn.](http://i.imgur.com/w8iywdh.jpg)

i am a retard.

input: Text: as i'm writing this i'm now in a bus on my way towards my hometown as my mom asked me to go back this weekends. so as the title reads, today i fucked up for accidentally leaving my apartment key inside and locked myself outside my apartment. 

i woke up today at 2:40 pm (had a dota 2 marathon last night) and after brushing my teeth, washing my face and all that i decided to go get some food first before getting my shower. so i grabbed my wallet, searched for my phone that got lost somewhere on my bed and after i found it i went out straight away leaving the most important thing behind, my keys. now, all my friends are not home, its holiday and its just me, since i forgot to buy the bus ticket earlier so i am the last one who left the house. the funny part when i think about what happened is this. as soon as i locked the door and shut it off, i realized that its too late, i realized that i left my keys inside! i wish i could see my face at the very moment i realize that i fucked up. 

my bus is tonight at 10 and i still had 7 hours to 10pm. what did i do? i grabbed my lunch and after i finished i went and buy pliers to try to disassemble the door. i was so stupid for trying that. i know. but i was desperate. i shouldn't have done that though, i wasn't able to disassemble shit anyway. it was for nothing. and now i am not even sure that any key would unlock that door anymore. thats my second tifu.  

sure, i could always get in through the window, but i hate risking falling off from 17th level to ground level just to get inside my house, i hate to die for just trying to get into my rented apartment.

and here i am. on the bus, without bringing other clothes aside what i'm wearing right now, i left my laptop, my clothes, my keys inside, smell like shit for not taking any shower since yesterday, and whats worse is i'm not even sure how would my housemates get inside the apartment when they get back. not to mention that i need to pay for a new door knob. tifu, real bad. =(

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so, as a 17 year old girl who had never in her life done any type of recreational drug, i decided to experiment a little. at the time of this fuck up, i was dating a guy who used said substances gleefully and is the reason i did this. fuck up number one. 
so the story goes like this, friday night i pretend to be spending the weekend at a friends house (my parents didn't know about said boyfriend) and it ends up my b.a.t.t (boyfriend at the time) was having a small ""get together"" with some friends and his roommates. so after consuming a very decent amount of alcohol, all of the people there just start chilling and talking when my b.a.t.t decides to get the bong out and lit up. so quickly, some back story. i am a straight a student, class president, valedictorian kinda girl, i guess dating said guy was my rebellion, but i was also insanely naive. shortly after he lits up, the bong begins to be passed around the room and i decided, ""what the fuck, who gives a crap, i might as well try it"" and take a hit. 
i clear the bong, and then i die. i literally could not feel my lungs, my throat burned like a thousand fires and my head began to spin, i could feel my heart rate accelerate and my heart murmur rang in my ears.

this was terrifying. i didn't do stuff like this, and all of a sudden i felt like i was going to die. so most of you probably think this isn't a big deal, and in reality this wasn't the fuck up. it's everything that comes after..

so, as my head is spinning something else happens. all that alcohol i had consumed previously decided it hated me and i lost my shit. i was leaned over a trash can puking my guts up and crying like a two year old just wanting to sleep and never wake again. so magically (i don't really remember this part) i was brought into my b.a.t.t's room and crashed. 

the next day i was supposed to just have a day to recover and chill, but that is not what happened. i was awoken from my enhanced coma by my phone going crazy and i jumped out of bed. my manager at work had called me 12 times. i was 20 minutes late for my shift that i had no idea i was supposed to work. so i lost it, i had zero work clothes, and nothing to wear, but i somehow managed to find an old skirt and dragged my miserable ass to work. i worked at starbucks, and this was a 6 in the morning shift after getting shitfaced and high as fuck the night before. let's just say, i could barley stand, let alone make drinks.

i thought this was my punishment for doing something i didn't really want to and knew i shouldn't, so i took it, went home, and passed out after the shift from hell, but to my demises that wasn't the end. remember how i said i didn't have any work clothes.? well i didn't have any normal clothes either, and i smelled like party. i 100% looked like a mess, and knew that i was covered in the fumes from the night before as i was on my way to my insanely christian conservative home.

i somehow managed to sneak inside, shower, wash my clothes, and fall asleep with only marginal looks thinking i had been spared by the gods for my punishment earlier that day. yet, i was wrong. i was so so wrong.

after recovering from my friday night festivities i finished homework and got ready for school the next morning, not thinking a thing about everything that had happened. i was sitting in my college government class taking notes from my professor when i get a tap on my shoulder from the office secretary. she tells me to grab a pen and follow her.  at first i have no idea what is going on, that is until i get walked into the cafeteria and i realize what i had just been called down for. 

as i previously mentioned i was a good kid, i was involved in every activity i could, and i had never once been called in for a random drug test in all of my three previous years of schooling. that was until the first day back to school after smoking.. 

it was at this moment that i truly began to panic, i saw the forums lining the tables and the line of people at the bathroom and my heart sunk. i was screwed. everything i had worked for was about to get thrown out the window and it was all because of one decision.

in actuality, my sample came back negative, but i will never forget those moments. i fucked up that weekend, and it still haunts me to this day.

input: Text: i'm sitting on the green line in chicago, with a buddy of mine. we're at the train's southern-most terminus, which for those of you unacquainted, is in the heart of the south side of chicago. for those of you even more unacquainted, that's one of the dangerous sides of chicago. it's about 2 pm, and there are three of us on the train: myself, my buddy sitting across the aisle from me, and a third man siting near the back of the car.

we leave the cottage grove stop and begin the trek to the north side. the first few stops are uneventful. king drive, nothing. garfield, nothing. 47th, nothing. 41st.....something.

a man gets on the train. he's wearing 6 coats. i counted. he's disheveled and smells and has all of he hallmarks of a homeless man. but he was no man.

he comes up to me, looks me in he eyes and says ""hey man.....i'm an ***angel.***""

which prompts me to say "".....*what?*""

""i'm an ***angel***.""

this is not your typical panhandling. 

""ok..."" i said back, trying to make sense of the being in front of me. 

""take this coat."" he takes off the first of his coats and tries to hand it to me. ""this is a $500 dollar coat."" 

clearly he had picked it up for $3 at the good will.

""i...i'm already wearing one."" i say, gesturing to my coat. 

""this isn't *for* you."" he explained, with a combination of celestial grace and spittle. ""god sent me here to give you this, to give it to the first homeless person you see."" 

then i did something foolish. i tried to reason with an angel.

""well....you're an angel....right? why don't you do it?""

""that's not why i'm here,"" he said, ""god sent me here to help you do a good deed."" 

""look,"" i started, ""i'm going up to the north side, i don't know how many homeless people i'll see, i think someone else may be better served taking the coat, but god bless and...""

and at this point he pulled back his coats and showed me a steak knife.

""hey man. **take the fucking coat.**"" 

and i made a reasoned response. 

""alright i'll take your fucking coat!!!"" 

he threw it on me and ran off the train, getting on the next car attached. 

i'm freaking out. my buddy is freaking out. and that third guy on the train? laughing hysterically.

i asked him why. 

""you shouldn't have taken his coat."" 

""i'm not sure if you saw the *steak knife*....""

""naw, but i seen this before. he's gonna come back on this train and kindly ask you 'hey man, **why the fuck you steal my coat.**'""

and i said fuckkkkkkk thisssss. i threw that coat down and left the train. i decided i'd wait for the next one instead of seeing the angel again.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: (note:started typing late on the 25th, finished 1am on 26th. story takes place: late the 24th-all day 25th)

today i fucked up by asking out my crush.

some background info: my crush is way out of my league (to be honest we aren't even playing the same game) and she was in the process of friend zoning me. she is the basic high school popular girl and i am one of the semi-popular guys. i took all of the recent physical contact and lots of conversations as a green light to asking her out, while these were her attempts to hold me in the friend zone.

my night started with me not being able to sleep. i got on my laptop and got onto facebook, and checked her profile (which i do about 10 times a day). i am at a tough patch in my teenage life, nothing happening in the love life, and things are moving slowly with my friends (haven't hung out with them in a few weeks, and i'm basically only a web presence at the moment). i was getting a little down about how things were going in my life at the moment, so i decided to switch my attention to something that never fails me: the office. (the office is like a comfort food to me, i watch it very often, and it always can take my mind off of sadness or being unhappy. to explain exactly how sad and almost depressed i am right now, i will share the fact that in the past two years i have watched the office end to end 9 times.)

so i start watching the office, and in no time i get to ""the episode"". this episode is ""casino night"" in season two, the episode of jim and pam's first kiss. i watched this episode through, and i had already known it was my ideal situation to happen with this crush of mine. delirious at 2 in the morning, depressed with my slowly moving life, and full of confidence after watching this episode of the office, i decided it was time to make a change.

for almost two months now, i have had a letter to her in my notes on my phone. it was everything i have ever wanted to tell her about how she made me feel in general, and included my feelings that i recorded on the spot sometimes when i was with her. this letter was something i have always wanted her to see, and resembled the ""tea cup letter"" that jim almost gave pam, but took back discreetly at the last second, and ended up giving her years later. he took it back knowing it was the wrong time to give her this, and gave it to her exactly when she needed it. this is not how it ended up going for me. 

in my confidence and need for a change in my life, i thought she would instantly fall in love with me after seeing how she made me feel, and that it was the perfect time to give it to her because she happened to conveniently be online at the time. i copied and pasted this unfinished letter that i had drafted over the past few months, and i hit send.

it felt great to do this! i was at the happiest i had been all year, knowing she would feel the same way. this feeling lasted for just under a minute. her response to my letter was ""this is too much, i think we are best as friends."" this broke my heart. i had worked up a year's worth of courage for this, and my huge slump-breaking action only piled on to how depressingly slow my life is moving. i could only get to sleep last night knowing that in doing that, the hardest part was behind me, and i would be saved from being embarrassed if i had done it in person (instead of online while depressed and delirious).

i was so wrong in thinking i had saved myself from school-wide embarrassment if i had done it in person. my crush sent my message to some of her friends that night (i found this out when i went to an event and was mocked with carefully picked quotes from my personal letter).

well reddit, now my whole school knows the sentimental details of a relationship i thought i had, and the fact that in all my courage i was to scared to confront her in person, and i did it in an im. 

after all of this, i'm only left wondering:
-what do i do now?
-how can i escape this depression that grows with every day?
-what do i do to fix the lump in my stomach about facing my friends?

*(thank you reddit for reading this huge story ending in my unwavering depression. please just say anything in the comments, i could use any advice i can get right now.)

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: technically this was 2 weeks ago but i am still living with the consequences today.

ok so it started out like any other normal day, june 22nd, i was doing summer gym at my school, and if you don't know, it basically is summer school but for gym class (it's way more fun than summer school). we were playing volleyball, my team was losing, and as a pretty competitive person facing competitive people, you become very frustrated with you team and, more importantly, yourself. so, one of my teammates attempted to serve and didn't get it over. the ball came right to my feet and i kicked it really hard and hit a wall with accomplishments for our school's sports teams and almost knocked one of the things down. the supervisor was upset at me, took me out of the game, and threatened to give me a failing grade (spoiler alert, he didn't). later on, i had soccer practice, we were scrimmaging and i wasn't doing too well. i was getting nutmeged (that's having the ball go through your legs), pushed around, and missing shots on goal. my friend could tell i was getting angry, and he told me to punch him in the chest (which is a really bad idea because the heart can stop working). i go up to him, and punch him as hard as i could in the arm (because he turned at the last second), and i feel a sharp pain in the middle of my hand. i'm in pain and i go off to the side to try to heal it. 

later on after practice, i got home and i could tell this wasn't right. i couldn't do something as simple as opening a car door, and holding a fork without pain. my mom sensed the whole time it was broken, but my dad said it could be something little and going to the emergency room is very expensive, so they had me wait and see if it still hurt. big mistake. 

i had 3 days left of summer gym and i couldn't do shit during then. the guy who took me out of the volleyball game the day before was not buying that my hand felt like it was smashed with a hammer, even though all the other teachers believed me. four days later (we had the weekend off), it was the final day and to celebrate we went bowling. i bowled since my hand was feeling a little better, the possibility of my hand being broken was gone out of my head, and since my parents paid $5 i felt like i had to get my money's worth. the same douchebag thought it was weird that i was bowling with a hurt hand even though it takes someone with only two brain cells that i was putting pressure off of the hurt part of my hand.

i was having a physical two days later and my mom scheduled an x-ray for me. i do the x-ray (shout out to the lady who took them, she was hella nice), i get the results, and i found out i have a ""transverse fracture of the 5th metacarpal."" i couldn't believe i broke my hand over punching someone, but my dumbass (as if i couldn't get any more dumb) thought i could still do my stuff like playing soccer and (since i'm getting my license) drive with a cast, but not everything can turn out the way you want.

july 5, a whole 13 days after i broke my hand, i go to the orthopedic and she tells me my 5th metacarpal was bent upward at a 35 degree angle and i need a cast. she also told me that i can't drive, or run, which in my mind as a soccer player, meant no soccer. now if you're wondering why i couldn't play soccer like i was, she said it's because my cast exposed the top parts of my ring, middle, and index finger, and if i fall and land on those fingers, my fingers could be broken, or bent in have. 

now arises a big problem and an even bigger problem. i get my cast off on august 3rd. the big problem is that marching band practice starts july 31st and my director will probably be very stingy about this since i can't play. hopefully, in the best case scenario, he'll have me just march and not play since i can still hold my instrument. the even bigger problem is that tryouts for the soccer team is august 1st - 3rd and there is a lot of boys, especially freshmen, going out, and since the coach prioritizes freshmen over upperclassmen due to them being the future of the team, a sophomore like me who won't be practicing with the team this month is in jeopardy of being cut. i did tell my coach and he says it's ""not a problem,"" but he says that about a lot of things.

so my future is very uncertain right now and it's all over a stupid punch. wish me luck...

input: Text: two nights ago- i was drinking with a friend and decided that 3 bottles of champagne in the hot tub sounded like a damn fine idea. i got pretty fucking wasted & was an absolute pest. allow me to paint the scene for you. 


first- i refused to get out of the hot tub for a few hours- insisting that it was warm & i had plans to sleep there. 

second- i said that if i was given a popsicle- watermelon specifically- that i'd get out. i did not. 

third- i agreed to get out of towels were brought to me. once the were were brought i smirked and pulled them into the water. 

i was somehow convinced to finally go inside. i decided that i needed to wash off the chlorine. i ran a bath. 

my friend came to check up on me and make sure i was okay. i fell asleep in the bathtub wearing my swimsuit. the water was running and was about to cover my nose. i had an empty [cucumber bag](https://imgur.com/a/j85vs) on my head. (no clue where the cucumbers went/ were hidden.) upon being awoken, i said that i often slept in the tub and that i knew what i was doing. 
i do not & did not.


needless to say- drowning in a bathtub with a mystery vegetable bag is not the way i intend to go. it would, however puzzle people for ages to come. 


anywho, i don't think i'll be drinking that much again for a very long time. 


also- the cucumbers were in the bag the next morning.

input: Text: today i had the most expensive 15 minutes of my life. 


i work at a busy outdoor bar/restaurant, and today i was on a double (11-11) shift. when i woke up, i realized i had started my period, but had an inadequate supply of feminine products to last me throughout the day. so, once we reached our lull time, around 2:30, i took my break.


what i needed to do was buy tampons. that's it. there was a drugstore 5 minutes away, all i needed was 15 minutes and i'd be done. i left, and with almost perfect timing, i was back, and ready to work. i go outside, to see my entire section filled with people. a lot of people. a lot of people drinking a lot. 


turns out that in the 15 minutes i was gone, 30 people showed up at 2:45 on a thursday, ready to party. my coworkers tried to help me out by just acting on my behalf until i got back, but the boss ""wasn't sure if i'd actually be back in 15 minutes"", so he made someone else take care of them. 

an hour and a half later, their bill is $1000, and all i'm left with is cramps.

input: Text: i'm very shy and socially awkward. i try to be ""normal"" in social situations and my friends try to help me but sometimes the things i say come out differently than the way i mean. today was one of those days. it was the worst thing that has ever happened to me and i feel like never leaving my house again. 

i’m 21 and i’ve never had a girlfriend or gone on a date or kissed or held hands with a girl before. there is a girl in some of my classes that i like, she is nice and always says hi to me but i get so nervous around her i can barely manage to say hi back without throwing up. today i was at the campus print shop picking up the invitations i made for my cousin’s wedding. my family is culturally jewish, meaning we go to the synagogue for major holidays but we don’t dress religious or have a taboo against men and women mingling. my cousin’s fiancée is jewish like us so the invitations are written in both hebrew and english. the girl i like was also there and she came over to look. she said they looked pretty and asked if i made them. i was so nervous i couldn’t say yes so i just nodded. she read the hebrew part perfectly and i was surprised. i asked how she knew that. she showed me a small star of david pendant that i had never noticed before because i can’t look at her for long without getting nervous, replying that she is jewish too. here’s where i screwed things up royally. i wanted to pay her a compliment but i was nervous so i panicked. the other day i had overheard her telling a friend how much she hates her nose. so i blurted out “you have a small nose, it’s not big at all’. my horror at what i had just said dawned on me as i saw her facial expression change to bewilderment. i quickly grabbed the invitations and high-tailed it out of there. now i have to see her around campus and in classes for one more week this year and all of next year. i wish we were graduating now because it’s going to be so awkward. i just want to crawl into a hole and never come out.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: ""this didn't happen today"". i am new here, thought it'd be cool to share it here. brace.

i was an 11 year old kid back then and i liked to pet animals on the first sight of 'em (still do). my parents were making plans to visit the beautiful small village where my father grew up. to spend a few days and come back. my father warned me a lot about various short tempered animals and birds in there, especially swans. and of course little me didn't pay any attention. i was too busy to fantasize about the cows and goats and sheep (in a platonic way).

so there i was, terrorizing the whole village's wild life (kinda domesticated i guess). apparently they didn't like to be touched constantly by a stupid kid. by the second day every damn cow, hen, goat, and sheep was running away by the sight of me -praying for my premature death. the crows lost their privacy and peace. they all conspired against me and it worked.

on the morning of the fourth day i went alone to the edge of a big pond on the outskirts of the village and discovered one of the nests of some local swans. some (3-4) cygnets were playing around it and didn't mind me coming near 'em. one, especially friendly cygnet came near me out of curiosity and i picked it up from the ground in a gentle manner. it was chubby, cute, and warm. as i was looking over the pond while sunbeams touched my face through the red edge of the clouds - the swan mother arrived from the pond with two fully spread wings. i thought she was coming to congratulate me for being the new david attenborough / disney princess of the village.

the swan went straight for my baby maker and grabbed a mouthful with her beak. i've never received a blowjob till now but her job blew my fucking soul out of my body. the clouds turned black and the sun went dark. those who think nut hitting is worse than childbirth should try a swan sometimes. i was in great pain. her wings hit me hard on the rib cage and knees and the silly cunt cygnet enjoyed the whole show from my arms. after 30 or so seconds of agony and russian ballet i was finally able to disengage the bastard from my penis. i quickly put down the baby and ran for home.

my upper trousers were soaked in blood. my mother nearly fainted by the sight of me. i just told my father ""swan!""... he quickly grabbed me up from the ground and ran for the doctor's house. i got two stitches on my nutsack and one on the penis and lots of ointments for the bruises on my chest, hands, and knees. the doctor told me that the cygnet saved my face because i was holding it near my face. the mother swan would never attack near her baby. my right seminal duct was nearly chopped off but apparently my blood soaked jeans saved it. 

my asshole sister who never misses a chance, asked me after i came home from the doctor's, ""first period huh? tell me about it."".

turns out the week afterwards he found his inner fuckboy thanks to me and is pretty much now you're average lad.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: alright, so this requires a bit of backstory:
me and my friends have a term to describe ""gamer-cooking"", which is when you put something on the stove or in the oven and forget about it because you get busy with a game, namely: wow-cooking. none of us play wow any more but the term stuck as a result of many a charcoal dinner.

anyways, so this time i was sat here playing some game, and i work evenings, so i was up at 4am and i got a bit hungry. naturally i have a full stock of frozen pizzas and went on my merry way to the kitchen to put one in the oven, as one does. now i plant in my mind to set my phone on a 15 minute timer and start returning to my room, but along the way i get this terrible tummy ache, arguably the result of a solid diet of frozen pizzas and nothing for the past week. (i recently got single again.) so i rush to the toilet, do my business and return to my room to keep playing the game i was so involved in. mind you i'm also catching up on the latest season of supernatural in preparation of the new season starting soon. all good, right? i start a new episode as i sit down and watch it through and through. (mind you, these episodes are 45 minutes).

this is probably the point at which you might realize that i forgot to set the timer for the pizza. more precisely, this is the point at which i realize i'm a bit hungry, and i should make some f...oh fuck!

i run to the kitchen, burst open the door and see fuckall, it's basically like opening a door to silent hill. i can barely see anything. now, why didn't the smoke alarm go off, you might ask? well, this isn't the first time this type of thing has happened, so naturally i've unplugged it so i won't be woken up my my roommate in the middle of the day.

well, considering this is not the first time it's happened, i do what we normally do in this situation, crack open both windows and start venting out the room. my eyes are stinging like mad here. i open the stove and see my delicious charcoal frizbee dinner all ready and waiting for me. now i'm a bachelor and i've eaten worse things than charcoal with a doughy center before, so i happily wait for most of the smoke to clear and prep the remains of the pizza and bring it back to my room. i'm thinking all's good. put on the next episode of supernatural and start nomming away. 

about halfway through the episode my doorbell rings. which i find rather odd considering it's closer to 6am now, but i think ""hey maybe it's the paper guy or something"" it's not *that* unlikely in my mind.

i roll out of my chair and wobble over to the front door, i open it and in front of me are 3 firemen standing in full gear. two of them rush past me in to the hallway and spread out through the house, the last one grabs me by the shoulders and asks where the fire is in a fairly stern manner.

i, completely dazed by both lack of sleep and the situation mention that there's no fire, but i did burn a pizza 20 minutes ago.

the fireman calls back his partners and explains it was a false alarm. so i explain the situation to the three men and they chuckle. they tell me how they got a call about a potential fire and how it's actually a fairly common occurrence.

**apparently**, when you have smoke billowing through a window in the middle of the night some bystanders might walk by and think it was a fire, *who knew.*

mind you, i did actually forget that i left the oven on, so smoke was still building up while i had returned to my room. (yeah, we should clean the oven).

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: just after i finish having dinner, there's a knock on my door. i'm currently staying in a corporate apartment at a new job in a new city, so this is pretty unexpected. i open it and there's a kid there, maybe 20 years old, talking a mile a minute about how he's in some kind of contest to improve his social skills and win a trip and fund his education and a whole bunch of other obvious bullshit.

as he's speed-talking all i can do is think about what a shitty life this kid must have to be sucked into a seedy door-to-door magazine subscription gig. he has all these crazy half-hand-written cards detailing a hilariously complex and clearly bogus point system, a dozen different pamphlets listing magazines and their costs, as well as stickers with strange rhyming phrases on them that he says are for ""nice people"" who help him get points.

i tell him i don't want any magazines, and he says that's ok because he has a list of people who he visited already who wanted magazines but couldn't afford them who were just waiting for a ""nice person"" like me to donate one of their magazines to them.

he very strongly reminds me of my wife's brother, who is schizophrenic and truly one of the most friendliest and gullible people you could ever meet. i tell him yeah, i'll donate some money for one of those people or ""you know, if you need to buy any supplies for that big trip you're going to win"" *wink wink*...

sadly, he seems oblivious to the hint and proceeds to fill out a receipt for me, with my name, a fake phone number that i recite to him, and the address of this corporate apartment that i'll be leaving in a couple months anyway. he exuberantly thanks me ""for the points,"" slaps one of his hand-made stickers on my door (which i remove shortly after he leaves), and goes on his way.

i felt okay about it, like maybe i just helped a kid who's down on his luck a little bit... but then i did some ddging and found [this story that the new york times ran in 2007](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/us/21magcrew.html?fta=y&_r=0) which details what life on these ""mag crews"" is really like. it was only then that i fully grasped that the kid at my door was the real victim. he's going to go straight back to whatever bus dropped him off here and hand my $40 over to some seedy asshole who cares more about it than he does the kid who brought it to him. he'll never win the trips or prizes he may think he's working toward. he'll never succeed at anything as long as he's being controlled by the sick fuckers who are using him.

so yeah, today i fucked up by basically handing $40 over to some douche who's abusing kids for his own financial gain. but at least i'm not alone--i guess life itself is fucked up pretty bad too.

input: Text: my great grandfather had received the silver star for valor during wwi. i had known this and the fact he came over from poland to join the us military to kill germans always seemed like an honorable thing. he was also 16 when he arrived and said he was 18 just to join. after the war he became a coal miner apparently. i started doing some research online to find out more about him and found someone with his name, the correct age and the right area of the country. they were a gun dealer tied to selling thompson machine guns (not thompson himself) that were used int he st. valentines day massacre. knowing no one in my family had ever told me about this and the guy used a pseodo name leaving off the last part of my last name, i struck out for truth.

i started with my cousin whose mom is the last living child of my great gradnfather. i got no suck luck about being a gun dealer but it shocked me that i was told that my great grandmother died in 1935 by falling off a wagon and hemorrhaging to death. she was pregnant. this seemed perfectly normal for a farmer so i thought nothing of it. desperate to seek out more truth in the whole gun selling category to al capone, i called up my grandmother to see what she may know about it. i didn't think she would know much since she wasn't a child of my great grandfather but was married to my grandpa for over 50 years so she might know something. i asked her about it and she gave me the ""i don't know story."" i then proceeded to mention the my cousin mentioned that great grandma fell off the wagon and this is where i fucked up... i had my 5 year old son in the room and 10 year old niece. grandma is on skype on the tv and she says, ""oh falling off the wagon is what he told people. no he beat her to death and just said that. your grandfather was 10 when it happened.""

queue the awkward silence... alright moving on. the answer i got was that it is possible he was the gun dealer because he would have been the right age, the right name, and the right nationality at the time. the events of the gun dealings happened in 1929 and my grandfather was born in 1925. anyways yeah so that it.

input: Text: hell yeah this happened today and i'm still pretty upset about it.

i'm 23 years old and still learning about kitchen shit, like what to use when cooking what, ect.. i feel like i make things more complicated than they should be. 


anyways, we had christmas food day here at work and i told everyone i was making the buffalo chicken dip that most guys like to make since it's so easy to prepare. as i was shopping for the ingredients i decided i was going to buy a deeper pan this time and double all of the ingredients so that there would be more for everyone to eat. [this](http://www.walmart.com/ip/farberware-nonstick-bakeware-9-inch-round-springform-pan-gray/10927197) is the pan i bought because it was the perfect size and it read ""oven ready"" in big letters on the front. it didn't say ""warning: the mufuckin bottom of this pan will come off at any damn time it feels like it""  because you know.. that would have been helpful in my pan-picking process.


i'll wrap it up now as you can see where this is going, i cooked it at work and as i was carrying it across the call center floor the bottom came off and down went the frank's hot buffalo chicken dip.. which again, was a lot by the way, quite a bit of it got on my legs and it was extremely hot. this dip is what i'm known for in the office because its so good so a lot of people were disappointed. i had to retell this story a couple dozen times, trust me, i learned.


one day i will find out why this pan exists but not today, i don't want to look at that monstrous contraption for another second.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: around two months ago, my friend was mad at me because i had stopped talking to her (texting her, offering to hang out, etc.), and when she asked why, my reasoning was that i thought i was being clingy and annoying as a friend.

anyway, there have been times before where she's been angry at me, so my go-to apology method is to drop her off an iced coffee from dunkin' on my way home from school, as this past year was my senior year of high school and she spent most of her time home, as she had just returned from her first year of college.

now i say this iced coffee method is my go-to, because twice before i had done this when she had gotten angry at me, and i went to her house with the iced coffee she normally gets and she normally forgives me and we spend a few hours talking about how stupid i was, or something along those lines.

back to the fuck up, that day, my incredible intuition told me that i could fix this pretty easily by getting her another coffee an apologizing, since it had worked so well before.

so i buy her drink and head over already planning in my head how i'm going to phrase my apology. i get to her house, walk to the door, and ring the doorbell. after sitting there for a minute or so, i ring it again. no answer again, so i walk around to her garage, which i noticed was open. immediately my thought process is that she is really mad this time and she won't answer the door. i thought to myself whether it would be smarter to just leave the drink at the door with a note, or to go inside and give a verbal apology. ~~obviously i went to the door, dropped the drink off, and went on with my day.~~

i walk into her house and all her lights were off. i called her name out and got no answer, so at that point i concluded nobody was home. i wasn't entirely sure what to do at this point, so i figured i'd just leave the drink in her fridge and text her later letting her that i thought she was home and didn't want the drink to go to waste. before i could even take a step, her alarm went off.

it took my brain a few seconds to actually comprehend what was going on, and i went into full panic mode. i ran upstairs, put the drink in her fridge and took my phone out to try to call her to let her know i set her alarm off. phone went straight to voicemail four times before i realized she wasn't going to pick up. i had absolutely no idea what to do, and at this point i was fumbling around like an idiot trying to figure out how to handle the situation, so being the logical person i was, i just tried to leave.

i get in my car, throw my seatbelt on and reverse down her driveway away from the wailing house. as i'm about to back out onto the road, i see someone in my rear view standing right at the end of her driveway so i stop. after a few seconds, i park the car and get out. still completely in shock from setting the alarm off, i stare at the woman standing behind my car for a few seconds before she asks me what i'm doing. i immediately told her i was going home, and she told me that i wasn't going anywhere. at that point i had conceded to the fact that this was something i was pretty much fucked on, so i got back in my car, turned it off and just sat there.

after what felt like the longest (and loudest thanks to the alarm) 15 minutes of my life, my friend came back home. she went inside, disarmed the security system, and spoke to the lady who was standing at the end of the driveway, who i later found out was her neighbor that was preventing me from leaving because she thought i tried to rob the house. after a few minutes of animated hand motions and various gestures towards my car, my friend came to talk to me. before i could even say a word, she said ""/u/tit04567, just go the fuck home.""

i went home and sat in bed for half an hour as my mind slowly started to understand what i actually had done. an hour or two later i got a call from my friend's cellphone. i picked up and it turned out her mom was calling from my friend's phone. to put it simply, she really let me have it. the gist of the conversation we had (which was effectively her just screaming at me and my responding with ""yes ma'am"") was that i wasn't welcome back to their home, i completed invaded their family's sense of privacy and that i hope i was happy with what i had done.

i came clean to my parents about the whole situation just so they could hear it from me and not anyone else. they reamed me out too, and told me they were disappointed, scared for me since i'm leaving for college soon and that its just a place full of opportunities for stupid decisions, and that they were pissed because now they had to go and apologize to my friend's family for my actions.

so yeah, it's been two months and i haven't heard from my friend, and she never responded to my apology text, so i think it's safe to say that i won't be able to fix this one with an iced coffee and an apology.

input: Text: **some background:** i'm an extremely quiet, introverted, socially awkward 20-something girl who recently found her voice somehow. shit like this used to be extremely difficult for me, and apparently something just snapped. 

so my great aunt roped us into going to some talent show at her old folks community. it was right after work, and i was exhausted. to be honest, i didn't feel like going, but i did it for my family's sake. the talent show was really, really, really boring and i was starting to feel overwhelmed from my anxiety, so i took my phone out for a few minutes to check my facebook. 

some old biddy turned around and told me to put it away in a rude tone (you know, the one that old people use when they want to be condescending because they're old and think they rule the world?). so anyway, something totally just snapped. i don't know if it was because i was tired or i was anxious or i just had enough, but i turned around and told her to mind her own business.

my grandma apparently heard this and decided to yell at the old lady right away, in the middle of the fucking talent show, causing a scene, to the point no where could hear anything going on in the stage. at that point, i just got up and left, but apparently after i left the mc of the show said something about the argument. my aunt was mad at all of us demanding an apology, but no one apologized in the end, because it was truly not her business. the scene part did not need to happen, though and it caused more undue anxiety than necessary.

input: Text: obligatory this happened around two weeks ago, not today.

me and my buddy usually go on the roof to be stupid, but this time i went to the top for a football. my roof slants, like most, and the football was positioned right between two slopes. i climbed on this shaky ass ladder that was almost as shaky as me going onto the roof. i'm used to going on the roof, so i wasn't scared about that. i was scared about slipping, since it rained all day, and only at this moment it was clearing up. there was still water caught in the shingles, so i can't say i was thrilled to be going up there. 

i finally get up there after i don't know how long, and now it's me versus that football. i charge towards it, just eager to get it done, but before i can grab it, i begin slipping backwards. the whole time my knees are scraping off of the roof, and i prepare myself for the inevitable. at this point i'm wishing that good god can save me from this, but i know there is no saving me now. my buddy is drinking a capri-sun or some shit like that as he watches in awe. my face scrapes off of the corner of the roof as i start to plummet off. this was not a soft landing either, considering i fell about twenty feet. i try to position myself so i don't land on my head, but instead i flop on my side. instantly my hip begins burning and the impact propelled my head with such force that i rammed my two front teeth into my arm. no, they weren't stuck, but there was a pretty bad wound afterwards.

as for my buddy, save me next time.

input: Text: actually (as usual) this didn’t happen today but about a year ago when csgo gambling was still a big of a thing... so let’s go.

i was casually gambling on a common csgo gambling site. i deposited some skins and they just wouldn’t show up in my inventory on that site... so i typed in the chat that there’s a problem with my deposit. a few minutes later a „moderator“ of that gambling site texted me that he would look into my issue... while looking into the issue the system of said site offered me a refund... so far so good usually a normal person would just accept the refund offer and go home... well that’s where the tifu part actually starts.

the mod asked me to add him on skype so we could talk, i called him we talked (as much as i could express myself with my limited capabilities in english as i’m not a native english speaker), i told him that i already received my items back and that everything is fine now... then he told me that he had to exchange the items because they were compromised and gliched out (those were around $50-60 in value). for a moment i thought that this is quite weird and doesn’t sound legit at all but hey as the stupid a** that i am i thought ok let’s do it... we did the trade and after a few minutes he meant that there aren’t any items like mine in the inventory of the bots and that the only way i could recover my value of skins was to give him some of my other skins and he would change the odds of the homepage in a way that i would win a really valuable knife in the next game with a 100% certainty... sounds ridiculous right? 

right! 

but as naive as i was i agreed and went on with the trade...  he seemed to actually do something as we had a longer talk. the talk actually was quite nice... ok he made fun of my broken english.. anyways he seemed quite trustworthy... somehow... 
sometimes and the uncertainty in my voice (i was f*cking scared and pretty much knew that i would never see my stuff again) but hey my only option was to wait and see what happens... well any rational mind knows what happened and so it did... after about half an hour of talking one of his buddies joined the conversation and they both yelled: „scammed!!“ and they hung of... 

as i said this happened a year ago and i now have some new skins i really but still this shouldn’t have happened...

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i must say, this happened a little less than a month ago. after a semester at mtsu, i came back home for xmas break. everything seemed fine but then the tension built up. i have always had a problem with my parents when it came to my dearest love, mary jane. they hated her. a few days after xmas i quit smoking and bought a couple of detox drinks, banking on the fact that i would pass their cheap cvs drug test. so i pissed in the cup that morning and all the drugs came back negative... except the thc label stayed positive. i was in awe, and immediately realized i was fucked. my mother looked at me and said, ""you know what happens next."" i asked when they wanted me gone, and their response was, ""whenever you're ready."" 
i knew i could have probably stayed a couple of days to figure out a plan, but i needed to get out. i and my mother always fought about more than just pot. she has a yelling problem, and is very strict when it comes to certain subjects. over the years, the yelling really got to me and i hated it. i could rant for hours as to all the reasons i chose to leave that day. but anyway, i packed all my stuff and my mother made sure that i understood that i was the one kicking myself out of the house. okay mom... okay.
i went to work at papa johns that day then spent the night at a friends house. my girlfriend, who i love with all my heart, dumped me that day too, saying that it was best so that i could get my life in order. everything was just getting worse. and it even got worse after that.
the next morning i woke up to find that my backpack with all my electronics was gone. ps4, macbook pro, ipad air, ps4 controllers, games, chargers, and my orange hairbrush was all in a backpack. that backpack was no where in my friends house. my friends game console and all of his items were still there, and claimed they had no idea where it went. i know they stole it. and of course, they kicked me out too after realizing i noticed it was gone. 
i got in my car, and left, having no idea what to do. i cried... i had lost what seemed like everything. the first stop i made before i went into work that day, was the usmc recruiting office.
i have my own apartment now with a roommate, and i'm doing better. i've made amends with my family, telling them i'm enlisting in the marines. after i failed the drug test, they weren't going to send me back to school. and honestly, it was the best decision. at school i was more worried about when i would have intimacy with mary jane rather than having intimacy with my school work. i need to so something with my life, and become the man god created me to be. i wanted to be a musician and be a performer on stage, but that has to be delayed now. the usmc recruiters told me to take a month and don't touch anymore fucking marijuana. the last time i smoked was december 31st. i know i can do this. it's the most determined i've ever been. 

so my message is, even when all hope feels lost, never give up. there is a plan for all of us. we just have to take one day at a time.

last night arriving home after some drinks, it occurred to me that the fify might not be a bad idea and that i should try it. so i made one and started getting *cozzy* with it. the fify being made out of a rubber glove it clearly needed some lubrification, so i applied some saliva. but since i was a bit drunk and was not getting off that easily, the fify kept getting dry. a quick look around and i have spotted a tanning oil that was lying around, so i poured some into the fify and continued. in about 20 seconds i started felling a bit warm down there, which at first was nice, but in about another 20 seconds my member was on fire. i made a run for the bathroom washing down the oil as quickly as i could. after the pain was gone and my member cooled down, i started washing the fify since i was not going to give up so easily, but it almost immediately bursted.  
5 minutes later i had an other fify. i am a determined man. this time i used real lubricant and after a few minutes the deed was done filling up fify. i wanted to lay fify carefully on the table while i get cleaned, but the moment it touched the table if exploded spattering cum and lubricant all over me, the table and the wall. at which point considering all the trouble i have gone through i just burst into laughter.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this actually happened today...  

i recently discovered that pure caffiene powder on the internet and thought that it sounded extremely useful.  i figured that it would be a good way to stop drinking coffee (which gives me heartburn) and provide some extra energy when needed.  it showed up in the mail last night and i used it for the first time this morning, the morning of the day that my girlfriend and i were scheduled to learn whether we are having a girl or boy.

a little back story before i get to the good stuff...  i have something called barrett's esophagus.  you can google it for details, but the tldr is that i've had bad enough acid reflux for long enough that i now have precancerous cells in my esophagus.  i also got a promotion recently and it came with a huge increase in responsibilty putting me in charge of several people and overseeing a lot of projects.  add to this the facts that i was a single father until i met my girlfriend, so i already have a 9 year old daughter, and my girlfriend is pregnant (and all the things that come with being pregnant) and i try to do my best to be in a good mood and not tired for her regardless of work.  you can probably see why pure caffeine seemed like a great idea...  

this morning when i got up, i went to the kitchen and opened up my new caffeine.  the label says that one scoop is 50mg and that i can have two a day...  i figure a teaspoon will do the trick and mix it with water, adding water and chugging until all the powder is gone.  after about 15 minutes i start to feel a bit anxious, but figure that this is normal and try to ignore it and go about my normal morning routine.  i get my daughter up, get her some cereal while she is getting dressed, and hop in the shower while she finishes getting ready for school.  by now i'm feeling kind of awful...  a bit dizzy, very anxious, and increasingly nauseated.  i start throwing up shortly after and realize that i might have made a mistake.

i send my daughter to the bus stop with her friends and their parents, sit on the couch, and try to stay calm.  my girlfriend gets up at this point and asks if i'm ok.  i tell her what i've done and she calls me an idiot.  i decide that maybe i can run it off.  i call a guy at work and let him know that i'll be late then change into workout clothes, head outside, and start running.

i come back home after a short run and after pacing for a bit, decide that i'm dying.  i tell my girlfriend to call 911 and stand outside to wait while puking my brains out.  the ambulance shows up and rushes me to the hospital where i get several bags of fluid, some zofran, and other stuff (don't remember a lot).

so...  what did i do wrong?  turns out that the bag comes with a scoop.  it's tiny, like really tiny.  instead of the 50mg i would get from the scoop, my teaspoon was more like 5000mg...  possibly more if there was bad caking.  definitely more caffeine than is healthy.

we still made it to our appointment.  my girlfriend decided that since i was taken care of medically, my misery was all on me and not really important.  i sucked it up and did my best to not ruin the appointment.  she is still mad at me, but hopefully i can live it down soon.  i think i'm already being punished enough because i still can barely keep anything down.

and to preempt the question, no, i'm not revealing the gender on here.  there is no telling who will see this and work it out and i'm in enough trouble already without ruining the surprise.

 


edit: to address everyone who is wondering about my angry girlfriend.  i agree that it is upsetting, but i need to drop a bit more history for you to understand.  the chance of her having a child was very, very low.  she has a whole host of reproductive problems and had already resignes herself to never having her own children...  this is a miracle for her and the only time she gets to experience it.  by putting myself in the hospital, because mistake or not, i did it, i messed with one of the most important days of the pregnancy.  she was concerned while i was in danger, but once the danger was judged as passed, she was angry.

input: Text: lemme start by saying i'm a farm manager in australia, and at the end of the picking season we host a massive party for all the pickers and packers on the farm grounds, it's friday night (saturday morning) currently for us australians. this year was particularly large with a turnout of well over 300. so i'm there with the other managers and people are just throwing the drinks at us, it's barely 9:00 and i'm 5 beers down, 9:45 and i'm 8 down. to give you all a bit of perspective, i'm 18 years old and (apparently) the world's biggest lightweight. bam; alco sickness starts to hit. 'i got this' i think 'i can hold my alcohol' i think. by the beard of zeus i was so wrong. 

i sneak away and try to have a sneaky vom, far away from where anyone would know i chucked up, feeling that i had to keep my reputation in tact, i didn't want to be the guy that had the story that makes people think 'goddamn. that's fucked'. sit there for ten mins waiting to open the floodgates. nothing comes up. so i shrug my shoulders and head back. 

i get back to see my mate's pulled a girl over (never seen her before) and is winging me the shit in. he hands me a bit of weed, talks about my dick for a bit, she's completely for it, i'm completely for it and at some point it becomes apparent that we're gonna fuck. so she's already dirty talking as we're getting into the manager's office and i'm giggling like a fucking twelve year old that's looking up vaginas for the first time in google images and she's taking off my pants and i'm taking off her shirt and i'm thinking to myself 'fuck yeah i'm so good at this fucking hell can't even tell that i'm a virgin' and then i feel the slightest bulge in my chest followed by bile in my mouth. i swallow it back. keep doing my work; kissing here rubbing there. i got this. i'm good. i'm on her chest and she's moaning, and then....vomit. so much vomit. dripping from her breasts. running from my chest. covering the office floor. it smells like the worst, most rotten cheese crossed with decaying carcass of small animal. kinda chunky too.


she said a soft 'oh' and tries to help clean


vomit another 8 times while she's trying to help clean


the office is covered in my cheesy chunky vomit.

input: Text: this happened after i got home from work today, and i got home like any normal day and sat down on my porcelain throne to take my evening dump. 

i've been battling a runny nose as the weather changes have been quite bipolar, and as a result i've gotten a cold. 

i finish pooping and i start to wipe up when all of a sudden i feel a tickle in my nose. normally i don't feel the urge to cover my nose, except i already felt the snot running down my upper lip and so instinctively covered my nose with.. you guessed. my shit covered toilet paper. tiny bits of shit are now in my nostril and are soon propelled out in a hellish mixture of snot and shit in one sneeze. i then proceed to throw up next to the toilet from the smell in my nose. it was quite a clean up.

input: Text: this is a fresh fuck-up, only about an hour or so ago. only now did i realize i fucked up.

my roommates and i were out doing some grocery shopping and we noticed on our way out of the store that there was some sort of altercation happening in the parking lot. from what i saw, there were about four guys and an equal number of girls, so i assumed it was a fight between a couple guys over one of the girls. i, for whatever reason, decided to have a bit of a laugh over what i assumed was a dude-brawl and shouted ""fuck 'em up!""

two of the four guys are sitting in a car urging the other two to get in and sped off when the other two took their advice. i didn't quite get why two guys i thought were fighting were getting into the same car, but i didn't think much of it, i'd had my giggle. my roommates and i got into our car and headed home, counting about six police cars heading towards the store.

one of my roommates (we'll call roommate 1) decides he wants some bacon after we get back home, so he heads back to the same grocery store to see what the situation was. my other roommate (we'll call roommate 2) and i were sitting at the dining room table enjoying a beer when roommate 1 comes back and informs roommate 2 and i about what happened.

apparently, a guy was beating the hell out of his girlfriend over a cellphone. and i probably made the situation a whole lot worse.

here's where i fucked up. after checking all my mistakes, i handed my paper to my actual teacher's account. little did i know, turnitin checks all their own databases for plagiarism, so when i handed my paper in, i got a 100% similarity to the paper that i sent in to my fake teacher's account. to dumb it down, the system basically thinks i copied work from another student, but in reality that student is me.

input: Text: this happened not even an hour ago. also not from the us so apologies if any of the phrasing is different or anything. and this is my first reddit post so feel free to correct any of my mistakes.

so a little backstory, i am in my final year of secondary school (high school i guess) so i need to book a place to stay for college as the place i want to study at is pretty far away. campus accommodation booking opened today so i took the day off of school in order to have a chance to book in. not sure if it is similar in other areas but when people try to book into the accommodation through the website, it is prone to crash pretty much instantly. 
so after about an hour of refreshing over and over again, i am finally able to register on the website. perfect, right? well, i decided to go absolutely full stupid and got a little excited. so without reading the instructions to the e-mail, i rush back onto the site with the password i need to sign. i proceed to enter my username and the password. it doesn't work, but i just think of it as a mistake because of all the traffic being directed towards the site.

so,being impatient, i continue to put in the same details for the next hour until i realize the place is booked up completely. at this point, i decide to check my e-mail in case they sent me something. i then realize i shouldn't have been entering my e-mail to log in but a separate username that i had missed.

so now because of my own stupidity, i will have to spend a small fortune worth of gas money to get up and down to college..... the mother is not happy.

okay now that the disclaimer is out of the way onto the accident. i'm a drinker, i'll be the first to admit it. i don't do drugs i just like to drink some beers. i'm a jovial drunk. that being said, i sometimes act out in my sleep and it's worse when i drink it's progressively been happening more and more frequently, 2-3 times a year. these can be anything from sleep walking, conversations with my girlfriend or just the occasional vivid dreaming. this time it was just the vivid dreaming, although there was a time when i was sleep walking  i peed on my best friends kitchen table. that's seriously the most embarrassing thing ever. we chalked it up to if i was at home that's where the bathroom would've been. i hadn't been drinking that time. 
this time though, i had been drinking a lot. at this point i was laying down on my stomach with my right arm on my side. my girlfriend was basically snuggled up next to my arm. i was having a really, really vivid dream. i had just gotten out of the shower and i was drying off when i heard two voices outside the door. one was my brother but the other voice i'd never heard before. it was very sly and made me unbelievably nervous. he was asking my brother how to get in. then he said, ""i need to sick him."" i immediately went into action getting ready for him to come in. standing there naked with nothing but a towel... the door slowly opened up and a slim bald man with his eyes sewn shut was standing there. in his hand was a large syringe. i froze for a split second, i couldn't register this thing. senses kicked in and thinking he couldn't see me i rushed him. tried to wrap my towel around the syringe but he was to fast and he grabbed my arm. right then i saw the needle, as he went to plunge it in i jerked back my arm. right at that moment i had woken up and simultaneously jerked my elbow into my girlfriend's throat. next thing i hear is gasp for air. i freak the f*ck out wondering what the hell i just did. i couldn't stop apologizing enough. after she caught her breath and i told her what had happened she laughed. but i felt so horrible the rest of the day. she still jokes but i can't imagine being woken up at 4 in the morning to an elbow to the throat.

so ten days ago i got back in touch with this guy i knew in hs and messed around with a little while after. he wanted a relationship and i figured we'd give it a try because i did like him and he's a pretty cool guy. cue fuck up.

everything was sexual. everything was clingy. everything was possessive. everything was eh.

anytime i mentioned going anywhere i'd get a ""who's going to be there"". if i didn't answer my phone right away i'd get at least three messages after the other wondering where i was. every convo held took a turn for sex and sex-related topics and how ""sexy"" i am.

seven days into ""dating"" (more like texting back and forth and supposedly being his babe because we hadn't actually *seen* each other in two years since our tomfoolery) and we're discussing kinks and i express discomfort with one but he keeps insisting. red flag #1 but i'm patient and brush it off, i've dealt with pushy guys before, not afraid to sock him in the mouth or gnads if the pushy happens if we were to meet up. 

eight days into ""dating"" he asked about getting a place with me and moving in together. red flag #2, i'm starting to distance myself and try to figure out how to address these rising flags. 

nine days into ""dating"" and he hints to wanting another kid (has one that's not mine). red flag #3 and i have no idea what to do any more.

now we're on day ten and i'm not answering my phone because i'm literally just beside myself on what the fuck to do because he's nice enough but i really don't see this working out, especially not with all these red flags waving.

i clicked the first video that popped up, and skimmed through the video, trying to find where we need help, only to be witnessing multiple endings to the full game, click by click.

i didn't realised at first what i've done. the cutscenes looked a lot different from the demo, and as that thought popped in my head, that's when i realized my mistake.

input: Text: so, this didn't happen today, more like 6 months ago. the funny thing is i didn't fuck up at first, but my panicking just escalated the whole situation. you see, the latin word for song is carmen. we were having a bit of a rehearsal, so the teacher would go around randomly spouting latin words, and we'd have to give the translations. this is where shit gets fucked. 

the latin teacher asks for the translation of carmen, and i say song. then, this thought pops up my head. wasn't there somebody named carmen elektra? i ask this to my latin teacher as well, who is a cool dude. you see, i know carmen elektra from meet the spartans, which i saw at a friend's birthday party. the name was pretty eccentric which made it stick in my head. this leads us back to my latin class. 

my latin teacher makes the remark to me that carman elektra is a pornstar. immediately, i start questioning myself. i go into damage control, as more people around me start blsuhing and lauging. then is say: ""well, she's just a regular actress as well isn't she?"". this comes off as a very cheap escape plan. thing is, i actually meant it. immediately after this, weh ahve a break. this is where i really should have handled the situation more carefully. 

i keep coming to people showing them meet the spartans on imdb, and telling them about the birthday party. each one shrugs it off. this causes me to panic, and i drink a dr. pepper to lighten the stress. as soon as i've finished it however, i see two classmates, both girls, standing in the hall in front of me. and me, being the anxious dumbass that i am, goed to them and starts telling them frantically about meet the spartans. they were having a conversation while i did this, so i came off asincredibly rude.  
 
after this huge fiasco, i just backed of and remained silent for the day. thw ironic thing is, is that most people who have a tifu in relation to porn actaully fid watch it, and had a freudian slip or the like. i was actually innocent in this whole thing, which makes it kind of sad. all because of one really shitty 300 ripoff.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: my girlfriend and i have been dating for a year as of dec. 15. she has a child that turned 1 in oct.   

since we've been dating, i've grown extremely close to her child. he calls me dad, and i wouldn't have it any other way. he is now the reason for each breath i take.  

ok, so enough background.  

a few days ago, she asks me if i would be able to (or even want to) watch him while she was at work. of course i said yes. however, i've never watched a child all alone before. this literally scared the shit out of me, but of course i didn't tell her this. it was my chance to prove to her, and myself, that i could handle this!   

fast forward a few hours, now she's on her way to my house. i've literally baby-proofed everything in my house(or so i thought). by this point, i've already started-chain smoking, because i'm so nervous. (terrible, i know.)   

ok, they're here! this is it! now or never! so, she leaves him with me. it's just me and him. we're doing great so far! 

fast forward a couple hours: time to change my first diaper! *complete* hey, that wasn't too bad at all!   

the day is coming to an end. it's time to put him to sleep now. we've almost made it!   

**here's where it gets interesting.**  
so, i manage to get him to fall asleep pretty easily. i get his little pack-n-play (portable crib thingy) setup. i proceed to put him in there, without him waking up! yay!   

now, in my house, i don't have central heat/air. i use space heaters to keep warm. (not a big house, and i don't get cold easy.) so, i figure it's a little chilly for him in here. i decided to turn on the space heater, and kind of move it closer towards him so he would be comfy. everything's perfect! our first time was successful!   

*until it happened.*  

i go outside to take a smoke break. leaving the child inside. no big deal, right? right!   

so, i'm outside smoking. he's fast asleep. then, all of a sudden i hear screaming, crying. i take off running inside...   

oh my god! fire!!   

he had woken up while i was outside, managed to knock a lamp over. the lamp then hit the space heater. the space heater landed on some clothes, and stared a fucking fire!!   

i got the fire put out pretty easily, and grab the child, and make sure he's ok. he's fine!  

most of my clothes, and the carpet are ruined. the lamp is broken, i almost died of a heart attack, and could have killed my girlfriend's child. other than that, everything is a ok.

input: Text: i had just come back with my father from the gas station where i was picking up some pop. i went upstairs only to find my mother requesting i go back outside and into my father's car to bring inside those 24 packs of bottled waters. i only took a sweatshirt and went outside to my father's car, a 2008 toyota pilot. upon first inspection, the back of the car couldn't be open with a key. so, i unlocked the front main passenger door in hopes of finding the trunk lever that should've been in the driver seat area. i eventually unlock the door and inspect the floor, but with no luck. pitch black, -11-degree weather, i decided my last resort was to climb in and inspect that way. and so, i did. i climbed in and toggled the lights ahead of me, later would i realize those are the only functional lights in the car. before i could start searching for the lever, something kicked in and it only felt natural to lock the door. and, so i did. shortly after turning on the lights i inspected from the inside. no luck, the lever was still hidden by some darkness. shortly thereafter, i had given up. and so i was ready to make my leave out of the cold car.   however, the buttons i had started clicking were not responding. it took about a minute of clicking to realize what i had done. it didn't take another second after that for a panic attack to kick in, follow by claustrophobia. out of panic, i punched the window. all for naught. the punch damaged my hand and my ego. i would later check all the doors. none of them opened from the inside. the back of the trunk also did not open. at that point, the realization of being stuck in a car, i started feeling the pain in my hand and the cold. at one point i thought i really was going to die.  so, i had just given up, cold, stuck in the car. i decided i would just wait until someone would come check on me, because surely someone would, right? no one did. and so, in a desperate, and calmer, last minute attempt i climbed back into the passenger seat. looked back on the panel, and clicked the buttons. it wasn't until i tried clicking the buttons back and forth (don't ask...) i realized i unlocked the door. i ran out of the car without the keys, and doors unlocked. i suppose the biggest tifu was telling my parents this. they just laughed.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: my dorm-mates are pleading with me to share this story with you reddit, so i must oblige. this happened a few days ago, on friday night.

so i recently just ended a 5+ year relationship. i found out my ex had cheated on me with one of our co-workers (we worked at the same pizza shop - good money for a struggling college student such as myself). it was a difficult break-up, we argued, gave each other our stuff, etc. 

that was about three weeks ago. friday rolls around and my dorm-mate and i get invited over to our other friend's dorm for a little soirée to take place at around 8 or 9. i've never been a big drinker, but i was still upset about the break up and...*well*, i am sure you see where this is going.

i have a few cans of pbr before heading over to their dorm. i bring 7 or so and figure i won't be needing any more than that. people start coming in and beer pong picks up; music is playing and i begin to lose track of how much i am drinking and how fast i am drinking it. 

i finish the beer i brought with me and ask one of my friends if they have any i can buy off them. he offers me two pbr tall-boys, for free! man, i have great friends. 

i finish those.

another friend offers me his beer, great! i accidentally spill some on myself and the floor. oops! now i have to drink from the punishment bottle! (bottle filled with shit whiskey that my friend and his room-mates force fuck ups to drink from). i am told i more or less had a few gulps of it. its now maybe 11 or so. i get to talking to a bunch of people, telling them the recent tragic events that occurred between my ex and i, them telling me i am a great guy and i could do better, you know the deal. i'm impressionable at this point. 

yeah! fuck that shit! i *am* a nice guy darndangit! i always treated her right! whatever, i'm over that stuff! on to big and better things! 

i wake up the next morning. i am still kind of drunk and very dehydrated. i look at my phone and see that it's 830. fuck. i have work at 11. wait a minute...

i had about **30 unread text messages**, as well as snapchats and twitter dm's and everything. *damn*, i think to myself, *i was pretty drunk last night*.

i noticed that i had texts from my ex. *great*, i think. i reluctantly open it up and the most recent text reads something like this:

""i know you're mad at me, and i fucked up, but that was kinda uncalled for.""

what?

i scroll up. there's a bunch of pictures i sent her after getting back, with captions like ""here, have these back"" and ""i dont want these anymore"" and ""give these over to your new boyfriend"". 

**they were nudes...of herself.** that she had sent to me when we were still dating. 

you see, when drunk, i had felt so much indignation that i sought to remove the dirty pics i had of my ex from my phone; however, i was too drunk to understand that sending them back to her **was not the same as not having them anymore/deleting them**. 

needless to say she wasn't very happy with me. we aren't really speaking at the moment, and although i tried to explain myself that day about what was going through my mind, it didn't really make things any better. now i am the asshole who was just trying to prove a point. hey, maybe she's right. i don't really remember.  

as a nice little side note, i had dm'd a really nice girl that same night, whom i had worked with a while ago, the most charming and most coy line in the existence of dm's: 

""what's your snapchat haha"".

like, what the fuck was i thinking?

she asked me for *my* number the next day.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: i must say that his was a couple of years back, maybe sophomore year.  i was running for vice president of our class (i run for a position every year even though i never win, i just don't want to regret it later).

anyways, it was time for me to get up and do my speech.  now, i've never been the best at speeches.  in my eighth grade speech, i decide not to wear glasses or contacts to try and ease the anxiety since i wouldn't be seeing the the people (horrible idea) and i ended up insulting some girl who was running because i made a joke about her position and was apparently staring straight at her- the crowd went 'oooh' and she apparently teared up a bit.

what makes be bad at it, you ask?  my writing isn't too bad but it's better aimed at thirty-year-old men or as a ted talk than for high school children.  i'm not very good at actually speaking in public either- my body temperature drops and i start to shiver, stutter a bit, and my mind goes completely blank.  i also go into what a friend of mine once called 'hitler mode'.  i become very authoritarian and cold.

in this speech, i didn't have a piece of paper with me, so no guide unless my memory served me well.  in fact, there was no podium this time either, it was just you on stage in the auditorium.  i walk up and the activities director passed me the microphone.

'hey, i'm gabe', i started and then started talking about some basic leadership stuff, although i try to avoid being like almost everybody else's speeches which begin with 'merriam-webster defines leadership as…'.

at this point my mind starts going blank, i start to shiver a bit although it was probably contained, and then i stopped speaking for a second, booting up hitler mode, and i said the dumbest possible thing: ’y'know, i just really don't like people.'

half of the crowd just frowned (one of my friends told me that his little area liked me and then went into a minor depression at the severe tone and dark look on my face), thinking of why i wouldn't like them, what they'd done to deserve my hatred.  my friends start laughing their asses off, and the activity director is probably just shaking his head.

needless to say, i lost again.  but hey, at least i tried. :/

so i'm currently snowed in, and was talking to a fellow redditor last night in the same situation. we decided to play an online version of cards against humanity. this happens to be one of my favorite party games, so i was absolutely down. 

we'd been discussing our hands, without actually telling each other what we had, so as not to cheat. she mentioned that there were some cards that she didn't like and refused to play. now, i'm pretty much the sort of guy that likes to be as offensive as possible while still making sense while playing cah. that's just my thing. i asked her what sort of cards she refused to play, and her response was essentially ""the rape ones."" 

now, we were texting on kik while playing this game, and i clearly wasn't paying enough attention to my phone. i attempted to say, ""well, rape is wrong."" clearly, my phone had other intentions, as what came out was ""rape is write."" whoops. she was cool about it though.

i'd post the screenshots, but i just scrolled up, and the chat has scrolled long past that point :(

input: Text: *this happened about a year ago.*

my gf's grandpa passed and i planed on staying at her parent's place for a while to console her (i.e sexy time). at the same time this whole thing is going on, i had gotten a new laptop; and with all new things that have camera capability, i take some obligatory cock shots. i finish up, close the lid and get into the day-to-day not giving it a second thought. 

later in the day, i head to her parent's place, laptop/all other belongings in hand. she's at work, so i put all my stuff in her room upstairs... except my laptop. i throw that on the table and head to the kitchen to raid the fridge--family's of the deceased always have a shit-ton of delicious food. while i'm making some mac'n'cheese, she and her brother come home. 

she's terribly et up about the death of her grandfather--as well she should be. trying to change the subject, i mention my laptop.

""babe, check out my new toy!"" 

i boot it up and wait as she wipes tears from her eyes with the back of her sleeve. at this time, her 13-year-old brother comes down the stairs and (as a techy) is extremely enthralled with my laptop. windows 8 pops up, and i put in my password... that's where i fucked up. returning all three of our gazes is a picture of butt naked me, lying on my back nursing a huge boner and playing with my balls. neither of them is ok with it still to this day.

so, i'm having a dandy ol' time until i feel itchy. i look down and there's a bajillion ants around me. so, i'm allergic to ants. it's not super bad, but bites swell up to the size of a quarter and and get super hard and itchy. i realize that an ant crawled up my shorts bit me right near my butt cheek. it hurt like crazy. to make it worse, i had to ride my bike home with a bite on my ass. i get home and i find out that it is very swollen with a diameter of about two inches. it also spread to the area right around my coochie lip. weird to explain to my fam fam why i was scratching my crotch.

given the fact that we had just had a huge fight, i guess she was trying to find reasons to not get back together with me and stumbled upon that. now i never gave her my username but its the same name i use on most video game so i imagine it wasn't hard to put 2 and 2 together.

input: Text: so to begin: i'm in college but during the weekends i live with my parents.  my bedroom is next to the living room.  yesterday i had a night of heavy drinking with my friends.

today i woke up with a hangover, declined breakfast, shambled to my pc and began playing ""icewind dale: ee"" after a while i feel my stomach beginning to act up.  
i really was not in the mood for doing a number 2 so i made a compromise with myself: first i finish my party creation, then i'll answer the call of nature.

i'm almost done with party creation but the struggle in my stomach is rapidly escalating.  i took a big drink of water and things got real.

i experienced the human glitch that causes you to sometimes breathe the water in instead of drinking it.  so there i was, at my desk, mouth full of water and water on the way to my lungs.  
i did not want to get my desk or my floor wet so i began the desperate race against time and try to drink all the water in my mouth before i ran out of air.

halfway through the water in my mouth i just couldn't hold it anymore, i stood up and started to vomit water all over the floor (pretty loudly).  
the tension of the vomiting however caused my bowels to empty themselves in my pants.  there i stood, hunched over, feces running down my legs and my mom comes in the room asking if everything is allright.  

a look of horror begins to appear on her face as she looked down.  i said ""it's hard to explain, i'll go take a shower and i'll clean this up."".  we did not talk about this incident again.

**bzzzzt** ... **bzzzzt** ... *ring ring*

as is often the case when i hear that *particular* ringtone for unknown numbers i pause to consider what i might possibly say to whomever i discover on the other end.  typically i will be greeted with utter silence or the tell-tale click of a robo-dialer dropping the call, but i always steel myself for the possibility of genuine human speech uttered in response to my...

• me: ""hello?""

• phone: ""***do you want to make money from home?!?!?!  more money than you have ever seen in your ___life___?!?!??!?!***""

dammit.  it's a recorded message, and it was loud.  those aren't nearly as fun because you don't get to cuss anyone.  for the most part i have learned that the only way to stop them from calling back is to wait until they finish their speech and get to the part where you can...

• phone: ""***press 1 for more information!!!!!***  (or press 9 to be removed from our list)""

• me: presses 9.

• phone: ""***thank you for signing up!***  someone will be calling you real soon!""

• me: ""you son of a bitch.""

• phone: ""*click*""

it takes a lot to piss me off.  it really does!  there's very few things that make me want to punch faces in this world and this sort of thing ranks right up there... ~~just above sloths.~~  this put me in mind of that ol' classic ""cat facts"" prank.  still, maybe they just got their wires crossed.  i highly doubt that my phone was going to...

**bzzzzt** ... **bzzzzt** ... *ring ring*

• me: ""hello?""

• phone: ""thanks for telling us you wanted more information about this great offer!!!  my name is mike and i want to ..."" blah blah blah... ""write down my number in case you have any questions!  that number is xxx-xxx-xxxx!!!""

• me: ""*click*""

okay....  so now i have this piece of shit's *actual* phone number.  time to teach him a lesson.

• me: ... dialing ... waiting ... ringing!!!

• phone: ""leave a message! ***beep!***""

• me: ""hey mike!  guess what you can do?  you can eat my *actual* asshole!  that's right!  it's covered with fresh chocolate frosting, too!!!  it might taste a little strange at first, but you'll get used to it...  ***your mom did!*** *click*""

haha.  yeah, i sure showed that guy, didn't i.  just a little harmless fun, after all.

right?

**bzzzzt** ... **bzzzzt** ... *ring ring*

• me: ""hello?""

• random dude : ""yeah, did i just miss a call from you?""

• me: check the number... not the one i just called... ""no, sorry.  wasn't me.""

• random dude : ""oh, okay then.  bye."" *click*

**bzzzzt** ... **bzzzzt** ... *ring ring*

• me: ""hello?""

• random chick : ""who is this?""

• me: ""excuse me?""

• random chick : ""who is this?  why you be callin my phone?  take me off yo list."" *click*

oh shit...  a little light bulb just popped on over my ...

**bzzzzt** ... **bzzzzt** ... *ring ring*

• me: ""hello?""

• random chick : ""did i just miss a call from you?""

***mother.  fucker.***

over the course of the next 4 hours my phone was bombarded with calls from irate people wanting to be taken off the list.  it was nuts.  hundreds of calls.  text messages.  my voicemail box was destroyed.

***that bastard changed the number caller id shows to give people my number instead.***  pissed off doesn't begin to describe how i felt.  fortunately that phone number was one i only used for close family, so it was a trivial matter to change it, but still.

so, yeah...  he got me good.

once downstairs, i sit in a corner with her, shaking. my husband comes down after us, convinces my it was just a dust devil and not a tornado, but we all decide to hunker down anyway watching the radar on his cellphone. it was tornado season and a storm was coming in, so very good chance a tornado could come. 
as the adrenaline starts to wear off, i realize my mistake. i can't move. my pelvis is in such pain that i can't even stand under my own weight. after about an hour in the basement, the storm has passed, and my husband had to basically carry my very large, pregnant self up the stairs. i spent the next 3 days until my induction in bed for the most part. my husband (6'5"", i'm 5'7"") had some old crutches that i used to get to the bathroom and back to bed, but i couldn't really go far on them since they were really tall and hurt my armpits. labor was a treat, since i couldn't walk the halls to get things going. at least i wasn't expected to move much for the next couple weeks as i recovered.

input: Text: *throwaway*

 also, long post, i am sorry...

this may look like a stupid tifu to a lot of people, maybe a majority, but i don’t give a fuck. clearly i do not give a fuck because i fucked up not only today, but every day since i laid eyes on the poor lad.

about four months ago i started working at this high end french restaurant. i got the job thanks to the help of an old friend/coworker; from here on out he will be known as the og friend. we go waaaaay back! i get hired and that is even more awesome right!? here begins my dilemma.
my first friday shift i meet lots of coworkers. i am usually an introvert person unless a situation forces me to have a social interaction. i tend to play weirdo in the corner ignoring everyone else because i am watching and observing. so, that day, i decide to do both and be quick about it. my manager, who at the time intimidated the shit out me, encourages me to speak to everyone i have not met yet. there was someone who caught my eye earlier that i observed more than anyone else because he is fucking attractive; like kit harington attractive. he makes his way to the hostess stand and i immediately extend my hand for his and he immediately grabs mine, we lock eyes, and i word vomit so quickly, and sternly, my name then follow with asking him his. he stutters. stammers. even cuter. he lets go of my hand finally and says at least 3 different names he goes by. i ask him if i should call him “j” and he gives me the nervous, word vomits back but with a harsh “no.” i look confused and automatically assume this is where it ends. he instantly apologizes and smiles, giving me the preferred name. 

the evening goes on and my og friend comes to say bye before he heads out to a coworkers grad party and invites me. my shift comes to an end and i decide to attend this party as a stranger. before leaving, kits’ doppelganger stops me to say he would see me next week but another manager cuts him off screaming, “naw she is going to the party, we gonna get fucked up!” clone of kit smiles ear to ear and says he will see me there. 
for a split second panic set in though because the moment, it was an extremely anxiety ridden social situation for me. after a shot and a margarita, i am feeling a little better. right when i am feeling a little more comfortable to talk to people (i don’t fucking know) king of the north comes walking into the scene. my og friend comes up to me and asks if i have buds. “do i have buds?!” og friend pulls kitty from the side and asks if i can smoke him out. we smoke one bowl and i feel like i am falling for this guy every damn second that passes but i am telling myself it is because i had a decent amount of tequila and now some delicious dank. turns out i am not the only one feeling the attracted vibes. the night goes on and we get closer to each other, smoke another bowl together, and eventually…go back to his place together. we have some of the best sex i had. our energies are on fire. we talked for a long time too, about why i am not on birth control, why i am back in the lone star state, in which turns into me specifying wanting to be casual; wound of shitty long term/somewhat long distance relationship was still fresh, trust issues intensified, and i was leaving to another state to finish getting my degree...forming a serious relationship is a bad idea. 

i go home and later that day he wants to see me again. he drives an hour to my place and he meets my family, has dinner with us, and attends a movie with my brothers and some high school friends, and…stays…the night. he is the first person i have sex with in my parents’ house…in my bed…while they are home! i am clearly falling for this fool because before, engaged, not engaged, serious relationship, or not, i risk having sex in my conservative parents’ home. the next evening i see my og friend and he tells me, “king snow does not want casual relations…he wants a legit girlfriend.” fuck. no. fucking. way! i am in shock. i did not think he was that serious about me. i already told him i wanted casual, why didn’t he tell me himself?! fast forward that night and he is back in my bed. i ask him why he didn’t tell me the first night. he responds with the whole, “i did not want you to think i was lame and stop talking to me.” oh boy. i try to explain again my reasons and now one of them developed within three days, i did not want to hurt him or leave the mainland being hurt because i fell in love with him. he says he understands. 

i believe it. (fucking up already)

i begin to really trust him…the surprising part is that, i began to trust again. just a year ago my heart was pretty determined to trust no one ever again.

for the next three weeks, we are inseparable, we went one day without seeing each other until he left to bonnaroo with my og friend. it was harder for me to admit how i felt because it was all happening so fast and felt right and yet i had been led down that path before, where it all looked so clear, when only it turned into a trap. i had been hurt too much that the feeling of loving someone or someone loving me was not possible. love like i thought did not exist no matter how much i offered my heart out. it always seems that the one i feel is just right…disappears. i had a little mushroom trip while he was gone and realized i was holding back on him and should tell him how i really feel...and i did. he did not believe me because what i feared would happen... is what happened two days later. 

even though he would ask or want to be in presence, his energy felt as if he did not even want to be there. 
he did a complete 180. 
nearly everyone at work knew, we were becoming something, whatever it was, i was going with the flow and along with the ride because i trusted him to take control. 

i was wrong. i do not want to be, but i was. 

since then, our encounters are awkward and i find myself fighting every urge inside of me to tell him how i really feel because i also believe he made himself clear when he said, “you are too much of a distraction for me right now.” i should pass it by. water off my back right? the show must go on? 

that was and is the hard part.

he will place himself right beside me, whisper his silly puns that literally never stopped to put a smile upon my face. whether they were corny and awful or clever as fuck, i enjoyed them all the same. he thought my laughs were fake. they were genuine and i guess that is where my friends are right about him being wrong for me. he didn’t believe me. he didn’t trust me…as much as i did in him. 

kind of heartbreaking, to feel for someone that much and finally feel so close to having what you always thought was good enough, and still battle with how you deserve better than “good enough.”

yet, there is something about him. i am not sure why there is such a hold, when it is all false hope. his eyes don’t tell me that, when i catch them, looking my direction, locking contact for a few seconds, only for one of us to distract ourselves. the way he looked and held himself when i showed up to a mutual friends’ apartment from a straight up date just four nights ago. 

judge me all you want for trying to go on dates and meet other people. if he was over me, isn’t that what i am supposed to do if i so please? because at this point i have come to terms with these strong feelings i have are pointless, useless, and what is done and in the past it is staying there. still, dreams of him come every night. *see you again* by tyler the creator are the words i would sing to him. hell a made an entire playlist and add to it when i hear a song that relates to the situation with him. 

to top off how i have fucked up any chance with him, i left what should be my final attempt with getting him back in his jacket that he is taking back. his last day at work is saturday and i thought about waiting until then but i couldn’t. i wrote him a song. he has inspired a lot of lyrics of late for me and the one i left him…the least i could ask is he keeps it and he knows someone loves him. best case scenario, i find him in my arms and i in his again. the worst, and most realistic, is he tells me to give it up and leave him alone, that i am wasting my time and my energy, and he throws the lyrics away, which in essence is my heart. 

i fucked up y’all. i fell for someone after telling myself for a good year to avoid the feels, and avoid attachments for the exact outcomes that occurred. 

i probably fucked up this tifu too. 

thank you to anyone who read this shitty word vomit.

input: Text: so i'm a picker.  scabs, dead skin, whatever.  i know that's gross, but in the comfort of my own home i should be able to do whatever i want, right?  

well i have this great wart on the bottom of my right foot.  it's pretty 'in there', existing almost under the thick skin under my foot, showing itself with a small, hardened circle that's just about flush with the rest of the skin. 

at about 0445 this morning, i woke up on the couch and absently started picking at my wart.  usually, the top hard part sort of scrapes off, but i don't get any of the juicy stuff underneath because it hurts too bad to dig out on its own.  this morning, however, was special.  as i picked, i realized that the top callus was pulling some of the 'meat' of the wart with it.  with glee and anticipation, i worked studiously at pulling as much of this wart out whole as i could, picking and maneuvering my fingers to find purchase.  finally, with a firm and very painful pull, i pulled the callus off and most of the wart meat with it.  the chunk of flesh was about half the size of a pencil eraser, a hard piece of dead skin attached to wart guts that looked like the stuff inside crab legs.

anyway, i only had a second to marvel at my work before the blood came... and came... and came...   i was in shock.  the blood started as a quick, thick drop, for about two full seconds but soon was spilling out over my toes and pants.  i can't remember when i bled so bad from picking *anything* and i was clearly not prepared for this much blood.  

i grabbed the nearest tool i could find- a dirty paper towel- and like every army medic in every army movie i've seen, i plunged my hand over the wound and pushed.  pressure!  pressure! the coffee table looks like i used it to try an impromptu dissection of one of the cats and oh shit my jeans dammit i have to clean this up.  there was no way to get to bandages and more cleaning materials without bleeding all over the living room and kitchen floor, so that's exactly what i did.  i spent the next 15-20 minutes bandaging myself and cleaning everything, hobbling around like an old man with the gout, trying (without much success) to not bleed and ruin the work i just did.  we'll see when i get home if i missed anything.

 
edit- clarity.  i am not an army medic

input: Text: for the past few years there has been this indian store nearby my home that sells masala cashews. for those that don't know, they're basically cashews coated in delicious spices, a great snack.

anyways, over the past year or so i've been practicing making these in my home, and i've gotten gradually better at it-- the latest batch being a breakthrough in my spice coating methods. as it would turn out, it would also be a breakthrough in killing my appetite for days.

my mother usually buys these unlabeled cashew packs somewhat cheaply from these indian grocers. i've never had a problem with the quality of the cashews before, but on this fateful past thursday something happened. after making my batch of cashews and enjoying the deliciousness i hid my stash from my brother, who tends to gobble the shit up like crack and dave chappelle. as i didn't use the whole bag of plain cashews my brother turned to eat those when he yelled for me to come see something.

it was a cashew halve, but nestled in the groove was a maggot. upon closer inspection of the bottom half of the bag, several fly type things were crawling about feasting on those cashews. my insides churned up in an instant and maggoty deliciousness met with the inside of a toilet bowl.

input: Text: alright here's a short story about how i drank my own piss.... so a couple times every night i have to get up and take a leak. i live in a loft in this person's house, and every time i leave or enter my room i have to climb up or down this ladder; which is a real pain. the bathroom is downstairs. yesterday i was extremely tired. i was laying in bed ready to go to sleep. suddenly, i got the urge to piss. i was not climbing down that fucking ladder. i had a cup that was empty, so i rolled over, grabbed it, and took a piss in it then just set it on my table and passed out. i wake up at about 6 am in a really foggy state and i'm really thirsty so i grabbed the cup that i pissed in. it was heavy, there must be water in it (i thought). i took a big swig out of it and tasted the most foul liquid i've ever tasted in my life. i immediately spit it back in the cup and realized ""fuck, i just drank my own piss."" i climbed down the ladder and ran to the bathroom and washed my mouth out and brushed my teeth and tongue for like 10 minutes.
piss is disgusting. i cant even imagine what shit must taste like and hope i never fuck up and eat my own shit somehow. i don't think i will. i'm a pretty smart guy. if someone paid me $10,000 i'd probably eat shit though. thanks for reading. moral of the story: don't piss in a fucking cup that you drink water out of and leave it on your table. just get up and go to the fucking bathroom.

input: Text: so this happened yesterday and came to a heed about 10 mins ago.

yesterday i bought some olive oil for my mum, fine, no problems here. so when i placed it on the shelf i knocked over a little container of sweeteners, the little pill like things that go in to tea or coffee. they went everywhere, like, everywhere so that was kinda annoying, but no big deal right?

so i left the house and went to the football and afterwards went to the pub and a night club as you do. lots of fun was had, but i managed to leave my jacket in the club like a total idiot.. again not the end of the world, but it had the house keys in them so this resulted in having to wake up family in the middle of the night to sleep on their couch... at this point i'm now feeling that i'm at dickhead level 100, but hey ho life goes on and i appreciate their help in a time of need.

so this is where the fuck up truly kicks in. my mother comes to see me to tell me she found some money on my family's couch...and then shows me 2 pills that also appeared... i had some drinks last night, but i know for sure that i didn't do anything like that, i'm not interested in that, but fuck me the story really adds up now, drunk guy loses all his stuff, sleeps on family's couch and badaboom badabing drugs in his pocket.

so i spent a while frantically telling my mother that this isn't the case, yeh i was dumb last night and made some silly decisions, but i know 100% i didn't take drugs...then it clicked... those fucking sweeteners!!! i reminded my mum of the sweeteners incident and then opened the tub of them and compared them to the ""drugs"". identical.

thank. fuck.

matched on tinder, arranged meet up, girl looked great, nice butt, was a dancer, pretty good overall. win her over somehow, get to the fucking part.

and boom, the dick starts malfunctioning. after few positions it literally said fuck it. so, i gave up and did plan d, which basically involves rubbing your dick on her ass cheeks.

got to admit, 21 years old, and god damn what an ass. i finally came and i saw the look of regret on her and i could sense i did fuck up.

so, i dropped her and i don't think i will get another fuck chance, i mean i can if i try but i sense i blew it.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so contrary to a lot of the posts on this sub, all of this actually happened today.

so today i started my 30 minute lunch break from my dead end job by making a trip to the decadence that is 7-11. while there, i grabbed a big gulp and 2 slices of their fabulous pizza. why? because $2.22, that's why. just before i hop back into my car an idea pops into my head: ""hey, this delicious meal would pair perfectly with a pre-rolled joint from the local marijuana dispensary down the street!""

now when i say ""down the street"" i actually mean my local dispensary is nowhere near the same path that i took to get to 7-11. it's actually down this hidden road that only people in the area really know about. just so happens to be one of my favorite spots because you can buy your weed, drive to the back, smoke your weed, then just a short hop back to work without seeing more than 5 cars on the way.

so i've made it about half way down this hidden road when i come upon 2 animal control personnel directing traffic around a raccoon in the road. i know what you're thinking. roadkill right? no no this raccoon was just walking in circles, completely oblivious to the world. so after a brief wtf moment  i get to my dispensary, pick up a joint, head to the back, take a few well deserved puffs while thinking about the raccoon, and then start heading back towards work.

i come to the same spot in the road that i had seen the raccoon. this time however there are now police on the scene. i quickly put out my joint and slowly approach the roadblock. as i approach, one of the animal control officers sees me and does this circular motion in the air. stoner me thinks ""yeah there's a raccoon circling in the road, i know lady."" well apparently that is the same motion for turn around and look the other way because not 2 seconds later i watch one of the officers pull out his gun and put two bullets into the raccoon. my mouth (and i'm sure the officer's) drops in amazement as this doesn't even faze the fucking zombie raccoon. the officer fires one more bullet into the poor thing before it finally drops in the road.

here's where the tifu comes into play. 

i was so amazed at the events that had just unfolded during my half hour lunch that i completely forgot that i had just smoked some high quality cannabis. so i get to work and immediately look for someone to tell my story to. so i'm heading toward my office and i notice most of my coworkers  are already gathered there. ""perfect, i'll only have to tell it once.""

i start to tell my story when, about half way through, i realize the mistake i've made: there's no reason for me to be traveling down that road. there's no restaurants, there's no gas station, and there is certainly not a 7-11. there is a dispensary however and i've been warned before about our drug policy at work. thoughts go running through my head about how i might be able to change the location of the zombie raccoon sighting, or just omit the location entirely. i went with the second option and played it off really well all the way until the end of the story. then my boss asks, ""where did this happen?""

shit...

i told him the truth about the location because there really isn't another area around me that this could have happened.

it's approaching 5:00 now and still no further questions from my boss. please hope for the best with me.

i used to work at a chain sports bar and grill. it was pretty common for us to be full whenever there was a big game or fight that wasn't available on local channels. this was one of those nights, not an empty seat in the building. we were showing a football game, and i was waiting tables. i went to use the restroom at some point, and lo and behold, someone had ralphed all over the toilet in the men's room we're in a relatively small town, restaurant seats about 130 or so, so the men's room only had two urinals and one stall. since the stall was rendered useless at this point, someone needed to clean it asap. since i was one of the only people who could clean up vomit without vomiting myself, and since the managers would usually comp my meal if i did, i went to get the cleaning supplies. i noted, however, while the sound from the game was on in the restaurant, the bathrooms were playing music from their speakers. figuring the music was coming from our jukebox, i figured i'd put a dollar in there so i could listen to a song while i cleaned up the pukage. so on the way back to the restroom, i tossed this little diddy on  (http://youtu.be/4ace9idkjo0). well come to find out, for some reason my song took priority over all the speakers in the restaurant. and it played at full fucking blast. i shit you not, the walls were vibrating from the volume. people are getting up, covering their ears, and probably shouting, though you couldn't hear anything but the blasting music. my managers are scrambling at the sound system, and i bolted into the bathroom as fast as i could. the whole thing lasted about a minute, but it was a long-ass minute, believe you me. as soon as i came out, one of my managers comes up to me, laughing. ""hey yosoyelcamaleon, did you see who did that?"" i just looked sheepishly at the floor. he went from laughing to ""...what the fuck dude."" i explained what happened, and he was still pretty pissed, but by the end of the night we were laughing about it.

input: Text: hey guys, what's up? i'm fairly new to reddit, let alone this subreddit in particular. having only just discovered it the other day, i've been thoroughly enjoying myself reading everybody's fuck-ups. looking back on my 21 years of life, i can recall a large quantity of mishaps that would qualify a mention amongst the other hilarious stories in this subreddit. so without further ado, here's one of my most memorable tifu's. although the fuck-up didn't happen today admittedly, it will forever remain a recent memory; imprinted in the forefront of my mind with utmost clarity.

so i'm a nail biter. i'm always biting my nails, whether i'm at work, at home, masturbating, in the bath, playing video games, i'm always biting my nails. so one evening (i believe it was a saturday) i'm sat at my computer playing battlefield, when my arsehole starts ringing with this most almighty itch beyond comprehension. any more itchy and it'd probably have just automatically prolapsed to relieve the pain. so as a result, i let go of my mouse as quickly as you can yell ""wriggling anal worm"", inserting my index finger straight into the unknown depths of my sphincter. 

now for anyone who's not well-versed on anal worms, people who bite their nails are far more likely to contract them. a vast array of dirt, germs, and god-knows-what can linger on the underside of your nails, and as punishment for biting them, worms are born! so i'm sat on my chair in an awkward position, vigorously fingering myself in hopes the itch will subside. once i'm done, i release my finger from my anal cavity, and bring it towards my face. as suspected, amongst a couple of curly hairs on my fingers, are these two or three miniature white penis-shaped specimens going about their business. this isn't the first time this has happened, and being the filthy bastard that i am, i simply shrug it off and wipe my finger on the underside of my computer desk. 

fast-forward to a couple of weeks later. here i am again, sat at my desk; eating pizza (or something equally unhealthy). i manage to drop a slice of pepperoni on the floor, and hastily scramble to pick it up. so i bend down whilst still sat at my seat, gripping the side of my desk with my hand. i pick the slice up with my other hand, and proceed to eat it. shortly after, i begin to play video games again; when i begin to feel this 'presence' on my finger. at this point i've got bullets flying past my head, explosions going off nearby - all of my attention is on the action in front of me. 

this is where i make the worst mistake of my life. one hand's on my mouse, shooting at enemies in the distance, and the other hand has just been inserted into my mouth. i absent-mindedly scrape off whatever's on my finger with my teeth, and... bite down. i hear this crunch, and immediately i know what it is. time slows down, i gently take my finger out of my mouth, and observe the half-eaten worm resting on my saliva-covered finger. 

i jolt upwards, lean out of bedroom window and almost vomit attempting to rid myself of the other half of the worm currently resting on my tongue.

moral of the story? don't.. under any circumstances.. bite your nails. if you absolutely positively have to bite your nails, don't swallow them. if you absolutely positively have to swallow them, don't eat the offspring. please.

first of all, just like most of this thread, this didn't happen today but rather a few days ago. the boyfriend and i decide to get down and dirty on a monday night, have a few shitty drinks and relax. i go to the bathroom right before and realize i'm on my period. no problem, it just started and my first day is light. i'm not about to pass up on sexy time. 

fast forward to the fun part, we were running low on condoms, but there are a few left. i grab one of those shitty minty flavored ones.. not knowing they have sugars in them which isn't a happy time for your love cave.  

next day, telltale burning, but i just assume i had a minor reaction to the condom since we never use the flavored ones. hours later i know it's not just a minor reaction. the itching, burning, hating my life, whole nine yards that comes with a yeast infection. on top of cramps and messy period...

i'm sure all of you know about book fairs at elementary schools, or at least americans probably do.

input: Text: alright, so this is the 2nd time i have done this, you'd think i would have learned my lesson the 1st time.

1st story; happened whenever i was in 8^th grade, i won a writing contest. the top 3 chosen papers in the district were supposed to write a speech at the awards ceremony, however i had no idea about this. i was the last one to go up on the stage, i wandered why they spent so long talking, and i just thought i was going to grab my award and head off of the stage. so i walked up to the stage when they called my name, i shook the principles hand, and then started to head off of the stage. the principle stopped me and said

 ""aren't you going to say your speech?""

 i nodded my head rather slowly, and walked up to the podium. i was just standing there for about five seconds that felt like ages. the only thing i had no idea i was going to have to do this, so my panicking brain just slipped out the words;

 ""dank""

 then the crowd went into a loud uproar of laughter. i glanced back at the principle while walking off the stage and could just feel what he was thinking with that stern look on his face.

2nd story; this one happened yesterday, i placed 4th in the contest and when they passed out awards the top 5 people were supposed to write a speech. i heard a little about others writing their speech but didn't think that i had to do it. so i walked up on the stage again. grabbed my award and then i started to have flashbacks of the 8^th grade. the principle stopped me and said

""your speech?""

""oh"" i sputtered.

though this time, i thought back to all of the dankest of memes i saw on reddit, and remembered a [meme that was relative to my 8th grade experience.](http://i.imgur.com/yu8gfpr.png)

with a slight stutter i said, ""um, i'd like to thank google, and who ever the heck invented copy and paste!"" 

though this time, the crowd didn't burst out into laughter, and just sat there expecting more. 

the principle said into his mic ""now, your actual speech""

then i just swiftly walked off of the stage.

i'm still shaking thinking about this moment.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: right. this is the story of how one pitifully anxious teenage girl spun an intricate web of lies and stories to her father for a lengthy amount of time, slipping deeper and deeper into the grave she dug for herself and progressively feeling more and more like her only options were either *run away* or *kill herself*. (yeah, yeah, i know. an absurd line of thinking, considering everything. then again, all of it's pretty stupid and absurd.)

first, let me offer some context for some of the reasons *why* it seemed necessary in my brain to commit to such a silly series of fabricated tales. my parents divorced when i was around six and a half years old, and after that i would visit my dad at his apartment every other weekend or so. the divorce had certainly affected him in ways i couldn't understand at the time, and he was bitter about a lot of things. it also heavily impacted me, though i was  oblivious to it in a way only a six year old child can be. 

i looked up to my dad. i idolized him. so of course, it hurt me a lot when he would sometimes shoot down the things that interested me. these were casual little instances that probably shouldn't have bothered me in any way, but they did. i'd ask about seeing a movie that looked cool to little ol' me, and he'd scoff and go, ""why would you want to watch something like that?"" i distinctly remember naming my build-a-bear dinosaur lance, and my father looking me with a heavy air of condescension and asking, ""what kind of name is lance?"" 

things like that. i know he never meant to hurt me, or make me feel the way he did. i have zero doubts that my dad loves me with all his heart. but between the rickety situation back home with my mom and new stepfather and the sudden sensation that my dad was going to disapprove of or hate everything i like, i adopted a sort of mindset that demanded that i keep all of my interests to myself. 

for the following years as i grew up, i stuck to this mindset like my entire existence depended on it around him (and later, the woman he met and married). visitations were always stressful because i felt like a stranger in my own skin around him, terrified of him possibly seeing who i was as a developing teenager. i was convinced he would scoff at me just like he did when i was a kid.

skip to the end of my sophomore year of high school. through a series of really, really shitty circumstances, i ended up dropping out from public high school because i severely lacked the emotional and mental capacity required for it at that point. i then found myself in a program called ""homebound,"" which was essentially for kids who for whatever reason couldn't physically attend the high school, so a teacher would come out two or three times a week to your home and deliver school work and serve as a tutor for those classes. 

whenever i would visit my dad during the school year, he would pick me up from school on a friday and i'd stay the weekend on most occasions. however, once i began homebound, i was too scared to tell him i was no longer physically going to the high school. so, instead of explaining to him that i was struggling with situational depression and anxiety and being honest like a normal human being, what did i do? lied. every other weekend when he wanted to pick me up from school, i somehow managed to get away with saying, ""oh, it was early release today, so just pick me up at the house."" 

or: ""we didn't have school today. some school faculty thing, i dunno."" 

or: ""i had an appointment this morning and just didn't go back."" 

my dad trusted me, like a father should, and in his mind he had zero reason not to. 

once the summer came, i was relieved. no more lying. i planned on going back to public school the next year and i thought i could just pretend like those few months never even happened. 

of course things didn't go as i planned. i tried for about a month my junior year before dropping out again. i went back into the same homebound program. and naturally, i still felt i couldn't tell my dad any of this. same thing as before. awkward, sketchy lying.

i'd be sitting at the dinner table with my father and stepmom, and i'd tell them stories about ""school."" i'd tell them about friends who didn't exist, pep rallies that i didn't attend, drama that i never saw. i'd tell them about teachers and projects that were never assigned to me. i literally crafted this entire school life that didn't exist just so that i could continue under the guise that i was the perfect, normal teenage girl they wanted me to be. my dad was always stressing the importance of doing well, and one time i lied and said i made a 84 on a test, and i guess a b- didn't fly in his book either because he was disappointed about that too. this reaffirmed in my mind the notion that i could absolutely never tell him what was really going on.


this scared me *shitless*. i didn't know what i was gonna do. i kept hoping that maybe i could get away and everything would be alright. that they would both forever remain oblivious to my web of lies. i would literally cry on the nights before having to go to my dad's, because keeping up with everything was so stressful. there was this perpetual weight of dread in my chest, holding me down everywhere i went because it was forever present in the back of my mind.

now we're approaching my senior year. i'd had a lot of issues with the homebound program, failing a couple classes almost entirely due to teacher and administration error, but that's an entirely different story to get into. basically, my mom decided that it wasn't going to be acceptable for the next year, so we began looking into online classes. in the end, i got a partial scholarship for the university of texas high school online, which was pretty cool. 

here's the fun thing: me, being me, decided i'd just pretend i was still going to the same public high school when in the face of my father. don't ask me what i thought was going to happen, i had no idea either. i knew he would be expecting a graduation. he'd continuously asked for my report card which i always awkwardly ducked away from. i had no idea what i was going to do, but at that point, it was set in stone that he would inevitably find out the truth. 

one weekend i saw him, a bit before i was about to start my online classes, and i told him and my stepmom that i'd just started public school. i had created a fake series of classes i was attending, gushed about an elective i had never signed up for, and basically did what i'd been doing. then, about two days after i return home, i hear it. the nuclear bomb i'd been waiting for, the one i knew couldn't be avoided but prayed to all gods that may or may not exist would never come: my mom, casually informing me, ""hey, i just sent your dad an email about uths.""

my insides burned. every molecule in my body screeched and trembled. the mini-mes inside my head were running around in blind panic, yelling at one another, sliding down the metaphorical walls of my brain and breaking down. naturally i respond with the cool reserve any individual silently dying inside does. ""oh, cool.""

i'm done for. this is it. this is the end. in my mind, the soul-crushing apocalypse had just arrived. i'd quite literally been at my dad's two days ago, shitting lies out my ass like i'd just taken a handful of those sugar-free haribo gummy bears, and now i was bestowed with the knowledge that my father would be receiving an email from my mom that fully contradicted everything i'd told him.

i was so full of panic and despair at that point, i found myself  thinking that my only options left were to either literally pack my bags and run away, or kill myself or somehow fake my death. absolutely ridiculous thoughts. then again, continuing to lie about something so trivial for that long was equally as ridiculous.

i ended up talking to one of my only friends at the time and confessing everything. she coached me through writing an email to him explaining everything and being brutally honest... so i did precisely that. i spilled my guts, apologized excessively, and begged for forgiveness in my email to him. so, now not only would my father be getting an email from my mom saying i was going to an online school he'd never heard of, he was also receiving an email from his daughter which was written in a tone that sounded a lot like i'd murdered twelve people and was finally confessing to my crimes. (it was a very, *very* dramatic email in retrospect.)

the next day came, i woke up with the same anvil of dread choking my lungs, and i found myself walking on eggshells waiting for the text or phone call or my mother's voice asking me what the fuck was up.

nothing. 

i nearly shit myself as an entire day passed and i heard nothing. then another passed. and another. there for a little bit, i thought maybe we were all just going to pretend nothing happened and everyone was cool. no such luck, obviously. my mom told me that my dad was coming to town and wanted to speak to me, so i guess they'd been talking to each other in private.

the rest isn't really worth mentioning. my father and i talked, i came clean and basically explained everything with a heavy amount of shame and embarrassment, and about four terribly awkward conversations later, we were all good. my dad and stepmom were nothing but supportive and mostly just sad that i hadn't felt comfortable discussing my issues with them. i felt stupid, but let me tell you. there's probably no better feeling in this world than carrying that kind of dread and heaviness for that long only to find that everyone still loved you in the end.

input: Text: obligatory ""this happened last night."" my wife and i have a 3 year old, but for the first time in about a year, we finally had a babysitter, my mother-in-law (we live in louisiana, 100% of our family lives up north), so we decided to take advantage of it. we meet up with a few friends, start at one bar, have a few drinks, everything's peachy. at this point, it's about 1:30 am and (sidenote: i haven't been drunk in about a year, so 2 very talls beers in, i was already feeling it) i'm pretty much gone to the world. i turn into the ""i'm so drunk"" person, letting the entire bar know that i am, in fact, drunk. i despised those kids in high school, but lo and behold, i had it in me all along. 

anyways, i'm talking to a bunch of people at the bar and i can tell my wife is ignoring me a little bit, which i think it's because she's not having a good time, but really, i was just annoying and embarrassing the hell out of her. so, in my drunken stupor, i proceed to ask the bartender over and over, ""good sir, how much would it cost to buy out the entire bar?"" he wouldn't tell me. i ask again. still no answer. at this point, i do find the manager, ask him and he tells me, ""we're open for another hour, so if you do want to buy the bar, it'll be about $5,000."" (i later learned there was about $400 worth of alcohol left) i tell him, ""perfect! that's how much i have in my savings. let me contact my bank or if you want to hold onto my info, i'll give you the money."" he agrees and tells me to talk to the bartender. thankfully, my wife eventually catches on, realizes what i'm asking, tries to stop me, but i think i'm king of the mountain at this point and the coolest thing to do would be to shout ""drinks are on me!"" everyone did cheer and my wife gave me the look of ""if i could divorce you right now, i would."" there was a small miracle when one of my friends shouted ""no. he's kidding. he's being an asshole right now."" i got a few boo's, then we made a b-line for the door. my wife won't talk to me the entire cab ride home. once we get through the door, i begin to loudly whisper ""shorts! i need shorts to sleep!"" which wakes up my child.

today, i'm now on the apology tour and my wife, while she has said ""you're a terrible drunk. you can't act like that again"" to me about 20 times, she's still very angry with me.
output: ","TIFU by offering family savings to buy out the entire bar, all while embarrassing my wife and being white boy wasted."

my girlfriend and i went to get sushi- and of course sake bombs- the other night. she was on her period, so to compensate for the lack of sex we decided to drink... a lot.

we got back to my apartment and she started begging me to lay into her. being the forward thinking man that i am, we laid down a towel and proceeded to make her cry til the cows came home.

fast forward a week later and my girlfriend is having consistent stomach cramps and feels unwell. remembering the night of ill-advised passion, we discussed the possibility of leaving the tampon in during sex. she was freaking out and i put on my best deep sea fisher face and tried to hook that bad boy out of her vag.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so this technically did happen today, although my story starts yesterday. last night i went to a party with a girl i have been seeing for a few weeks now, it was at her friends house and we both had a great time. we drank and danced by the fire, and i met many new and fun people. by the time the night was over we were both feeling pretty tipsy and i walk her back to her place, she invites me to stay the night and i obviously accept.
 
we were both feeling quite frisky and we started making out in her bed. a few minutes later (after i attempted to touch her lady parts) she mentions that she is on her period, so instead of having sex (we haven't had sex yet), she offers to give me a blow job, saying that she likes it and is good at it (she is). not being a moron, i accept. so she goes downtown and it was absolutely amazing, probably the best i had ever had, i don't know how she did it, but she managed to make it last a solid 20 minutes. she would bring me right close to orgasm and then slow down, every time she did that it felt more and more intense, it was the most passionate and beautiful blow job i ever had. it's silly to say, but we connected on a very deep level during that blow job.

and so, finally i came, simultaneously ripping one of the loudest, most obnoxious farts i had ever heard coming out of my anus. right into her face. i had no idea where the hell that came from and i instinctively pushed her head away in embarrassment, leaving my cumming penis free to spew semen all over her, my chest, her bed, and probably her ceiling. i was still in the midst of an orgasm and so my ass followed up with a second, equally violent and unreal flatulence, by then my mind was overloaded with confusion, embarrassment, and pure bliss from the orgasm that was still occurring. the only thing i could do was leave my ego behind and burst out laughing, causing pressure in my intestines which made me fart, again, a third and final time, this one just as strong as the two others.

we both lay there on the bed, covered in semen, i'm laughing and crying for what seemed to be hours while she remain confused, after which she asks me if i shit the bed, to which i answer that i didn't think so. we clean up and, surprisingly, she is still horny after that and gives me another blow job, this time i came without incident. then we fell asleep. her parents room is right next to hers so i'm sure they heard the whole ordeal, especially my farts. this morning was a little awkward with them.

so i go up to him and say oh man, i'm sorry, that's terrific.

and then he gives me [this face](http://media.giphy.com/media/cqtlhd48eg0sy/giphy.gif) looking at me with the most angered and astonished face i've ever seen.

the 2 co-workers look at me and say ""what's wrong with you blindman0909!""

i don't understand and i sit back down and finish my day.

i ask my friend from here, and he says dude terrific means good and terrible is empathetic.

here i am sitting feeling bad.

today my neighbor asked for me to cut a 3/4 inch steel bar for a tractor of his. i agreed and took the bar back to my shop where my angle grinder is. i locked it in the vise with confidence and slapped on newer cut off disc. as i cut downwards into the bar i realized that metal dust was fragmenting into my tool box. i decided to cut upwards into the bar to prevent this. 

if you're not familiar with using an angle grinder you wouldn't know that you never want to cut upwards into something like this. i did. i was being an idiot.

i was 90% into my upwards cut of the steel rod when suddenly the weight of the bar caused it to pinch the cut off disc. this instantaneously launched the angle grinder back at me.  without a second to realize it was happening the grinder chassis grabbed my shirt and swung with the force of an nfl kicker into my family jewels. 

this forced me to let go of the grinder and keel forward in pain. letting go of the grinder allowed it grab my t-shirt with the disc and pulled towards my groin. i grabbed grinder chassis but at this point it was pulling my shirt into it harder than i could fight. i felt humming through my arms as the motor on the grinder locked up. 

afraid to let go of the grinder i pulled it away from my abdomen stretching my shirt beyond limit. it felt like i was holding a pit bull by its jaws as it tried to maul me. i managed to quickly back up pulling the power cord out of the wall socket. the garage went silent. i had a vietnam style flash back to every final destination scene i have watched.

i will never ever make an upwards cut into an unsupported anything ever again.

i attached photos of my shirt and just how close i came to amputating my own dick. i was horrified and considering i use the angle grinder every single day i am now terrified with the fact i did something so stupid. for the record i wore my safety glasses. 😂

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: tifu. so, recently i started speaking to this girl. let's call her hilary. she's very funny, and very smart and we get on great. she's been messaging me every day since we started talking for about 2 weeks. we have only been texting and messaging each other on fb.
today, i came home to find a message from said girl's boyfriend saying;
""hey dude, i just wanted to make sure that you know i am going out with hilary. i don't mind you messaging her or whatever, but i wanted to give you the heads up so that you don't say anything inappropriate. if you do then we will have a problem. thanks.""
personally, i never talk to girls who have boyfriends, but she only told me she had one after this chump threatened me. after speaking to her about him, she told me that she would 'be up all night tonight and she will talk to me then' as i have a tendency to stay up late.
anyway, that was all fine and good until... i accidentally sent him a screenshot of his message that he sent me, with his details scratched out with the words 'what an insecure b*tch' scrawled over it. so, after shitting myself and sending that, i went on to the message to check and he has indeed seen it. to make matters worse, my location is visible to him on the messages.
he's not replied.
i have two options.
1 - give an excuse as to why i sent it to him,
""i just wanted to check that you wouldn't mind me sending this to my brother, as he wanted to see what you've said. that cool with you?""
bullshit and juvenile, not to mention the p*ssay way to deal with things.
2- tear the shit out of him for being an insecure bf. for example;
""i would say your girlfriend is a 9/10 all things considered... but now that i get the chance you destroy your life in my attempt to 'woo' her i'd rate her a 10/10 mate.
i already know she can speak in a multitude of different languages... her french accent is right turn on don't you agree, still surprised how fluent she is with a pair of balls in her mouth...""
i prefer this idea, as it's more manly and i think it would be hilarious.
what do you guys think? looking for some advice?

input: Text: unlike some fuck-ups on this sub-reddit, this fuck up happened today. 

i was sitting on the toilet, taking a shit and playing on my phone to fight boredom, and i suddenly decided to find out what boku no pico was like (it was disgusting). 

see, i hadn't taken a dump in 2 weeks, so i was pretty constipated. 

so, i turn down the volume so my family doesn't hear what i'm watching, and i start producing vile, disgusting boiled food. and let me tell you, this was the worst shit of my life. 

as i'm taking a dump, i squeeze the phone because of the pain and i accidentally press the volume up button. shit. this was the first mistake. 

the phone was now blasting all the hot gay pedophilic action through it's speakers for all of my family to hear. 

the second mistake was that in my struggle to turn the volume down, i somehow dropped the phone underneath my pants. i finally picked up the phone and turned the volume down, but by then i heard my mom yelling ""what the fuck was that?!"" 

in an attempt to make this situation better, i yelled out ""nothing, mom, don't worry about it"". third mistake.

i wiped as fast as i could and ran to my room immediately. now i am sitting on my bed, sharing this story with you guys. didn't even flush. 

i'm going out in a few minutes to talk to my mom, and i will update you guys later, after i get over the fact that i have embarrassed myself in front of my own family, and the fact that my anus now has the width of a jar.

anyway, i put some on my neck and shoulders and just lay down in bed until i fall asleep.
i wake up in the middle of the night because my face and the corner of my eyes are just burning. i get up and see that my whole face is red and at this point my eyes are starting to water.

that is when i realized that i used way to much cream and as i laid down it got all over the pillow. i rolled over at night and the cream rubbed all over my face and part of my eyes. 
my skin was super irritated, specially because my face is very sensitive. 
needless to say, i went to work with swollen eyes.

i had been hanging out with a friend at her dorm but had to leave for class. as i walked towards the area where the elevators and stairs were i noticed two or three really attractive girls waiting for the elevator. i didn't think much of it and started making my way towards the stairs. as i was about to open the door to the stairwell i hear one of the girls call out to me and say ""hey the elevator is here"". i turn around and see them holding the door open for me. i stared at them for a second or two and just said ""but i like stairs"". the girls obviously weren't expecting me to say that and they just stared at me for a few seconds while still holding the elevator door open. i then turned around and began to take the stairs. as i was half way through the second flight i realized what i had done. i always wondered if i had taken that elevator maybe i would have befriended those girls or dated one of them or something. then again i'm pretty sure they were out of my league but oh well.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this happened a couple of hours ago. i'm hiding in my cubicle right now. 

i work at a transport company, and they use an excel file to keep track of all the trucks, and what they are doing. they do that for all 80 trucks, every single day. so it's an enormous file. this morning i was checking my e-mail, with that excel file on my right screen, and an important e-mail on the left. this e-mail was telling me something went wrong with a truck yesterday, and to check it in the excel file. so i was clicking away happily in the excel file and decided it would be a great idea to print out the e-mail, so i can archive it and everything. so i press ctrl+p.

and that's where it went wrong. right before that, i printed an invoice, for which we use a different kind of paper. one with a logo and pretty colours, stuff like that. so the lovely system automatically used that lay-out. and remember how i was happily clicking away in the excel file? not the e-mail? and then clicked ctrl+p? yeah.

so the computer starts printing the excel file, consisting of over 3000 pages, on the super-duper expensive invoice paper instead of the normal blank paper. the invoice paper costs a little over 1 euro per paper. and i had no idea. i thought i printed the e-mail, on normal paper. i could hear the printer going in the main office, and i figured: o, someone else is also printing some files, that's why it takes so long. and being the lazy fuck i am, i didn't go and check. until the printer went 'beep beep beep', meaning it ran out of paper. hmm, that's odd. someone is printing quite a lot. the printer can hold up to 500 pages at once, so damn, quite a big file they're printing! well, that's fine by me. and still being a lazy fuck, i do not go and replace the papers in the now empty drawer. my lovely coworker does that. also, not checking what has been printed. because why would you, right? 

so, 15 minutes later, 'beep beep beep'. what the hell? at this point i did get kind off worried. i mean, the first time the printer ran out of paper, was not so odd. maybe the paper drawer hadn't been completely full. but this time it was! still, i'm a lazy fuck, so i do not get up my butt to check. nope, i just let my coworker refill the paper drawer for the 2nd time. and then my coffee-fueled mind starts to work. you know how you get a notice on your computer when you printed something, with how many pages and everything? yeah, i also click those away instantly. because hell, i know what i just printed, right? fuck. i'm a real idiot with computers, so i had no idea how to check my printing history. i feel a little sweat breaking out. god, no, i did not print the excel file, did i?

at this point i almost run to the printer and see the enormous stack of invoice paper on the printer, spewing all over the floor as well, and still happily printing. shaking, i pick up one paper and yes, there it is, a nice overview of what one particular truck did one day in 2014. i squeal and start mashing the buttons on the printer, while hysterically whispering ""stop stop stooop stop stooooop stop"". it must've been quite a sight. eventually the printer understands what i want and stops printing, but not before he let outs a mocking 'beep beep beep'. 

so, it printed close to 1500 worthless papers, on freaking expensive invoice paper. which i could just... throw away.

and you know what the worst thing is? nobody believed it was an accident. you see, tomorrow is my last day at the office. so everyone thought this was a 'going-away joke'. one half of my coworkers thought it was quite funny, the other half was really annoyed. but worst of all, the manager is fucking furious, and told me he will never give out a positive reference to future employers. luckily i did already get another job (otherwise i would not have been leaving the office) so i'm settled nonetheless. but still. damn it.

input: Text: so i'm laying on the couch, pretty hungover, 2 pm, and drinking a ton of coffee playing around on my laptop and realize that i'm absolutely starving. i felt like crap though so didn't want to leave my house, and decided that ordering a pizza would be a pretty good way to solve my problem. so i do. they tell me it'll take about an hour. 

about 30 minutes later i suddenly get really horny and figure fuck it, i'll hole up in my room and find some great porn and pull one off before pizza guy gets here. yeahhhhhh, turns out my wank sesh lasted a bit longer than anticipated, and i get a call saying that the pizza guy was here, so i throw on some pants and go grab the pizza.

firstly let me mention as a side note that watching porn while eating pizza isn't really the most satisfying combination. somehow it makes the pizza seem a little, i don't know..... dirty? lol anyway, basically i'm sitting in my computer chair next to my bed, which has the opened box of pizza on it, a slice of pizza in hand, watching porn. shortly after finishing the slice, i advance to the crescendo of my jerking frenzy, and jizz.

here's the thing. i usually don't shoot very far, but i must've not jerked for a few days and not realized how much was stored in my mansack, but no fucking shit, the first spurt shot like 3 fucking feet, right in the direction of the pizza box. 

so here i am, post jerk clarity settling in, looking around frantically on the floor and bed trying to locate where the stray dick-spittle ended up. it's nowhere to be seen. i eyeball the shit out of the pizza, but to no avail. i'd seen it though. i definitely saw a spurt of it fly right towards the pizza. it was on there. i guess it kind of soaked into the hot greasy mess somewhere and was no longer visible. i was still hungry damnit.

no way in hell i'm gonna waste a whole pizza though :d

i didn't know what to say, so i just laughed with that deer in the headlights look. and then, over her shoulder, i made eye contact with the hairy guy on the crunch machine (who was making that oh snap that just happened face), and the lady going 2 miles an hour on the treadmill (and she almost tripped anyway), and the gym manager (who i needed to talk to about extending my membership), who was training this lady with shoes that were way too pink, though not as pink as my cheeks were.

i had no where to run, no where to hide. i didn't even leave the johnny bravo pose i was sporting, i was paralyzed, with a major case of shrinkage to top it off.

the lady who opened the door just said ""hello!!"" in a sarcastic sort of way, and the door slammed shut. and then i heard a wave of laughter. it lasted for at least 20 seconds. i stayed in that bathroom for 20 minutes.

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: this is the story of how at only 12 years old, i committed a felony.


i was on a cruise ship, and i was hanging out in the arcade at around 12:30 a.m, bored out of my mind. i was with my cousin, and neither of us had any tickets left, and our parents cut off our spending. i found a ticket on the floor, and as a joke decided to jam it in the prize machines receipt slot. then, i printed a receipt for one ticket to try to push it out. when that didn't work, i finally got it out with my finger, and two receipts came out, each for one ticket. i was confused, then realized, i had just cloned a ticket!
   

i later figured out how it works. when i printed out the receipt, i blocked it from coming out. the machine doesn't realize it came out, so it lets you print another one, and then you clone those tickets too.
  

i then proceeded to use this to my advantage, buying out a bunch of prizes. i also let some of the other kids in the arcade in on it, and we basically emptied the prize machine. after that, everything started to fall apart.  
 

 more and more kids started to find out, and would do it right in front of the arcade staff. when the staff started noticing something was going on, they started paying more attention. at one point, i noticed one recording me on his phone, and i ran away as fast as i could. i would see them standing next to the machines all day, watching every kid carefully. i saw one machine open, and the guy was trying to fix it. i found out from a friend that they had caught some kid with a receipt for 300,000 tickets, when the most expensive prize was 2,500 tickets. the guy said to him, ""hey, that's illegal, kid."" and took him to their office.
  

  i avoided the arcade after that, but it was too late. when me and my family were coming back on to the ship from nassau, they were scanning our cards. they scanned mine, and the screen read, 'denied'. a crew member brought me to the cruise ship directors office, or whoever it is that runs the jail. he said to me, ""we know what you did."" i thought they might be bluffing, and acted confused. but then he took out a receipt for 300,000 tickets, and i realized i was done for. 


he told me what he had found out, and he said this. ""so,  what we know is, one kid found a glitch in the machine, and he started showing people how to do it. and then he showed you, is that correct?"". i realized i had a way out and said, ""yes, that's right. that kid started the whole thing. a lot of the kids didn't know how he did it, he just gave them prizes and tickets."" 
  

 the director made me return my prizes and tickets, and said that if i ever went back to the arcade, they would contact authorities. some of the other kids involved thanked me for not throwing them under the bus. i later found out the so-called ""ringleader"" was charged with a felony. they never found out that it was me.

update: i found an old journal entry, and apparently the director told me that we racked up 1.3 million tickets from the glitch. i remembered one of the toys, a remote control robot, cost 2000 tickets, and i did the math. i could have gotten 650 robots, and each robot sells for $20, so we potentially could have taken $13,000 worth of toy robots.
output: ","TIFU by accidentally starting a criminal empire, and almost getting charged with a felony."

Now complete the following example-
input: Text: so i've been babysitting these kids (f8, f6) for as long as i can remember and every. single. day. they eat the same shit. ego waffles with peanut butter for breakfast, and ramen for lunch. 
for some reason, today, i thought that i would mix it up and make some grilled cheese. 
supposedly i don't know how to make grilled cheese. 
i let the pan heat up on the stove, and when it was hot, i put butter on it, and stuck the bread on top of that. i turned my back for a few seconds to get more butter and turn back around to see the bread literally on fire. 
i didn't even know bread was flammable so you can see why this was upsetting. 
i'm not a screamer, and i'm pretty calm in threatening situations, but i did squeeze the butter so hard it fell all over the floor. naturally, i yelled out and told the kids to stay out of the kitchen. dumb on my part because they came running over and screaming and the older one actually slipped on the fallen butter so now there is crying too. 
to sum it all up i ended up making grilled cheese by making a cheese sandwich and heating it up in the microwave. 
also planning to tell my employer that the kids are delusional and i would never start a fire in the house (she pays me $10/hr i will not lose this gig) 
but the picture i have of the bread after the fire was put out was worth the stress pimples i'll probably wake up with tomorrow.

input: Text: posting this under a throwaway account because there’s not a chance in hell i will do so under my usual account. too embarrassing.

so, today i was playing bloodborne. for those of you who don't know what i'm talking about, bloodborne is a difficult, challenging videogame that requires concentration and skill. the game also has two online multiplayer options: an aggressive one in which you can invade another player to kill them, and a cooperation one in which you can ask/offer help to another player.

i personally prefer the co-op, so i often offer my help. 
an unwritten rule of the game is that once you get beckoned by someone in their game, you shouldn't go afk or leave, since asking for help actually requires precious in-game points and quite a bit of waiting to be connected with someone.

so today i was doing my usual round of co-oping, helping people slay bosses and stuff. for a couple of hours my stomach has been rumbling, but i thought nothing of it, since i'm near my period and my stomach always get a little grumpy in this time frame. 
i've also been very gassy. this is -sadly- important.

i get beckoned by someone. we exchange the usual round of in-game gestures to greet each other before getting down to business and go beat up the boss. as the battle starts, i lean a little bit on a side to relieve some gas.

and promptly shit myself.

it was so sudden and unexpected that i froze,  and my character stopped on the spot for a second. the boss punched the shit out of me. i got back to my senses and dodged, curing myself. 

there's no fucking way i'm leaving this poor fella dealing alone against the boss. so i sit there for a good five minutes, helping a guy with one of the hardest boss of the game (orphan of kos) with shit in my pants.

victory achieved. i bid farewell to my beckoner and run to the bathroom.

thank god the chair didn't get stained...
