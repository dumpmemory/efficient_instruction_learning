Now complete the following example-
input: Erlich:  Yeah , we 're gon na win even if I have to go into the auditorium and personally jerk off every guy in the audience .
Jared: That 's a lot of jerking .
Gilfoyle: And we only have ten minutes to present . So ...
Richard: So , we 're fucked , are n't we ?
Dinesh: Yeah , even if he 's jerking _ two _ at a time , there are , what , 800 guys in that room ? So that 's 400 times whatever the mean jerk - time is .
Jared: The what ?
Dinesh: Mean jerk - time . I mean , it does n't matter , but , hypothetically , time is equal to 400 total jerks at a two - dick rate .
Gilfoyle: Unless Erlich jerks off four guys at a time , and then we can cut that in half .
Dinesh: How would he do four guys ... ? He 's got two hands , so that 's two dicks at a time , right ?
Gilfoyle: Look , you have two guys on either side with their dicks , tip to tip , so you 're going full - length . Four , see ?
Jared: Oh ... From the middle out . That does make sense .
Gilfoyle: Like two Shake Weights .
Dinesh: Yeah , so what we 're trying to do , hypothetically , is minimize which is 800 dudes , multiplied by mean - jerk time , divided by four dicks at a time . Of course , Erlich would have to pre - sort guys by height , so that their dicks lined up .
Gilfoyle: Not by height , technically . The measurement that we 're looking for , really , is dick to floor . Call that D2F.
Erlich: You know , if a guy 's dick was long enough , it would be able to reach up or down to another guy with a different D2F. The longer the dick , the greater the D2F bridge , but I would still be able to jerk it off in one smooth motion ... I 'd just have to jerk it on an angle .
Gilfoyle: So D2F sub-1 needs to equal D2F sub-2 , and D2F sub-3 needs to equal D2F sub-4 , where length L creates a complimentary shaft angle . Call that theta D. Now , the orgasm threshold ... as a function of Lamda sub ...
Jared: Guys , does girth - similarity affect Erlich 's ability to jerk different dicks simultaneously ?
Erlich: Shit . Yeah , I think it would .
Erlich: Of course , it does . Time to orgasm , or T2O , has to be the same for each matching pair of dicks otherwise I 'm wasting a lot of great strokes on a guy that 's already busted .
Gilfoyle: Unless you can hotswap dicks in and out . So on a downstroke , you get a new one in . So when you stroke up you 're not wasting any energy .
Dinesh: Even so . I think this is the most reliable metric for stamina .
Erlich: Let
Erlich: me ask you something . How fast do you think you could jack off every guy in this room ? 'Cause I know how long it would take me . And I can prove it .

input: President John Sheridan:  The universe speaks in many languages but only one voice . The langage is not Narn or human or Centauri or Gaim or Minbari . It speaks in the language of hope .
G'Kar: It speaks in the language of trust . It speaks in the language of strength and the language of compassion . It is the language of the heart and the language of the soul . But always it is the same voice . It is the voice of our ancestors speaking through us . And the voice of our inheritors waiting to be born . It is the small , still voice that says : "" We are one . "" No matter the blood , no matter the skin , no matter the world , no matter the star : we are one . No matter the pain , no matter the darkness , no matter the loss , no matter the fear : we are one . Here gathered together in common cause we agree to recognize this singular truth and this singular rule : that we must be kind to one another .
President John Sheridan: Because each voice enriches us and ennobles us , and each voice lost , diminishes us . We are the voice of the universe , the soul of creation , the fire that will light the way to a better future . We are one .
G'Kar: We are _ one _ .

input: Film Brain:  I 'm going to put this briefly , because I 've said everything I wanted to say already . This is a hateful , sexist movie that operates in a complete moral vacuum that is painfully unfunny , largely due to the smug , overracted performance of Dane Cook , who fails to be likeable . The sex is a coarse and uncomfortable fit with the mean - spirited slapstick comedy and the script is astonishingly dumb . Dan Fogler delivers the worst comedy performance I 've ever seen . I HATED this offensively terrible movie . The fact that this got made in _ 2007 _ is frankly astonishing .

Emily Prentiss: Arsonists draw attention to themselves through the fires they set . The locations they choose are highly symbolic to them . While this unsub will never set an actual fire , he has the same psychosis as _ one _ who does .
Dr. Spencer Reid: Our unsub fits that model . His locations have been pillars of the community . The victims he picks are n't as important as the effect of killing them outside of your favorite restaurant or place of worship .
Derek Morgan: By picking locales with the highest visibility , he 's creating the highest level of fear in that neighborhood , which reinforces his feeling of power .
Detective Jake Moreland: Yeah , but arsonists do n't set out to hurt people . This guy clearly does .
Derek Morgan: That 's true . And this unsub definitely falls in the category of sociopath .
Emily Prentiss: His victims are there only to achieve his goal . He does n't have the ability to empathize with them . To him , they 're just ... tools for him to use , no different than a can of gasoline and a match .
David Rossi: But even how he kills tells us something . Slashing a throat is a messy , visual act . It 's designed to create attention , just like a fire .
Dr. Spencer Reid: Arsonists are often mission based . They need to make sure their first fire has burnt out before they set another one . They 're also highly disciplined and focused . If conditions are n't right to set a fire or , in this case , slash a throat , they 'll move on .
Aaron Hotchner: In addition to his need to kill , he has self - control . He has a short cooling off period because he 's enjoying what he 's doing . This in turn feeds his ego and keeps him covering his tracks .
David Rossi: This makes him even more dangerous . If he gets frustrated , encounters too many obstacles , or suffers a blow to his narcissistic ego , he could go on an all - out rampage .

Woman #1: What IS anorexia nervosa ?
Narrator: Anorexia nervosa is a condition of self starvation , which affects mostly women in their adolescence or young adulthood . Sufferers desperately want to be thin , and often transform their bodies to such an extent that menstruation ceases , and they revert to a pre - pubescent stage .
Woman #2: Do anorexics ever get hungry ?
Narrator: The term anorexia means lack of appetite , yet those who suffer from it are obsessed with food and its preparation , while they deny their own hunger and their body 's need for nutrients .
Woman #3: Do they really think they look attractive like that ?
Narrator: Anorectics often have a distorted perception of their actual body size . Although experts still can not account for this basic misrecognition , they do point out that the rigorous self discipline imposed by the anorectic is often the cause of an extreme exhilaration or high which accompanies and rewards her denial of food .
