input: Erlich:  Yeah , we 're gon na win even if I have to go into the auditorium and personally jerk off every guy in the audience .
Jared: That 's a lot of jerking .
Gilfoyle: And we only have ten minutes to present . So ...
Richard: So , we 're fucked , are n't we ?
Dinesh: Yeah , even if he 's jerking _ two _ at a time , there are , what , 800 guys in that room ? So that 's 400 times whatever the mean jerk - time is .
Jared: The what ?
Dinesh: Mean jerk - time . I mean , it does n't matter , but , hypothetically , time is equal to 400 total jerks at a two - dick rate .
Gilfoyle: Unless Erlich jerks off four guys at a time , and then we can cut that in half .
Dinesh: How would he do four guys ... ? He 's got two hands , so that 's two dicks at a time , right ?
Gilfoyle: Look , you have two guys on either side with their dicks , tip to tip , so you 're going full - length . Four , see ?
Jared: Oh ... From the middle out . That does make sense .
Gilfoyle: Like two Shake Weights .
Dinesh: Yeah , so what we 're trying to do , hypothetically , is minimize which is 800 dudes , multiplied by mean - jerk time , divided by four dicks at a time . Of course , Erlich would have to pre - sort guys by height , so that their dicks lined up .
Gilfoyle: Not by height , technically . The measurement that we 're looking for , really , is dick to floor . Call that D2F.
Erlich: You know , if a guy 's dick was long enough , it would be able to reach up or down to another guy with a different D2F. The longer the dick , the greater the D2F bridge , but I would still be able to jerk it off in one smooth motion ... I 'd just have to jerk it on an angle .
Gilfoyle: So D2F sub-1 needs to equal D2F sub-2 , and D2F sub-3 needs to equal D2F sub-4 , where length L creates a complimentary shaft angle . Call that theta D. Now , the orgasm threshold ... as a function of Lamda sub ...
Jared: Guys , does girth - similarity affect Erlich 's ability to jerk different dicks simultaneously ?
Erlich: Shit . Yeah , I think it would .
Erlich: Of course , it does . Time to orgasm , or T2O , has to be the same for each matching pair of dicks otherwise I 'm wasting a lot of great strokes on a guy that 's already busted .
Gilfoyle: Unless you can hotswap dicks in and out . So on a downstroke , you get a new one in . So when you stroke up you 're not wasting any energy .
Dinesh: Even so . I think this is the most reliable metric for stamina .
Erlich: Let
Erlich: me ask you something . How fast do you think you could jack off every guy in this room ? 'Cause I know how long it would take me . And I can prove it .

input: President John Sheridan:  The universe speaks in many languages but only one voice . The langage is not Narn or human or Centauri or Gaim or Minbari . It speaks in the language of hope .
G'Kar: It speaks in the language of trust . It speaks in the language of strength and the language of compassion . It is the language of the heart and the language of the soul . But always it is the same voice . It is the voice of our ancestors speaking through us . And the voice of our inheritors waiting to be born . It is the small , still voice that says : "" We are one . "" No matter the blood , no matter the skin , no matter the world , no matter the star : we are one . No matter the pain , no matter the darkness , no matter the loss , no matter the fear : we are one . Here gathered together in common cause we agree to recognize this singular truth and this singular rule : that we must be kind to one another .
President John Sheridan: Because each voice enriches us and ennobles us , and each voice lost , diminishes us . We are the voice of the universe , the soul of creation , the fire that will light the way to a better future . We are one .
G'Kar: We are _ one _ .

input: Film Brain:  I 'm going to put this briefly , because I 've said everything I wanted to say already . This is a hateful , sexist movie that operates in a complete moral vacuum that is painfully unfunny , largely due to the smug , overracted performance of Dane Cook , who fails to be likeable . The sex is a coarse and uncomfortable fit with the mean - spirited slapstick comedy and the script is astonishingly dumb . Dan Fogler delivers the worst comedy performance I 've ever seen . I HATED this offensively terrible movie . The fact that this got made in _ 2007 _ is frankly astonishing .

Emily Prentiss: Arsonists draw attention to themselves through the fires they set . The locations they choose are highly symbolic to them . While this unsub will never set an actual fire , he has the same psychosis as _ one _ who does .
Dr. Spencer Reid: Our unsub fits that model . His locations have been pillars of the community . The victims he picks are n't as important as the effect of killing them outside of your favorite restaurant or place of worship .
Derek Morgan: By picking locales with the highest visibility , he 's creating the highest level of fear in that neighborhood , which reinforces his feeling of power .
Detective Jake Moreland: Yeah , but arsonists do n't set out to hurt people . This guy clearly does .
Derek Morgan: That 's true . And this unsub definitely falls in the category of sociopath .
Emily Prentiss: His victims are there only to achieve his goal . He does n't have the ability to empathize with them . To him , they 're just ... tools for him to use , no different than a can of gasoline and a match .
David Rossi: But even how he kills tells us something . Slashing a throat is a messy , visual act . It 's designed to create attention , just like a fire .
Dr. Spencer Reid: Arsonists are often mission based . They need to make sure their first fire has burnt out before they set another one . They 're also highly disciplined and focused . If conditions are n't right to set a fire or , in this case , slash a throat , they 'll move on .
Aaron Hotchner: In addition to his need to kill , he has self - control . He has a short cooling off period because he 's enjoying what he 's doing . This in turn feeds his ego and keeps him covering his tracks .
David Rossi: This makes him even more dangerous . If he gets frustrated , encounters too many obstacles , or suffers a blow to his narcissistic ego , he could go on an all - out rampage .

Narrator: Anorexia nervosa is a condition of self starvation , which affects mostly women in their adolescence or young adulthood . Sufferers desperately want to be thin , and often transform their bodies to such an extent that menstruation ceases , and they revert to a pre - pubescent stage .
Woman #2: Do anorexics ever get hungry ?
Narrator: The term anorexia means lack of appetite , yet those who suffer from it are obsessed with food and its preparation , while they deny their own hunger and their body 's need for nutrients .
Woman #3: Do they really think they look attractive like that ?
Narrator: Anorectics often have a distorted perception of their actual body size . Although experts still can not account for this basic misrecognition , they do point out that the rigorous self discipline imposed by the anorectic is often the cause of an extreme exhilaration or high which accompanies and rewards her denial of food .

Now complete the following example-
input: Herself - Candidate:  Well , let 's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago . We had the worst financial crisis , the Great Recession , the worst since the 1930s . That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy , failed to invest in the middle class , took their eyes off of Wall Street , and created a perfect storm . In fact , Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis . He said , back in 2006 , "" Gee , I hope it does collapse , because then I can go in and buy some and make some money . "" Well , it did collapse .
Himself - Candidate: That 's called business , by the way .
Herself - Candidate: Nine million people - nine million people lost their jobs . Five million people lost their homes . And $ 13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out . Now , we have come back from that abyss . And it has not been easy . So we 're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy , but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place . Independent experts have looked at what I 've proposed and looked at what Donald 's proposed , and basically they 've said this , that if his tax plan , which would blow up the debt by over $ 5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle - class families compared to the wealthy , were to go into effect , we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession . They 've looked at my plans and they 've said , OK , if we can do this , and I intend to get it done , we will have 10 million more new jobs , because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy . Take clean energy . Some country is going to be the clean - energy superpower of the 21st century . Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese . I think it 's real .
Himself - Candidate: I did not . I did not . I do not say that .
Herself - Candidate: I think science is real .
Himself - Candidate: I do not say that .
Herself - Candidate: And I think it 's important that we grip this and deal with it , both at home and abroad . And here 's what we can do . We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels . We can have enough clean energy to power every home . We can build a new modern electric grid . That 's a lot of jobs ; that 's a lot of new economic activity . So I 've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do , and I am determined that we 're going to get the economy really moving again , building on the progress we 've made over the last eight years , but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place .
Himself - Moderator: Mr. Trump ?
Himself - Candidate: She talks about solar panels . We invested in a solar company , our country . That was a disaster . They lost plenty of money on that _ one _ . Now , look , I 'm a great believer in all forms of energy , but we 're putting a lot of people out of work . Our energy policies are a disaster . Our country is losing so much in terms of energy , in terms of paying off our debt . You ca n't do what you 're looking to do with $ 20 trillion in debt . The Obama administration , from the time they 've come in , is over 230 years ' worth of debt , and he 's topped it . He 's doubled it in a course of almost eight years , seven - and - a - half years , to be semi- exact . So I will tell you this . We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs . And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand , because they 're not doing it . And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving , they 're gone . And , Hillary , I 'd just ask you this . You 've been doing this for 30 years . Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now ? For 30 years , you 've been doing it , and now you 're just starting to think of solutions .
Herself - Candidate: Well , actually ...
Himself - Candidate: I will bring - excuse me . I will bring back jobs . You ca n't bring back jobs .
Herself - Candidate: Well , actually , I have thought about this quite a bit .
Himself - Candidate: Yeah , for 30 years .

Now complete the following example-
input: Wizard:  Kakarot was born to a low - class Saiyan warrior on the planet Vegeta . He narrowly escaped the extinction of his entire race when he was sent to Earth with a single , simple mission ...
Boomstick: Destroy everything ! Then he conveniently bumped his head and forgot about it all .
Wizard: Dubbed Goku by his adopted grandfather , his life revolves around combat . He cares little for anything else , unless food is involved .
Boomstick: At 12 years old , he was trained by Master Roshi in Kame - Sennin Ryu , which pushes a person to superhuman levels .
Wizard: Complementing his Saiyan biology , Goku 's superhuman strength , speed and senses skyrocketed . He developed numerous fighting techniques including the fast - moving After - Image and the Dragonthrow , his trademark grapple .
Boomstick: At fifteen , he was already so powerful that the only worthy teachers left were gods ... and a talking cat , but mostly GODS ! He was only a kid and already , his power level was already enormous !
Vegeta: It 's over _ 9000 _ !
Boomstick: Not yet ! Okay , now it is .
Wizard: FALSE ! In the Japanese manga , Goku 's power level at that time was 8000 . But it does n't even matter because power levels are absurd . The entire point of introducing them was to show how unreliable and meaningless they were . By relying on power levels , the villains constantly underestimated the heroes . Therefore , using them to judge Goku 's abilities is pointless . Besides , the Daizenshuu says that ...
Boomstick: Dai - what now ?
Wizard: The Official Dragonball Encyclopedia . It states power levels eventually become immeasurable , not because they are so high they ca n't be measured , but because the characters , and hopefully the audience , have realized just how futile these numbers are . We can not judge Goku by his power level , nor can we through power scaling , the theory that he can achieve the same feats as lesser Dragonball characters . Goku 's abilities are tailored to his personal training and experiences , not to mention anatomy .
Boomstick: However , Goku does have a knack for mimicking ki techniques .
Wizard: Ki is metaphysical , made up of things such as vigor , courage and being in one 's true mind .
Boomstick: It 's basically a kind of natural life force energy and is a fundamental component of Daoist medicine and martial arts . Oh , and uh , it 's NOT magic !
Wizard: Dragonball creates a very distinct difference between ki and magic . Ki is dependent on the physical ability of the user and magic - users like Babidi are clearly using something different . Goku harnesses and manipulates his ki energy ...
Boomstick: Into badass lasers and stuff , like ki blasts , energy barriers and the Destructo Disc , which he totally stole from Krillin . The Solar Flare blinds opponents and the Spirit Bomb puts energy from other things into a giant death ball ... that takes freaking forever to make .
Wizard: And energy taken from sentient beings must be voluntary . The Spirit Bomb is fueled by positive energy which is only effective against those filled with negative energy , AKA evil . In the Super Android 13 film , Goku actually absorbs the ki gathered from the Spirit Bomb , becoming one with it , transforming and manipulating the energy himself .
Boomstick: But his two best moves are the Dragon Fist , where he super - charges his punch with a golden ki dragon and the one and only Kamehameha : a giant focused beam which every kid in the world has always wanted to do . Do n't lie , you 've tried it .
Wizard: Goku also uses ki for telekinesis and high - speed flight . He can even sense the power and location of other ki sources and then teleport directly to them with Instant Transmission .
Boomstick: Which is light speed !
Goku: You dematerialize and travel as a mass of light .
Wizard: Again , FALSE ! This is another mistake in translation . According to the original manga , "" Instant Transmission is ... well ... instant . "" Its only flaw is that it requires concentrated focus . Also , he can read minds .
Boomstick: Wait , what ? Is there no limit to this ki thing ?
Wizard: There is . Goku draws from a finite pool of ki energy . So to increase his power , Goku perfected the art of Kaio - Ken . This amplifies Goku 's ki , multiplying his strength , speed , defense and so on .
Boomstick: Only one problem : it puts a giant strain on body and can even kill him .

Now complete the following example-
input: Wizard:  Dr. Eggman is the obese , yet strangely athletic , evil mastermind responsible for terrorizing the world of Sonic the Hedgehog , in his quest to rule a global empire . His engineering mastery has led to a massive army of unique robot warriors using the strangest fuel source , kidnapped animals .
Boomstick: He 's PETA 's worst nightmare !
Wizard: His army is based around speed and defense , including Moto Bugs , Caterkillers , Buzz Bombers , Egg Pawns and SWATbots .
Boomstick: But Eggman 's got way more than that ! His Egg Fleet is a huge armada of battleships , led by the massive Egg Carrier , which supports a huge front mounted laser cannon .
Wizard: The Eggman army is spearheaded by his deadliest robot warriors , the Badniks . The EggRobo is a smartbot crafted in Eggman 's own image and designed to carry out tasks Eggman himself would normally do .
Boomstick: What 's this guy 's deal with eggs ?
Wizard: On its own , Silver Sonic appears slow and bulky but it is powered by a Chaos Emerald , making it a much faster and more practical machine .
Boomstick: Then he made another robo - hog , Mecha Sonic , who focuses on firepower over speed !
Wizard: Mecha Sonic can even absorb Chaos energy to attain a short lived super form .
Boomstick: But Eggman wanted more than just Sonic bots . Mecha Knuckles can glide and vomit giant rockets ...
Wizard: And E-101 Beta remains one of Eggman 's most versatile machines .
Boomstick: He 's a flying robot with super speed , teleportation and a reflector shield ! He shoots homing missiles and kamehamehas and has one of my favorite defensive abilities ever , the backhand !
Wizard: The Shadow Androids are fast and durable and typically fight in groups of _ three _ . However , their design is so complex , they sometimes glitch in close combat . And speaking of glitches , despite being an absolute genius , Dr. Eggman appears to suffer from a peculiar personality disorder that sent him through several different "" phases "" .
Boomstick: Let 's just hope that Scratch and Grounder phase does n't show up today .
Wizard: But none of Eggman 's creations have ever been as deadly or as successful as his ultimate killing machine ...
Boomstick: Hyper Metal Sonic !
Wizard: Metal Sonic was specifically designed to be better than Sonic the Hedgehog in every way and was a complete success . Metal can move much faster than Sonic , easily reaching near mach 5 speeds . Metal 's abilities include Sonic 's spindash and homing attack , along with the impenetrable Black Shield .
Boomstick: He 's also got a chest laser , rocket powered flight and the maximum overdrive attack , where he overloads his circuits to create a glowing energy field that 'll burn through pretty much anything !
Wizard: And that 's not all . Somehow , Eggman managed to make Metal Sonic an ever evolving force . Metal has the uncanny ability to scan and copy data from others , flawlessly replicating their abilities .
Boomstick: Damn , Eggman sure stepped up his game !
Wizard: Absorbing enough power can transform Metal into a number of more impressive forms , all of which increase his abilities immeasurably .
Boomstick: The only downside to giving Metal Sonic a super brain is Eggman sometimes has trouble keeping him in line .
Wizard: But even with his metallic minions waging his war , Dr. Eggman is perfectly willing to step into the battlefield himself . He pilots the Eggmobile , a fast single man pod with twin mounted machine guns . The Eggmobile 's most vital function , however , is its universal compatibility to operate almost all of Eggman 's machines .
Boomstick: Like the humungous Death Egg Robot with its spiked rocket arms and lasers !
Wizard: Eggman is vicious and clever . He 's an expert at playing his opponents right into his hands . At the same time , though , he can be overly obsessive to the point of overlooking some important factors in an effort to concentrate on a single goal . But while this can be a perilous game for Eggman , it also makes him dangerously unpredictable .

We all feel the need for justice , and we all feel the need for vengeance , and telling the difference between the _ two _ can be difficult at times . We are all victims of the Cylons , and none of us can be impartial . I certainly ca n't . So today I am forming a commission on truth and reconciliation to hear our stories and record them for posterity . There will be no prosecutions . I am issuing a general pardon for every human being in this fleet . This will not be a popular move today , but I truly believe that is the only way for us to move forward in strength in the spirit of healing and reconciliation . I thank you for your continued patience and courage . Good day .

Now complete the following example-
input: Wizard:  Kakarot was born to a low - class Saiyan warrior on the planet Vegeta . He narrowly escaped the extinction of his entire race when he was sent to Earth with a single , simple mission ...
Boomstick: Destroy everything ! Then he conveniently bumped his head and forgot about it all .
Wizard: Dubbed Goku by his adopted grandfather , his life revolves around combat . He cares little for anything else , unless food is involved .
Boomstick: At 12 years old , he was trained by Master Roshi in Kame - Sennin Ryu , which pushes a person to superhuman levels .
Wizard: Complementing his Saiyan biology , Goku 's superhuman strength , speed and senses skyrocketed . He developed numerous fighting techniques including the fast - moving After - Image and the Dragonthrow , his trademark grapple .
Boomstick: At fifteen , he was already so powerful that the only worthy teachers left were gods ... and a talking cat , but mostly GODS ! He was only a kid and already , his power level was already enormous !
Vegeta: It 's over 9000 !
Boomstick: Not yet ! Okay , now it is .
Wizard: FALSE ! In the Japanese manga , Goku 's power level at that time was _ 8000 _ . But it does n't even matter because power levels are absurd . The entire point of introducing them was to show how unreliable and meaningless they were . By relying on power levels , the villains constantly underestimated the heroes . Therefore , using them to judge Goku 's abilities is pointless . Besides , the Daizenshuu says that ...
Boomstick: Dai - what now ?
Wizard: The Official Dragonball Encyclopedia . It states power levels eventually become immeasurable , not because they are so high they ca n't be measured , but because the characters , and hopefully the audience , have realized just how futile these numbers are . We can not judge Goku by his power level , nor can we through power scaling , the theory that he can achieve the same feats as lesser Dragonball characters . Goku 's abilities are tailored to his personal training and experiences , not to mention anatomy .
Boomstick: However , Goku does have a knack for mimicking ki techniques .
Wizard: Ki is metaphysical , made up of things such as vigor , courage and being in one 's true mind .
Boomstick: It 's basically a kind of natural life force energy and is a fundamental component of Daoist medicine and martial arts . Oh , and uh , it 's NOT magic !
Wizard: Dragonball creates a very distinct difference between ki and magic . Ki is dependent on the physical ability of the user and magic - users like Babidi are clearly using something different . Goku harnesses and manipulates his ki energy ...
Boomstick: Into badass lasers and stuff , like ki blasts , energy barriers and the Destructo Disc , which he totally stole from Krillin . The Solar Flare blinds opponents and the Spirit Bomb puts energy from other things into a giant death ball ... that takes freaking forever to make .
Wizard: And energy taken from sentient beings must be voluntary . The Spirit Bomb is fueled by positive energy which is only effective against those filled with negative energy , AKA evil . In the Super Android 13 film , Goku actually absorbs the ki gathered from the Spirit Bomb , becoming one with it , transforming and manipulating the energy himself .
Boomstick: But his two best moves are the Dragon Fist , where he super - charges his punch with a golden ki dragon and the one and only Kamehameha : a giant focused beam which every kid in the world has always wanted to do . Do n't lie , you 've tried it .
Wizard: Goku also uses ki for telekinesis and high - speed flight . He can even sense the power and location of other ki sources and then teleport directly to them with Instant Transmission .
Boomstick: Which is light speed !
Goku: You dematerialize and travel as a mass of light .
Wizard: Again , FALSE ! This is another mistake in translation . According to the original manga , "" Instant Transmission is ... well ... instant . "" Its only flaw is that it requires concentrated focus . Also , he can read minds .
Boomstick: Wait , what ? Is there no limit to this ki thing ?
Wizard: There is . Goku draws from a finite pool of ki energy . So to increase his power , Goku perfected the art of Kaio - Ken . This amplifies Goku 's ki , multiplying his strength , speed , defense and so on .
Boomstick: Only one problem : it puts a giant strain on body and can even kill him .

He made a comfortable living wagering whether he could swallow certain objects , billiard balls being a specialty . He 'd pick a ball , take it down his gullet to here , and regurgitate it back up . And one evening , I decided to challenge this man to a wager . _ Ten thousand _ in cash for him to do the trick with a billiard ball of my choosing . Now , he knew I 'd seen him do this a dozen times , so I can only surmise that he thought I was stupid . We laid down the cash and I handed him the cue ball . He swallowed it down . It lodged in his throat , and he choked to death on the spot . What I knew and he did n't was that the cue ball was one - sixteenth of an inch larger than the other balls . Just too large to swallow . Do you know what the moral of this tale is , Mr. Yale ?
