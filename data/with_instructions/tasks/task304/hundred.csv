Now complete the following example-
input: Erlich:  Yeah , we 're gon na win even if I have to go into the auditorium and personally jerk off every guy in the audience .
Jared: That 's a lot of jerking .
Gilfoyle: And we only have ten minutes to present . So ...
Richard: So , we 're fucked , are n't we ?
Dinesh: Yeah , even if he 's jerking _ two _ at a time , there are , what , 800 guys in that room ? So that 's 400 times whatever the mean jerk - time is .
Jared: The what ?
Dinesh: Mean jerk - time . I mean , it does n't matter , but , hypothetically , time is equal to 400 total jerks at a two - dick rate .
Gilfoyle: Unless Erlich jerks off four guys at a time , and then we can cut that in half .
Dinesh: How would he do four guys ... ? He 's got two hands , so that 's two dicks at a time , right ?
Gilfoyle: Look , you have two guys on either side with their dicks , tip to tip , so you 're going full - length . Four , see ?
Jared: Oh ... From the middle out . That does make sense .
Gilfoyle: Like two Shake Weights .
Dinesh: Yeah , so what we 're trying to do , hypothetically , is minimize which is 800 dudes , multiplied by mean - jerk time , divided by four dicks at a time . Of course , Erlich would have to pre - sort guys by height , so that their dicks lined up .
Gilfoyle: Not by height , technically . The measurement that we 're looking for , really , is dick to floor . Call that D2F.
Erlich: You know , if a guy 's dick was long enough , it would be able to reach up or down to another guy with a different D2F. The longer the dick , the greater the D2F bridge , but I would still be able to jerk it off in one smooth motion ... I 'd just have to jerk it on an angle .
Gilfoyle: So D2F sub-1 needs to equal D2F sub-2 , and D2F sub-3 needs to equal D2F sub-4 , where length L creates a complimentary shaft angle . Call that theta D. Now , the orgasm threshold ... as a function of Lamda sub ...
Jared: Guys , does girth - similarity affect Erlich 's ability to jerk different dicks simultaneously ?
Erlich: Shit . Yeah , I think it would .
Erlich: Of course , it does . Time to orgasm , or T2O , has to be the same for each matching pair of dicks otherwise I 'm wasting a lot of great strokes on a guy that 's already busted .
Gilfoyle: Unless you can hotswap dicks in and out . So on a downstroke , you get a new one in . So when you stroke up you 're not wasting any energy .
Dinesh: Even so . I think this is the most reliable metric for stamina .
Erlich: Let
Erlich: me ask you something . How fast do you think you could jack off every guy in this room ? 'Cause I know how long it would take me . And I can prove it .

input: President John Sheridan:  The universe speaks in many languages but only one voice . The langage is not Narn or human or Centauri or Gaim or Minbari . It speaks in the language of hope .
G'Kar: It speaks in the language of trust . It speaks in the language of strength and the language of compassion . It is the language of the heart and the language of the soul . But always it is the same voice . It is the voice of our ancestors speaking through us . And the voice of our inheritors waiting to be born . It is the small , still voice that says : "" We are one . "" No matter the blood , no matter the skin , no matter the world , no matter the star : we are one . No matter the pain , no matter the darkness , no matter the loss , no matter the fear : we are one . Here gathered together in common cause we agree to recognize this singular truth and this singular rule : that we must be kind to one another .
President John Sheridan: Because each voice enriches us and ennobles us , and each voice lost , diminishes us . We are the voice of the universe , the soul of creation , the fire that will light the way to a better future . We are one .
G'Kar: We are _ one _ .
