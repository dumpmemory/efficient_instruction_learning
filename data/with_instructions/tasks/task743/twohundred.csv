The Commission shall calculate the amount to be deducted in respect of import charges other than customs duties, in so far as prices notified to the Commission by Member States include these charges, so as to avoid any difficulties arising from the effect of these charges on entry prices which may vary according to origin. Accordingly, an average mean corresponding to the arithmetical mean between the lowest and the highest charges shall be taken into account for the calculation.The detailed rules for applying this paragraph shall be determined, as may be necessary, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 33 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72.3.

Member States shall in particular abolish the following restrictions:    (a) those which prevent beneficiaries from establishing themselves or providing services in the host Member States under the same conditions and with the same rights as their nationals;(b) those existing by reason of administrative practices which result in treatment being applied to beneficiaries that is discriminatory by comparison with that applied to nationals.2. The restrictions to be abolished shall include in particular those arising out of provisions which prevent or limit establishment of beneficiaries or provision of services by the latter by the following means:    (a) in Belgium:the obligation to hold a carte professionnelle (Article 1, Law of 19 February 1965);(b) in France:      - the obligation to hold a carte d identité d étranger commerçant (Décret-loi of 12 November 1938, Décret of 2 February 1939, Law of 8 October 1940, Law of 10 April 1954, Décret No 59-852 of 9 July 1959);- exclusion from the right to renew commercial leases (Article 38 of Décret of 30 September 1953);(c) in Luxembourg:the limited period of validity of authorizations granted to foreign nationals (Article 21 of the Law of 2 June 1962). 1. Member States shall ensure that beneficiaries have the right to join professional or trade organizations under the same conditions and with the same rights and obligations as their own nationals.2.

Where a host Member State requires of its own nationals wishing to take up any activity referred to in Article 2 proof of good repute and proof that they have not previously been declared bankrupt, or proof of either one of these, that State shall accept as sufficient evidence, in respect of nationals of other Member States, the production of an extract from the 'judicial record' or, failing this, of an equivalent document issued by a competent judicial or administrative authority in the Member State of origin or the Member State whence the foreign national comes showing that these requirements have been met.2. Where a host Member State imposes on its own nationals wishing to take up one of the activities referred to in Article 2, certain requirements as to good repute, and proof that such requirements are satisfied cannot be obtained from the document referred to in paragraph 1, that State shall accept as sufficient evidence in respect of nationals of other Member States a certificate issued by a competent judicial or administrative authority in the country of origin or in the country whence the foreign national comes, indicating that the requirements in question have been met. Such certificate shall relate to the specific facts regarded as relevant by the host country.3. Where the country of origin or the country whence the foreign national comes does not issue the document referred to in paragraph 1 or the certificate referred to in paragraph 2 furnishing proof of good repute or proof of no previous bankruptcy, such proof may be replaced by a declaration on oath - or, in States where there is no provision for declaration on oath, by a solemn declaration - made by the person concerned before a competent judicial or administrative authority, or where appropriate a notary, in the country whence that person comes ; such authority or notary will issue a certificate attesting the authenticity of the declaration on oath or solemn declaration. The declaration in respect of no previous bankruptcy may also be made before a competent professional or trade body in the said country.4. Documents issued in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 may not be produced more than three months after their date of issue.5. Member States shall, within the time limit laid down in Article 8, designate the authorities and bodies competent to issue the documents referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 and shall forthwith inform the other Member States and the Commission thereof.6. Where in the host Member State proof of financial standing is required, that State shall regard certificates issued by banks in the Member State of origin or in the country whence the foreign national comes as equivalent to certificates issued in its own territory.

For the purposes of this Directive, 'the occupation of road haulage operator' means the activity of any natural person or any undertaking transporting goods for hire or reward by means of either a self-contained motor vehicle or a combination of coupled vehicles.  (1)OJ No C 72, 19.7.1968, p. 53. (2)OJ No C 49, 17.5.1968, p. 2.For the purposes of this Directive, 'undertaking' means any association or group of persons with or without legal personality, whether profit-making or not, or any official body whether having its own legal personality or being dependent upon an authority having such personality. 1. This Directive shall not apply to natural persons or undertakings engaging in the occupation of road haulage operator by means of vehicles the permissible payload of which does not exceed 3.5 metric tons or the permissible total laden weight of which does not exceed six metric tons. Member States may, however, lower the said limits for all or some categories of transport operations.2. Member States may, after consulting the Commission, exempt from the application of all or some of the provisions of this Directive natural persons or undertakings engaged exclusively in national transport operations having only a minor impact on the transport market because of:    - the nature of the goods carried, or- the short distance involved. 1. Natural persons or undertakings wishing to engage in the occupation of road haulage operator shall:    (a) be of good repute;(b) be of appropriate financial standing;(c) satisfy the condition as to professional competence.Where the applicant is a natural person and does not satisfy provision (c), the competent authorities may nevertheless permit him to engage in the occupation of road haulage operator provided that he designates to the said authorities another person, satisfying provisions (a) and (c) above, who shall continuously and effectively manage the transport operations of the undertaking.Where the applicant is an undertaking, provisions (a) and (c) above must be satisfied by one of the natural persons who will continuously and effectively manage the transport operations of the undertaking. Member States may also require that other persons in the undertaking satisfy provision (a) above.2. Pending coordination at a later date, each Member State shall determine the provisions relating to good repute which must be satisfied by the applicant and, where appropriate, by the natural persons referred to in paragraph 1.3. Appropriate financial standing shall consist in having available sufficient resources to ensure the launching and proper administration of the undertaking. Pending coordination at a later date, each Member State shall determine what provisions and what methods of furnishing proof may be adopted for this purpose.4. The condition as to professional competence shall consist in the possession of skills in the subjects listed in the Annex and recognized by the authority or body designated for that purpose by each Member State. The necessary knowledge shall be acquired by attending courses, by practical experience in a transport undertaking or by a combination of both. Member States may exempt from the application of these provisions the holders of certain advanced diplomas or technical diplomas implying sound knowledge of the subjects listed in the Annex.The production of a certificate issued by the authority or body referred to in the preceding subparagraph shall constitute proof of professional competence. 1.

However, the competent authorities in the Member States may, by way of exception and in certain special cases, definitively authorize a person not fulfilling the condition of professional competence referred to in Article 3 (1) (c) to operate the transport undertaking provided that such person possesses at least three years practical experience in the day-to-day management of the undertaking. 1. Natural persons and undertakings furnishing proof that, before 1 January 1978, they were authorized under national regulations in a Member State to engage in the occupation of road haulage operator in national and/or international road transport operations shall be exempt from the requirement to furnish proof that they satisfy the provisions laid down in Article 3.2.

Decisions taken by the competent authorities of the Member States pursuant to the measures adopted on the basis of this Directive and entailing the rejection of an application for admission to the occupation of road haulage operator shall state the grounds on which they are based.2. Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities withdraw the authorization to pursue the occupation of haulage operator if they establish that the provisions of Article 3 (1) (a), (b) or (c) are no longer satisfied. In this case, however, they shall allow sufficient time for a substitute to be appointed.3. With regard to the decisions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, Member States shall ensure that the natural persons or undertakings covered by this Directive are able to defend their interests by appropriate means. 1.

Member States may, after consulting the Commission, exempt from the application of all or some of the provisions of this Directive natural persons or undertakings engaged exclusively in road passenger transport services for non-commercial purposes or having a main occupation other than that of road passenger transport operator, in so far as their transport operations have only a minor impact on the transport market. 1. Natural persons or undertakings wishing to engage in the occupation of road passenger transport operator shall:    (a) be of good repute;(b) be of appropriate financial standing;(c) satisfy the condition as to professional competence.Where the applicant is a natural person and does not satisfy provision (c), the competent authorities may  (1)OJ No C 17, 12.2.1969, p. 6.

Member States may also require that other persons in the undertaking satisfy provision (a) above.2. Pending coordination at a later date, each Member State shall determine the provisions relating to good repute which must be satisfied by the applicant and, where appropriate, the natural persons referred to in paragraph 1.3. Appropriate financial standing shall consist in having available sufficient financial resources to ensure the launching and proper administration of the undertaking. Pending coordination at a later date, each Member State shall determine what provisions and what methods of furnishing proof may be adopted for this purpose.4. The condition as to professional competence shall consist in the possession of skills in the subjects listed in the Annex and recognized by the authority or body designated for that purpose by each Member State. The necessary knowledge shall be acquired by attending courses, by practical experience in a transport undertaking or by a combination of both. The Member States may exempt from the application of these provisions the holders of certain advanced diplomas or technical diplomas implying sound knowledge of the subjects listed in the Annex.The production of a certificate issued by the authority or body referred to in the preceding subparagraph shall constitute proof of professional competence. 1.

Decisions taken by the competent authorities of Member States pursuant to the measures adopted on the basis of this Directive and entailing the rejection of an application for admission to the occupation of road passenger transport operator shall state the grounds on which they are based.2. Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities withdraw the authorization to pursue the occupation of passenger transport operator if they establish that the provisions of Article 2 (1) (a), (b) or (c) are no longer satisfied. In this case, however, they shall allow sufficient time for a substitute to be appointed.3. With regard to the decisions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, Member States shall ensure that the natural persons or undertakings covered by this Directive are able to defend their interests by appropriate means. 1.

Each Member State shall recognize the right to remain permanently in its territory of:    (a) any person who, at the time of termination of his activity, has reached the age laid down by the law of that State for entitlement to an old-age pension and who has pursued his activity in that State for at least the previous twelve months and has resided there continuously for more than three years.Where the law of that Member State does not grant the right to an old-age pension to certain categories of self-employed workers, the age requirement shall be considered as satisfied when the beneficiary reaches 65 years of age;(b) any person who, having resided continuously in the territory of that State for more than two years, ceases to pursue his activity there as a result of permanent incapacity to work.If such incapacity is the result of an accident at work or an occupational illness entitling him to a pension which is payable in whole or in part by an institution of that State no condition shall be imposed as to length of residence;(c) any person who, after three years' continuous activity and residence in the territory of that State, pursues his activity in the territory of another Member State, while retaining his residence in the territory of the first State, to which he returns, as a rule, each day or at least once a week.Periods of activity so completed in the territory of the other Member State shall, for the purposes of entitlement to the rights referred to in (a) and (b), be considered as having been completed in the territory of the State of residence.2. The conditions as to length of residence and activity laid down in paragraph 1 (a) and the condition as to length of residence laid down in paragraph 1 (b) shall not apply if the spouse of the self-employed person is a national of the Member State concerned or has lost the nationality of that State by marriage to that person. 1. Each Member State shall recognize the right of the members of the self-employed person's family referred to in Article 1 who are residing with him in the territory of that State to remain there permanently, if the person concerned has acquired the right to remain in the territory of that State in accordance with Article 2. This provision shall continue to apply even after the death of the person concerned.2. If, however, the self-employed person dies during his working life and before having acquired the right to remain in the territory of the State concerned, that State shall recognize the right of the members of his family to remain there permanently on condition that:    - the person concerned, on the date of his decease, had resided continuously in its territory for at least two years ; or- his death resulted from an accident at work or an occupational illness ; or- the surviving spouse is a national of that State or lost such nationality by marriage to the person concerned. 1. Continuity of residence as provided for in Articles 2 (1) and 3 (2) may be attested by any means of proof in use in the country of residence. It may not be affected by temporary absences not exceeding a total of three months per year, nor by longer absences due to compliance with the obligations of military service.2. Periods of inactivity due to circumstances outside the control of the person concerned or of inactivity owing to illness or accident must be considered as periods of activity within the meaning of Article 2 (1). 1. Member States shall allow the person entitled to the right to remain to exercise such right within two years from the time of becoming entitled thereto pursuant to Article 2 (1) (a) and (b) and Article 3. During this period the beneficiary must be able to leave the territory of the Member State without adversely affecting such right.2. Member States shall not require the person concerned to comply with any particular formality in order to exercise the right to remain. 1. Member States shall recognize the right of persons having the right to remain in their territory to a residence permit, which must:    (a) be issued and renewed free of charge or on payment of a sum not exceeding the dues and taxes payable by nationals for the issue or renewal of identity cards;(b) by valid throughout the territory of the Member State issuing it;(c) be valid for five years and renewable automatically.2. Periods of non-residence not exceeding six consecutive months and longer absences due to compliance with the obligations of military service may not affect the validity of a residence permit. Member States shall apply to persons having the right to remain in their territory the right of equality of treatment recognized by the Council Directives on the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment pursuant to Title III of the General Programme which provides for such abolition. 1. This Directive shall not affect any provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action of any Member State which would be more favourable to nationals of other Member States.2. Member States shall facilitate re-admission to their territories of self-employed persons who left those territories after having resided there permanently for a long period while pursuing an activity there and who wish to return when they have reached retirement age as defined in Article 2 (1) (a) or are permanently incapacitated for work. Member States may not derogate from the provisions of this Directive save on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. 01. Member States shall, within twelve months of notification of this Directive, bring into force the  measures necessary to comply with its provisions and shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.2.

This obligation shall not apply to power stations fired by manufactured gases, industrial waste and other fuel derived from waste, nor to private industrial generators with a total capacity of less than 100 MWe.Governments of Member States may, depending on their domestic situation, fix a threshold lower than that referred to above.3. When the obligation to maintain stocks is such to create difficulties of a particularly serious nature for any power station, the competent authority in the Member State concerned may exempt it in full or in part from this obligation. The Member State shall inform the Commission of its decision immediately, stating the reasons for it.4. Stocks shall be held on the premises of the power station or at a place directly linked thereto. Stocks may be held at a place further removed, provided that they can be conveyed to the power station at all times.In the case of power stations fired by natural gas, lignite or peat, the deposit which supplies the station may be considered as station stock, provided there is a guarantee that sufficient quantities can be delivered to ensure the continuation of electricity supplies for the period laid down in Article 1, even in the event of difficulties in maintaining fuel supplies to thermal power stations. This shall also apply to power stations fired by coal, provided they are located near the mines which supply them.5. The quantities of fuel to be held at each thermal power station shall be determined by the electricity producers in the light of the possibilities offered by the transmission and interconnection network.Electricity producers may form themselves into groups in order to apportion fuel stocks among their power stations, provided they can guarantee the continuation of electricity supplies for the period laid down in Article 1. 1. Each electricity producer shall furnish the competent authority in the Member State concerned with a statement, drawn up on 1 January, 1 April, 1 July and 1 October each year at least, of the stocks held at its thermal power stations specifying the quantities necessary to ensure the continuation of electricity supplies for the period laid down in Article 1. These statements shall be forwarded within 30 days of each of the abovementioned dates. Member States shall take the necessary steps to check the accuracy of these statements.2. Member States shall submit to the Commission the statement of the stocks held on 1 April and 1 October of each year at these power stations, specifying the quantities necessary to ensure the continuation of electricity supplies for the period laid down in Article 1. These statements must be forwarded not later than 1 June and 1 December of each year.3. At the request of the Commission, the statements referred to in paragraph 2 shall be made for periods and on dates other than those laid down in that paragraph. If Community thermal power stations experience fuel supply difficulties, electricity producers may, after authorization by the competent authority of the Member State concerned, draw on the minimum stocks built up pursuant to the rules laid down in Article 1.Member States shall inform the Commission of all drawings on stocks and shall make known, as soon as possible:    - the quantities drawn from the stocks and the date on which the stocks fall below the mandatory minimum;- the urgent reasons justifying such drawings;- any measures taken to build up these stocks again;- if possible, probable changes in stock levels during the period in which they remain below the mandatory minimum. Stocks conforming to the provisions of this Directive shall be built up as soon as possible after the date of notification of this Directive and at the latest by 1 January 1978. Member States shall inform the Commission of the measures taken to this end. Any information forwarded pursuant to this Directive shall be confidential. This provision shall not hinder the publication of general information or summaries  which do not include specific details concerning undertakings. This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

Member States shall adopt the measures defined in this Directive in respect of establishment or provision of services in their territories by natural persons and companies or firms covered by Title I of the General Programmes (hereinafter called 'beneficiaries') wishing to pursue the activities referred to in Article 2.2. This Directive shall also apply to nationals of Member States who, as provided in Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68, wish to pursue as paid employees activities referred to in Article 2. This Directive shall apply to the following itinerant activities:    (a) the buying and selling of goods:      - by itinerant tradesmen, hawkers or pedlars (ex ISIC Group 612);- in covered markets other than from permanently fixed installations and in open-air markets;(b) activities covered by transitional measures already adopted that expressly exclude or do not mention the pursuit of such activities on an itinerant basis. 1. Where a host Member State requires of its own nationals wishing to take up any activity referred to in Article 2 proof of good repute and proof that they have not previously been declared bankrupt, or proof of either one of these, that State shall accept as sufficient evidence, in respect of nationals of other Member States, the production of an extract from the 'judicial record' or, failing this, of an equivalent document issued by a competent judicial or administrative authority in the Member State of origin or the Member State whence the foreign national comes showing that these requirements have been met.2. Where a host Member State imposes on its own nationals wishing to take up one of the activities referred to in Article 2, certain requirements as to good repute, and proof that such requirements are satisfied cannot be obtained from the document referred to in paragraph 1, that State shall accept as sufficient evidence in respect of nationals of other Member States, a certificate issued by a competent judicial or administrative authority in the country of origin or in the country whence the foreign national comes, showing that the requirements in question have been met. Such certificate shall relate to the specific facts regarded as relevant by the host country.3. Where the country of origin or the country whence the foreign national comes does not issue the document referred to in paragraph 1 or the certificate referred to in paragraph 2 furnishing proof of good repute or proof of no previous bankruptcy, such proof may be replaced by a declaration on oath - or, in a State where there is no provision for declaration on oath, by a solemn declaration - made by the person concerned before a competent judicial or administrative authority, or where appropriate, a notary, in the country of origin or the country whence that person comes ; such authority or notary will issue a certificate attesting the authenticity of the declaration on oath or solemn declaration. The declaration in respect of no previous bankruptcy may also be made before a competent professional or trade body in the said country.  (1)OJ No L 257, 19.10.1968, p. 2.4. Documents issued in accordance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 may not be produced more than three months after their date of issue.5.

Where in the host Member State proof of financial standing is required, that State shall regard certificates issued by banks in the Member State of origin or in the country whence the foreign national comes as equivalent to certificates issued in its own territory. Member States in which the taking up or pursuit of any activity referred to in Article 2 is subject to possession of certain qualifications shall ensure that any beneficiary who applies therefor be provided, before he establishes himself or before he begins to pursue any activity on a temporary basis, with information as to the rules governing the occupation which he proposes to pursue. 1. Where in a Member State the taking up or pursuit of any activity referred to in Article 2 is subject to possession of general, commercial, or professional knowledge and ability, that Member State shall, subject to Article 6, accept as sufficient evidence of such knowledge and ability the fact that the activity in question has been pursued in another Member State for any of the following periods:    (a) three consecutive years either in an independent capacity or in a managerial capacity ; or(b) two consecutive years in an independent capacity or in a managerial capacity, where the beneficiary proves that for the activity in question he has received previous training, attested by a certificate recognized by the State or regarded by the competent professional or trade body as fully satisfying its requirements ; or(c) two consecutive years in an independent capacity or in a managerial capacity, where the beneficiary proves that he has pursued the activity in question for at least three years in an non-independent capacity ; or(d) three consecutive years in a non-independent capacity, where the beneficiary proves that for the activity in question he has received previous training, attested by a certificate recognized by the State or regarded by a competent professional or trade body as fully satisfying its requirements.The host Member State may require of nationals of other Member States, in so far as it so requires of its own nationals, that the activity in question should have been pursued, and vocational training received, in the same branch of trade (or in a related branch) as that in which the beneficiary wishes to establish himself in the host Member State.2. In the cases referred to in paragraph 1 (a) and (c), pursuit of the activity in question shall not have ceased more than 10 years before the date on which the application provided for in Article 8 is made. However, where a shorter period is laid down in a Member State for its own nationals, that period may also be applied in respect of beneficiaries. 1. Notwithstanding Article 5, where in a Member State any activity referred to in Article 2 is regarded as being of an industrial or small craft nature and where the taking up or pursuit of such activity is subject to possession of general, commercial or professional knowledge and ability, that Member State shall accept as sufficient evidence of such knowledge and ability the fact that the activity in question has been pursued in another Member State for any of the following periods:    (a) six consecutive years either in an independent capacity or in a managerial capacity ; or(b) three consecutive years either in an independent capacity or in a managerial capacity, where the beneficiary proves that for the activity in question he has received at least three years  previous training, attested by a certificate recognized by the State or regarded by the competent professional or trade body as fully satisfying its requirements ; or(c) three consecutive years in an independent capacity, where the beneficiary proves that the has pursued the activity in question for at least five years in a non-independent capacity ; or(d) five consecutive years in a managerial capacity, not less than three years of which were spent in technical posts with responsibility for one or more departments of the undertaking, where the beneficiary proves that for the activity in question he has received at least three years   previous training, attested by a certificate recognized by the State or regarded by the competent professional or trade body as fully satisfying its requirements.2. In the cases referred to in paragraph 1 (a) and (c), pursuit of the activity shall not have ceased more than 10 years before the date when the application provided for in Article 8 is made. However, where a shorter period is laid down in a Member State for its own nationals that period may also be applied in respect of beneficiaries. A person shall be regarded as having pursued an activity in a managerial capacity within the meaning of Articles 5 and 6 if he has pursued such an activity in an industrial or commercial undertaking in the occupational field in question:    (a) as manager of an undertaking or manager of a branch of an undertaking ; or(b) as deputy to the proprietor or to the manager of an undertaking, where such post involves responsibility equivalent to that of the proprietor or manager represented ; or(c) in a managerial post with duties of a commercial nature and with responsibility for at least one department of the undertaking. Proof that the conditions laid down in Articles 5 and 6 are satisfied shall be established by a certificate issued by a competent authority or body in the Member State of origin or Member State whence the person concerned comes, which the latter shall submit in support of his application for authorization to pursue the activity or activities in question in the host Member State. For the purpose of applying Article 6 and in so far as is necessary:    1. Member States in which the taking up or pursuit of any activity referred to in Article 2 is subject to possession of general, commercial or professional knowledge and ability shall, with the assistance of the Commission, inform the other Member States of the main characteristics of that occupation;2. the competent authority designated for this purpose by the Member State of origin or the State whence the beneficiary comes shall certify what professional or trade activities were actually pursued by the beneficiary and the duration of those activities. Certificates shall be drawn up having regard to the official description of the occupation in question supplied by the Member State in which the beneficiary wishes to pursue such occupation, whether permanently or temporarily;3. the host Member State shall grant authorization to pursue the activity in question on application by the person concerned, provided that the activity certified conforms to the main features of the description of the occupation communicated pursuant to point 1 and provided that any other requirements laid down by the rules of that State are satisfied. 0Member States shall, within the time limit laid down in Article 12, designate the authorities and bodies competent to issue the certificates referred to in Articles 8 and 9 and shall forthwith inform the other Member States and the Commission thereof. 1The transitional provisions laid down in this Directive shall remain applicable until the entry into force of provisions relating to the coordination of national rules concerning the taking up and pursuit of the activities in question. 2Member States shall bring into force the measures necessary to comply with this Directive within 12 months of its notification and shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof. 3Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive. 4This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
