input: My boyfriend (well just call him M) and I are creators on Instagram (he is also on TikTok). I'm a digital and traditional artist and in one of my classes we create t shirts and things (socks, lanyards, water bottles, stickers, you name it). I'm a big fan of putting my art on t shirts so I can sell them.

M wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

input: Im making a throwaway account because i don't want anyone to know this and this has had a really big emotional toll on me so please be respectful in the comments. I want to know who's in the wrong but please be respectful when doing so. So i've been dating my girlfriend for a few months now and i really felt like she was the one for me. I thought we were getting married. I remember when we were dating she used to talk about how wedgies were funny and she would give me them a lot. I did it to her a couple times back and i felt it was weird she seemed to enjoy them. She would even ask me to give her them too which was even weirder. Wedgies are supposed to be a prank, they hurt and are embarrassing, definitely not enjoyable to receive one. She was giving me wedgies every time we hung out and it was getting really really annoying and i'd tell her to stop. She'd calm for a bit but then revert to it. Eventually we're hanging out and she leaves to go the bathroom. I go on her computer to look up flight tickets or something and i see a closed tab of a youtube compilation of guys getting wedgies. There was also one of guys getting wedgies on google images and thats when i realized that wedgies are some sort of weird fetish. This whole time i felt i've been violated. SHe'd only did it a couple times in public in front of my close friends or hers so it wasn't that big of a deal but now knowing she gets sexual pleasure out of it I feel like she also cheated on me when she gave my guy friends wedgies too. I told her i figured out what is going on and that her wedgie fetish is disgusting and degerneate and i can't be with someone who gets turned on by that. She starts crying and she's on her knees begging me to not leave her and give her another chance and to find a way to work things out. I leave and everyday i get missed calls and texts which I've been ignoring. I'm considering maybe giving her a second chance but idk. AITA here? all my friends think so and her friends have been harassing me nonstop, i had to block them all on social media. Should i give me gf another chance or did she violate me? I really feel if the gender roles were swapped I would be considered the asshole

Now complete the following example-
input: So I often drink a couple of beers after work to wind down (not every day, but it’s a normal thing for me). Tonight I was watching tv and my son asked if he could try some. I held the bottle and let him have a small sip. I thought he might spit it out but he just kind of made a small face and that was it. 

My wife was right there when it happened and she gets this horrified look on her face. I say “he just had a small sip”. She said nothing and ends up putting our son down to bed and proceeds to let me have it in a the weird hushed/scream voice she uses when she’s upset but wants to be quiet. 

She said she thought for sure I would tell him no when he asked and she can’t believe I gave him alcohol. I explained why I didn’t think it was a big deal but she’s still pretty angry. I guess I’ve always been more easygoing when it comes to parenting...

Anyway I’m just wondering if what I did sounds so terrible to the average person. I mean, it’s not like I let him chug the whole bottle! I figured he was just curious about the taste, and now he knows. Literally one sip and that was it. (Although if you ask my wife she’ll say he had a “gulp” of it). 

So was I the asshole in this situation? (Using a throwaway because I post in other parenting subs on my main, and I don’t want any judginess spilling over).

Now complete the following example-
input: So my friend and I have been super close for like five years now, but living together for only a year.  In that one year though I've grown to not like his behavior.

We run with a very tight knit group that all know who the type of person he is, and when you don't see him as much, is a great guy.  But he's had a history of changing how he acts based on friends we have hanging around us.  When he's around those people he begins to insult me and my other roommate, who's also a close friend of ours.

We've told him before how we don't appreciate him insulting us, especially when he doesn't do that to his other friends.  His response was just that he didn't mean it to be rude, he just thought since we were close he could.  Even though we don't ""joke"" back.

But there was a part where he crossed a line for me.

I work with kids, so naturally he thinks it's funny to call me a pedophile.  Not only to other friends, one who also works with me, but his online friends (he games)  that I've never met.  I tell him to not do that, and he persists.

I'm also very close to someone with a kid.  And one night I was playing with the child, in front of the friend.  The child wanted to play foot doctor and asked me to take off my shoe and sock.  I thought I was cute so I recorded the interaction and put it on a social media story.

He then puts me in a group chat with a friend of ours, and then goes on ask me why I have videos of little girls playing with my feet.  And saying that he thought it was creepy.  He knows that girl and my relation to the mother and that's where I drew the line.

I told him to go fuck himself and have yet to talk to him again.  I've let other people know that I'm currently not on good terms with him and they have essentially said ""that's just how he jokes"" and made me out to be the bad guy for being stuck up and sensitive about it.

I don't think it's personally funny, especially when it's the child of a very good friend of mine.

AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: My daughter is 9 and just started going to a new school in January because we moved. It is a public school in an urban city which is quite multicultural. She is half-Chinese and half-white. Although she is part Chinese, not many people can notice. Some have thought that she is Italian or Greek or even Irish for some reason.

Anyways, a month and a bit ago, my daughter came home a bit sad. I asked her what was wrong and she told me that in school, everyone shared what they did for the weekend. My daughter said that her family is Chinese so they celebrated Chinese New Year. The teacher (who is white) apparently told her “But you’re not Chinese. You shouldn’t lie.” My daughter said she felt embarassed in front of the whole class.

I was amused but also angry. I phoned her teacher and VERY CASUALLY told her that my daughter felt hurt by her being dismissive of her heritage. Her teacher was strangely defensive and asked me if I was accusing her of something. I said no and just that she should try being more open minded. 

A few days after this incident, my daughter said she felt like the teacher was treating her unfairly, namely refusing to let her go to the water fountain during class, giving her a “time out” for not lining up in time for recess, putting her on the spot to answer a question and berating her when she had the wrong answer. This time both my husband and I booked an appt to talk with the teacher, who was quite dismissive of us and very unhelpful. 

At this point it was affecting my daughter’s enjoyment of school. She would cry at night and beg me to send her back to her old school. Finally I had a talk with the principal, who told me that other parents have been accusing the teacher of racism in the past and said they’re trying to work with her. In the meantime my daughter was transferred to another class which worked out great.

Flash forward to last week when I was picking up my daughter from school. Her old teacher approached me and we made a bit of small talk, then she said casually, “Well Im not going to return to teach next year so I guess I can thank you.”

I was super taken aback. I told her I did NOT mean for her to lose her job. She then walked away from me.

I also learned from another parent that she was 4 kids and is a single mom. This made me extremely sad and I can’t help but feel guilty for playing a role in having her fired. My husband told me she was probably gonna get fired anyways and said I shouldn’t feel bad.

AITA though? I feel so so horrible knowing that she cannot support her 4 kids anymore partially because of my complaint against her.

input: I really can’t tell if I was being too insensitive or not. 

A few friends and I were invited to play some touch football at the beach one day with some random people we met who were throwing around a football. After a while we were getting out of breath from all the activity and one of the guys made a joke saying something like “I’m going to end up tearing my other ACL.”

He talked a bit about it a bit later on telling us how he tore his ACL in high school and how it sucked.

After a while of playing, we all getting very tired and almost falling over. I ended up tripping myself out of fatigue when running for the ball and said something along the lines of “I better watch out or I’ll end up tearing my ACL.”

After saying that, the guy who tore his ACL started to criticize me about how tearing an ACL is a serious thing and shouldn’t be joked about.

I understand tearing an ACL is serious but this guy seemed perfectly fine playing the game and I thought it wasn’t too serious of a thing for him since he was making a joke about it earlier. AITA?

I asked him to get out, and my memory is not perfect but it led to him punching me in the face. I got angry and punched him in the shoulder. He looked aghast and told me that I had to move out by tomorrow because he didn't want to son like me. I'm going to talk to him tomorrow and hope that we can come to some sort of compromise.

Now complete the following example-
input: So I just recently found this subreddit and figured I would share my story from a couple of years ago.

I was in the cinema with some friends watching Super Bowl. Patriots vs Falcons. We had booked our seats several weeks prior in order to get the best possible seats just below the walking area, so we could just jump down instead of having to go all the way around and inconvinience people.

When we got there some guy had taken the very center seat and refused to move. So after several minutes of confrontations and threatening with getting the usher he finally moved a couple of seats to the side. But before he could move he ""accidentally"" spilled cola on my seat. Now I spent the first quarter of the game sitting on a soaking wet seat. This was so fucking frustrating and I had a hard time enjoying myself for what is a fun night of tradition with my friends.

Patriots were really far behind and this guy was an annoyance constantly making hand signatures and grunting whenever the refs would make ""a wrong call"". We are roughly down to 5 minutes of the first half and Patriots are behind with 20-25 points and this guy goes out to get some drinks before the halftime show. As he goes away I prepare my revenge.

He had locked his seat so he could jump down instead of going around. I however had noticed this and decided to unlock his seat so it would go back and forwards whenever you move in the seat. He comes back with a very big cola and as he steps into his seat he gets surprised about it not being locked, he trips and spills his drink all over himself while me, my friends and a good chunk of the cinema burst out laughing.

He ends up leaving, presumably to go get cleaned up, however he never returned, which I figure was due to his team losing badly.

Well for people who remember Patriots overcame a 25 points deficit and managed to win in the biggest Super Bowl comeback in history and this guy missed it all because he had to spill drinks on a seat he didn't even pay for in the first place. 

I ended up feeling like an asshole but at the same time it felt so good after having to sit on a soaking seat for almost 5 hours.

Anyway, I'm in a local LGBTQ+ WhatsApp group and we talk about many different issues, so I tried to talk about my concerns.

I immediately get blasted by a guy who tells me that I ""should have more respect because dysphoria and similar issues can't be self-diagnosed"" and that he ""got diagnosed with them by professionals"".

That made me feel kinda bad, because I was just trying to open up about my personal experience with a group I thought I could trust and that could relate with me, nothing else.

input: we're both 24 and been together for 2 years, and I just got promoted to a very stressful role in software sales in July and the amount of stress of having to hit targets/quotas per quarter is insane and it was giving me crazy anxiety and making me really sad. I've been feeling this way since I got into the software sales industry out of college because of having to hit quotas but now with the promotion its even more stress. But the thing is that I hold it all in from my GF, family and friends and I sometimes just cry in the shower. I don't want to seem weak to my GF and complain about my job to my parents so I just deal with it, but its been fucking me up mentally so badly. 

I started seeing a therapist in December and its been helping a good amount, I've made some good progress and she has experience working with people dealing with high amounts of work stress. I get reminded of my appts, which are once a week for 1 hour by text message 24 hours in advance and on Sunday mid day my GF was over and I got the text reminder about my appt on monday at 4. My GF saw this and googled the name of the therapist and found everything out, when I was in the shower and when I got out she was furious for not telling her anything and going behind her back seeing a therapist and she was yelling at me a lot saying how could I keep this from her and calling me an ass for hiding it. I just broke down crying and apologized a lot saying I didn't know how to tell her but I was going to one day. She's been very dry and mad at me since and wants to take a break.

she didn’t take it very well, and is now ignoring me whenever she sees me. i’ve gotten mixed reactions from my friends about ending it too, saying i should have just gone through with it if i actually loved her. others are proud of me for ending if for both me and my ex’s sake. i’m feeling guilty about it, even though i found out she had been cheating on me with one of my best friends (who didn’t know we were still dating and apologized a ton) while she dated me.

input: Okay, so I, a 13-year-old, work small jobs for money. Rake some leaves for a neighbour for 5 dollars, mow the lawn for another 5. Really simple jobs that give me some money to buy what I want. So we were at the mall, and I wander off with 10 dollars and went to Subway. I buy a simple Meatball Marinara for 6.00, and some chips for a dollar. With 3 dollars left, I decided to save them and go to find my mom who is sitting in the playground area with my brother sitting right next to her. I promptly sat myself next to her, and began to eat my food. My brother started whining about how he was hungry, so I instinctively went and handed him my bag of chips. But; this didn't satisfy him. He started CRYING about how he wanted a sandwich.

Now; my brother REFUSES to eat any sandwich other than the Turkey Italiano Melt(T.I.M), which is 6.75. I only had 3 dollars. 

Now, the wining PISSED my mom off. (Keep in mind this is my biological mom, who I see a few times a year. I have a way better stepmom)  She DEMANDED I buy him a sandwich. I explain he only eats the T.I.M, and I didn't have the money for it. Angrily she hands me about 5 dollars, and I take my brother to buy it. I'm staying at her house for the weekend (right now im in the closet because its the only place I can get away from both of them. Its a small house, and me and my brother share a room here.) and shes actually pissed at me for not being able to buy my brother a sandwich even though it was my own money I earned??? AITA???

Now complete the following example-
input: So some backstory, in my English class we are studying a text by a Nigerian women, it's basically a collection of short stories with there own characters focused around the lives on women in Africa during certain events.

We where given the essay topic

""Jumping monkey hill highlights the pressures women are placed under at the hands of men"".

I chose to do the thing that every other teacher at my school recommends and agree/disagree not completely either. So I said that yes it does show that but it also shows how men can be placed under that same pressure. (As it does, it's about a group of people at a writing conference (men and women) and the old man running it is a pedophile who harras some of the women, the story rather clearly shows the men feel pressure not to say any thing as the man can provide them with opportunity. (Very clear).

I got my essay back and the teacher *corrected* my intention to be that women as supposed to what I originally said ""jumping monkey hill explores how women are pressured by those around them, however it also highlights that men can face the same pressure""

She ""corrected"" it to not include the bit about men. 

When she came over and asked me (and the rest of the table) if we had any questions about our feedback. I in no uncertain way said that I think she's wrong, and that the point of a contention is to state your interpretation, my interpretation was that and she has no right to edit that contention if it's completely related to the essay topic as it was. 

Everyone at my table seemed to think I was being rude and sexist for pointing that out.... 

This was a practise essay but I just got the three options for our assessed essay and all three focus exclusively on women (although the story does explore things like religion, race, war, politics, immigrants and so much else) even things that could super easily be multi gender she's chosen to say only happen to women. 

Am I the asshole for choosing to disagree with these topics all going along how women are the victims ect ect.

*I'm not sexism I believe in just testing everyone the same, if gender isn't needed to make a point (and imo the only time it is is when talking about physical differences) I just don't think you should make things about gender, if she was doing the same thing about men my response would be the same.*

input: I have been a long-time lurker on my main account but created a throwaway to post because I don't know if my GF uses Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

This happened during break, and it's really been weighing on me. 

A few days ago, my GF and I had planned to hang out, but the day of, she said she couldn't make it because she needed to help a family member move.

We are kind of long-distance couple: I only come back home on the weekends, so hanging out is tricky for us. She also hangs out with her friends on the weekends as well and not during the week. (This comes up later in the story).

This wasn't the first time this had happened; it happened once three months back as well but she said that she was with a family member atm. So I was kind of upset that this had happened twice in a row, so I told her how I felt. We don't really have that many chances to hang out because of my weekend constraint, and most times when I try to set up a date, she's been busy. However, she hangs out with her friends on the weekends once or twice a month. We've planned out three dates, and have only been on one.

During our conversation, I also brought up how we had only hung out once during our entire relationship (5 months now), but she had hung out with her friends 3 times in the past two weeks. After that, she's been distant, and this morning, she told me that she was upset that I brought her friends into the conversation.

I felt like I was trying to make a point that she wasn't spending as much time with me, but AITA for bringing it up? Am I just jealous?

I will clarify if you guys need additional info.

input: About two weeks ago, I decided to try going vegan. I didn’t eat a lot of meat before so it wasn’t a hard change for me. I can’t tell you why I decided to go completely vegan all together. It’s just something I wanted to try so I did it. And I really enjoyed it. I’m having a lot of fun planning creative meals and buying interesting produce. I also like the way my body feels. I no longer feel heavy or bloated after meals. 

My boyfriend and I are both 25 and we have been together for six and a half years, and living together for five of those. He is a serious carnivore. When I chose to change my diet, I tried my best for it not to affect him. I made him steaks and chicken to “supplement” my dinners. I bought him regular cows milk and regular butter. If he doesn’t want to go vegan, I understand and I won’t make him.  

Last night we went to dinner at one of our favorite bars and he wanted to stop for ice cream at his favorite place on the way home. I suggested that we stop at the grocery store instead (same parking lot) so that I could get some dairy-free ice cream instead. He did it, but it the most passive aggressive way possible. He glared at me and stormed off as I was trying to pick out what flavor I wanted. It was frustrating, but I just tried to brush it off. When we got home, he went to the garage to work on his boat and then went to bed without me. (Granted, he is exhausted from three weeks work with no breaks) 

This morning I sensed he was still upset and I asked him about it. He said he couldn’t understand my diet change and it was upsetting him. He didn’t want me to do this forever and he would be embarrassed to tell his friends and family. He said it would be okay if I were just vegetarian but vegan is too much. 

I did do this without talking to him about it first, but if I had talked to him first I feel like he would have tried to talk me out of it. I also don’t know if I’m going to do this forever, but I also can’t give an end date... 

AITA for going vegan without consulting my boyfriend? 

TL;DR: I went vegan and I liked it. My carnivorous boyfriend is now embarrassed of me and gets upset when I eat.

When he’s on and I’m on at the same time, we’ll usually play something together with a few other friends. 

Question:

Sometimes I’ll be doing something like playing a different game, practicing guitar, or hanging out and watching T.V and he’ll be like, “wow always gotta do what you want to do, and not anything I want to do”. Kind of makes me feel bad. My question here is, should I be dropping everything to play with him whenever he wants? We used to play different genres a while back, but I got bored and returned to our main game. Other than that, I rarely really like to play other games, because we have different interests, and I thought I don’t really domineer his choices with mine at all. If it’s a game I enjoy and I’m not doing anything, I’ll hop on. If it’s not, I might depending on the game and if I’m not busy. Recently I think I’m in this mindset where, if i want to play something then I’ll get on it, and if he doesn’t want to then cool, that’s fine. People have different interests. AITA?

My dad has been in and out of jail and I rarely have got to see him or have a relationship. 

I'd like to have some photos but my mom won't let me even take any of her photos to a Walgreens Photo Center to get them copied. 

I understood when I was a minor that if it was her rule that I did not have my own photos of him for whatever reason then I had to listen even if I thought it was weird (they're ""her photos"" was and is always what she says. I can look at them in photo albums but can't have any of my own copies), but now I am adult and I think it is unreasonable that she not let me have photos of my dad because seriously wtf? 

Basically what I want to do is temporarily steal the photos and just get them coppied myself without her permission. I know stealing is wrong and you can't just take people's stuff and do whatever you want with it because you feel entitled to... But I feel really really entitled to this? Is my entitlement justified enough to break this general rule?

Now complete the following example-
input: Before I start, here's a quick apology for my somewhat poor English. ( It isn't my native language.)

First some backstory: Whenever our school schedules match up, I ride back home with one or two friends. Let's call them girl A and boy B. I am good friends with both of them, but they despise eachother. Most of the time I flip a coin and decide who of the two I go home with. Today it was girl A, she asked me to meet up with her at the lockers after the sixth hours and from there on go home. She didn't show up and thus I biked home with boy B.

Turns out the girl quickly grabbed her and her boyfriend's coat so they could quickly get away without anyone else noticing. But I asked some other friends and they told me she was already gone.

But girl A just so happens to live somewhere on my way home. Me and boy B were having a laugh  and thought of a 'prank' we could pull on her. The prank was moving her, locked, bike and then slowly send her more and more pictures of the bike eventually revealing it's location. Turns out her bike was in the garage but her boyfriends was still on the driveway. So we took his bike instead.

We sent a picture of the bike every 30 minutes or so, but it turned out none of the two looked at their phone the 3+ hours they were together. ( or they just didn't open our messaged idk) Next day we told them about what we thought was a funny thing to do. But they got really pissed at us. I told them it was just a joke and there were no bad feelings or anything. But alas they were still annoyed. I asked her how long they looked for the bike and she replied with: 'idk, my mom looked for it.'

It's now another day later and they're still pissed at us. I really don't think it's that bad of a prank to pull and they don't really have any reason to be upset since they didn't even search for it themselves. This might al be my misguided opinion, hence I'm writing this post.

So reddit please help me out, AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: Hey there! Thanks, first of all, thank you for taking the time to read this.

&amp;#x200B;

I was in a Long Distance Relationship with this cute girl from the opposite hemisphere for 4 years and a half, we talked every day for hours at an end, I helped her through some really awful times in her life as well through some very suicidal months, likewise, she helped me through some awful times of mine.

She suffers from some mental illnesses and she was taking medication for that as well as some other things, I encouraged her on anti-depressants due to her family situation, where she was not abused, but one of her parents is terminally ill and she cares for them.

Recently before the break up, I had been busy due to being close to graduation from the military academy, but I still did my best to be with her despite everything and we were happy, until she started to grow distant more and more, being depressed for seemingly no reason, and spending less time with me. I was devastated, but tried to understand her and still was there with her, I had bought an airplane ticket to go visit her, and so it was set, I logged onto my computer to tell her I had requested leave for a while, and had bought a ticket to go visit her.

That day, before I could even tell her, she  dumped me with a massive text wall that was unlike her writing at all,  claiming she was just not attracted to me anymore, trust me - you know somebody's writing style after 4 years of chatting with somebody over voice and text, and acted extremely could, although we stayed ""best friends"" since we both cared for each other

I burned the ticket in a fit of emotion, which sucked in hindsight, I could have at least gone sightseeing or something.

A little less than two weeks later, she told me she has got a new group of partners (We were monogamous, although she flirted with the idea of being poly once) and spoke to me about them, they seemed extremely manipulative at times and not very attached to her, she introduced me to them a few times through multiple opportunities, and they were quite harsh and respectful of me.

Her entire family, she told me, is around ""15 or more"" people, she isn't even sure, but she claimed to be happy, from what little we speak, she seems to be growing erratic and I'm concerned she might have been encouraged by them to go off her meds or something.

&amp;#x200B;

So reddit, AITA for all of this? I can't help but feel bad for being unable to let go of her or something, and maybe that I'm just paranoid over her new partners or something.

During the movie we occasionally laughed at the funny scenes and kissed a bit during the romantic scenes. After the movie ended we were about to leave, then the husband of the family gets up and approaches us. He says ""You guys need to shut the f*** up"". Mind you his daughters were there too maybe 9-12 yrs old. And literally walks away. My girlfriend and I were shocked and didn't say a word. During the movie this man did not even ask us to be quiet. Later we walked into the lobby and the man is just staring at us. The wife later makes a comment and says ""my daughters behavior was better than yours"". We both just walked away and did not want to escalate the situation. Later me and my gf just talked about it for a bit. Although she didn't seem too bothered I thought that it kinda ruined the mood the rest of the date. AITA in this situation?

input: My wife and I are going through some shit, that's not the issue. 

We have an agreement that when she went out with friends she'd be allowed to make out with guys/girls and have fun. There's only a few rules involved: 1) don't be stupid and put yourself in unsafe situations, 2) must be one and done, no repeats 3) don't forget you have a husband.

So she came home one night after going out with friends, and everything was fine, until she called me another guy's name mid sex.

Then I find out she's continued to Snapchat him.

I asked for one of two things to happen. 1) that she cut all ties with him, or 2) tell him she's married. Both of which she refused to do on the basis that ""he's not from here and I'll never *see* him again"" I lost my cool and the argument ensued where I was told I was overreacting.

AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: I (28F) have a number of friends who are on a particular fad diet. They've had great experiences and like to talk about that with our larger friend group, myself included. I have no inclination to try this diet, but I'm happy that my friends are happy.

I am on the thicker side so I've dealt with people making passive aggressive comments about diets my whole life. Enough people have outright told me I need to diet so much that I've developed a sensitivity to any talk of diets, thinking they might be a comment on my weight.

I am healthy and am happy with my weight, but this wasn't always the case. I was diagnosed with EDNOS (catchall term for eating disorders that aren't anorexia/bulimia) when I was younger, and I'm currently working with my therapist to manage my mental health as I take care of myself physically. One of the steps for this has been focusing on overall health over exact weight, and I don't actually know how much I weigh know since I've avoided a scale for so long. I feel better than I did a few years ago, so to me, that's good enough.

However, when one of my friends says things like ""I can't eat this, I only have 20 carbs left for the day"" or ""\[Mutual friend\] is doing well, she says she lost 3 pounds last week"", I go to a bad mental place. If this comes up while we're eating, I'll immediately stop. I feel sick and feel an overwhelming urge to harm myself to get rid of my excess weight.

WIBTA if I asked my friends to stop talking about this diet around me, especially the parts with numbers? I'm afraid of it seeming like jealousy (and on some level I wonder if I am just jealous) but it's hurting me to hear it.

Now complete the following example-
input: I met this friend online 2 years ago, hit it off immediately like we were long lost sisters, I love her but we're the same person almost down to a T, both dealing with mental health issues as well as physical. We naturally bonded and talked almost everyday, got into a huge fight where I was admittedly the asshole for blowing up on her and a mutual friend, eventually we made up and last year we started talking again. My friend (who I'll call A for convenience) sometimes mentioned a guy, but we didn't talk about that too much since she's really reserved about her personal life, which I understand, but sometimes get a bit offended with since I'm super open about my personal problems (like I'm being now I guess). 

&amp;#x200B;

One day her ex hit me up on twitter. I'd tweeted something about MBTI and he loves that thing so we talked the entire night about that. I mentioned her bc she also liked MBTI and he said he should send her his regards since they hadn't talked in a while and that he missed her, and I didn't think much of it (this will be relevant later). It appeared to me he was a bit flirty and I have to admit he ticked some of my boxes - he's incredibly well-spoken (which at my age is rare) and has a weird sense of humor, a bit of dad jokes mixed in with dark humor, not to mention liking some of my favorite movies and anime. It was a pleasant night of talking, nothing happened because I had an idea there'd been something going on between him and A and didn't want to stick my foot in that. Also I wasn't so incredibly attracted to him that I'd risk a friendship over that (well, guess what!)

&amp;#x200B;

I was a bit conflicted and told our mutual friend that T (her ex) had hit me up and that I'd enjoyed talking to him. I asked if  I should tell A, since I didn't want to go behind her back, especially since we were on good terms now. My friend said I should say something just to get it off my mind, so I did. A has the weirdest reaction ever, like she was clapping at a really elaborate comedy shtick which just left me kind of dumbfounded. She laughed super hard about it and I decided to play along, told her that we didn't talk about much of anything. A asked if I'd mentioned her. I said yes, because of MBTI, and said he'd told me he missed her and was going to hit her up. She said that wasn't possible, since she'd blocked him a year ago... I just thought that was weird and didn't think much of it, but she kept talking about how manipulative he was and how he was such a disgusting person who ruined her life and manipulated her for years to his benefit. I was starting to lean toward him being an asshole. But then I kept talking to him and he was always super nice to me; a superficial kind of nice, but nice nonetheless. From a rational point of view, he hadn't done anything to me, so why should I hate him? 

&amp;#x200B;

We kept talking but not for long. I guess the combination of A talking shit about him with me and him being aware that we knew each other and we talked made for a weird atmosphere. I don't regret it much, but I like being on good terms with people. We didn't stop talking because of what A said about him, just there wasn't much interest on my part (he kept replying to my instagram stories and complimenting me, so I guess he was a bit attracted but I can't say for sure). 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, A was never open about what happened between them, despite my insistence. I insist because I don't want to hate someone just from what my friends say; while I understand sometimes they are right to be mad, I also think there are always two sides to the story, and so I'm usually skeptical, even when they tell me the whole story. I hate being unfair to people just because someone pretty much ordered me to, which is kind of what happened. She started to become increasingly paranoid about me and him, asking if we were talking much and what we were talking about. A bit of backstory: T and A had known each other for some 4 years I think and they dated for two weeks. They never met in real life, he was an asshole to her, pretty much manipulating a naive girl into sending him nudes and being there for him while he went around flirting with other girls. I KNOW he was shitty, which is why I didn't want to get very involved with him, but I also didn't want to be outright a bitch (or a white knight I guess). 

&amp;#x200B;

So one day T says ""hey we need to talk"", and I get a bit scared. He says I probably know that it's about A. He tells me he tried to talk to her, which I know because she showed me: he was super casual saying he missed her and she basically told him to fuck off and that she never wants him in her life again, saying how after they broke up he'd hit on her best friend and now he was doing the same thing to me just to get to her. Well, I don't want to be the one to say it but IT DID GET TO HER. I sent a print of the ""hey we need to talk"" bit to the group chat I had with A and our mutual friend. I had stuff to do so didn't deliver (also bc I was nervous about A's reaction since he'd pretty much trash talked her to me after the initial message). A asked ""where's the rest? can you send the prints?"" and I kept postponing it until she lost it and pretty much bullied me into showing her the convo. I said I didn't want to because it was going to hurt her, and she said she had the right to be hurt. I almost had a panic attack bc she wouldn't stop blowing up my phone. Before you say it, yes I know I messed up here and it was natural that she wanted to see the prints, but I told her what he'd said in them (albeit in a much nicer way since T was really a bitch to her). She wouldn't stop pressuring me to give her the damn convo, so I said fuck it, if you want to let your ex who you dated for 2 weeks affect you this much then be my fucking guest. Btw I tried to defend her in the prints, saying I understood why she blocked him and didn't want to talk to him. I wasn't SUPER WHITE KNIGHTE-Y about it, because I wanted to hear his side. Yes, the side of an abuser, I know I know. So after she saw the prints she said she didn't want to talk to me again about T or anything for a while and left the group chat. I didn't go after her, but I went into a panic that night, talking to my best friends trying to understand what exactly had happened. She usually insisted I show her my convos with him, meanwhile I never showed him any convos with her... Because he just didn't care. Now if you ask me, A has a great boyfriend now so I really don't understand how this affects her so much. I've also never had a boyfriend, but I have talked to my share of almost-boyfriends online, so I know how to spot a manipulative asshole and cut them right off. A didn't and she suffered for it. I suffered the first time, then I learned to get over it. 

&amp;#x200B;

To sum up, A tried to talk to me again for a while, but I accidentally mentioned his name twice and she said she couldn't do it anymore so she left mid-conversation. I think she overreacted a lot, especially for someone who seemed to be so close to me. Btw I haven't talked to T since November when all of this stuff happened. Now I know how much of an asshole he is, but only because another friend who knew him told me since she wouldn't open up about it. A wished me a merry xmas to which I replied ""merry xmas to you too, but when are you going to reply to me?"". Took her some 10 days to reiterate that she was offended and couldn't understand how I could do that to her, and that maybe we really weren't compatible after all. She might be right...

&amp;#x200B;

So, reddit, am I the asshole for not taking her at her word and talking to him regardless? (Or also, am I the asshole for taking printscreens and posting them to the group chat? Actually I am, and I know that one, so don't mention it, I've learned my lesson.)

M wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

Now complete the following example-
input: On Monday I woke up at 5:30 AM and noticed my phone was not charging. Immediately went to go see if my charger was plugged in, and smelt something burning. Turns out, my charger was melting and my pillow was smoking, which I assume means I was minutes away from a devastating electrical fire. All is well, and the situation was handled. 

My mother happened to text me later in the day and asked me how I’m doing. I said well, and then told her about what happened to me. She said that she’s glad I’m okay, and followed up with several questions about what I’m going to do about the situation (alert my building/landlord, charge my phone elsewhere, etc.). 

After we had settled those things l, I communicated to her that I felt lucky and that I must have good karma. She followed it up with, “that, and I pray for you everyday 😘”

Now, for a bit of back story. She raised me catholic, and both of us have hit a series of crossroads with our faith. I’m soon to be 24, and have decided over the past 2 years that I’m definitely an atheist. Being raised in that environment, it always seemed like I could never mention that, so I attended church silently and never said anything about it despite my deep down feeling that it’s all bullshit. 

She got remarried in 2010, and is incredibly involved in her church community. She is no longer Catholic, she just “reads her bible and tries to love people.”

She’s aware that I think religion is crap, however she refuses to have a conversation with me about it. Despite these facts, she continues to drop off comments like the one above, which I interpret as a deliberate attempt to have me force the conversation. 

Well, I wasn’t in a very good mood so I replied and told her that in a religion where being humble and modest are virtues, it’s incredibly arrogant to think that **your** prayers saved my ass from being turnt to ashes, as well as communicating that I can tell it bothers her that I don’t believe in God.

Needless to say, it didn’t go over that well and she didn’t reply to me after I accused her of trying to bait me into a conversation about it endlessly.

Reddit, do I need to apologize, and AITA for calling her arrogant?

input: My gf decided to drive to a trivia night at a local bar and was not going to drink so she could drive home. 

As sometimes happens to us all, she ended up drinking and could not drive home. I received a call whilst in my car asking me to come and pick her and her car up and drive her home. 

I said no, because I would have to drive home, get an Uber out to the bar (20 mins away), it was late and I had just finished work. 

I immediately offered to come pick her up. I would always do that, no questions asked, no matter where she is, to ensure that she is safe. But she refused saying she didn’t want to go back to the bar in the morning to pick up her car. 

I said that is what I was offering, take it or leave it. And that she got herself in that situation because she shouldn’t have driven if she was going to drink. 

She called me an asshole. Am I?

Now complete the following example-
input: I live in an apartment building in downtown Philly. I've lived here for more than five years so I'm used to city life and I don't expect it to be quiet. I'm used to the sounds of traffic, sirens, and drunk assholes shouting outside (mostly on the weekends) but a 24-hour convenience store and sandwich shop recently opened up right across the street from where I live and the level of drunk shouting and screaming has gone through the fucking roof. It's really bad, you guys.



Packs of drunk assholes chanting Eagles chants at the top of their lungs for twenty minutes at a time and getting in the street, blocking traffic, making drivers trying to go past lay on their horns at two am is something I can handle on weekends because I don't have to work but its EVERY GODDAMN NIGHT and it's killing me.



Sure my apartment is in a somewhat busy area but it was relatively peaceful until that convenience store came in and attracted all of the people who left bars at closing drunk off their ass but who don't want to go home yet. I tried looking up the non-emergency police number but that number is basically only open during regular day/office hours. And I don't see what my apartment management or the convenience store can do about it because these people are technically not in the store when their screaming at the top of their goddamn lungs in the middle of the street.



What I want to do is fill up a bunch of water balloons and keep them in a bowl in my fridge so they're nice and cold and throw them at the shouting people to try to get them to stop. Even if it doesn't get them to stop entirely, I have to think it would make them leave the area at least. I would only do this if it's past 1 am mon-thurs and I would use those mini balloons so no one gets soaked or anything, I don't want to damage anyone's property or anything, just give them a splash of cold water as kind of a friendly 'shut the *fuck* up, mofo'. I just honestly have no idea what else I can do to change the situation that will actually enact some form of change.



So if this is an asshole move, let me know but also let me know what else if anything I can do, I'm seriously at my wit's end.

input: My 4th hour science class is my least favorite class. I always feel like I’m an outsider from the pre established groups of students. My opinion is never taken into account when looking at things that involve me. The biggest example of this is when the entire class had an debate on how to pronounce my name and no one listened to me pronounce my name. So flash forward to Friday December 7th. My birthday is on Saturday December 8th. So during the last five minutes of class my teacher reminded us about my birthday. So the entire class attempted to sing happy birthday. I finally had enough when I heard the many ways people attempted to pronounce my name. I grabbed my things and walked out of the classroom.  I know I should have asked to use my pressure pass but I was just thinking in the heat of the moment. The entire song felt like nobody was being genuine and just wanted to get through the day. In fact that was the only time anyone mentioned my birthday for the rest of the day. I still wonder if my actions were valid at the time or should I apologize to everyone for walking out.

Now complete the following example-
input: Okay so context! My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.

Fast forward to last week when he lets me know that it’s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i’m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he’s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i’m now aware that he’s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that’s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.

Now here’s the big issue. I’ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It’s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it’s just plain weird to me. I’ve cried about it all week because I can’t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.

I tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn’t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don’t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it’s something I need to deal with on my own. It’s killing our relationship because he now says I should’ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.

Am I the asshole?

input: To start this off, I will go ahead and say the other person is definitely not the asshole in this situation. The person I made the joke to, a friend of mine, had lost her mom a few months ago and I made the mistake, but I still feel like an asshole for it because of her reaction.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, I was hanging out with a group of friends and we all went out to dinner. At some point or another, the person I had accidentally made this joke to asked me some question, I don't remember what they said, but I responded with ""your mom."" The second it came out of my mouth, I processed what I was saying and who I said it to, and automatically apologized, but she was reasonably pissed off and sad due to her situation. I don't really expect her to forgive me or anything, but it would be great. I don't know really what I could do further to make it any better, but I just don't want to hurt her too much, you know?

input: I'm in an LGBTQ organization for students at my college. There's someone in an officer position that's been a terrible person to most of our officer base.  This is a completely unpaid student organization. This will not impact anyone's livelihood. 

Context: 
-They are the only straight officer and they're known for making super inappropriate jokes about race and sexuality. When confronted they refuse to apologize, and continue making jokes at our expense.
- They blew up on the group chat one night calling an officer a bitch for asking why they were opening the conversation aggressively. At the meeting they called us to because of this they said we ignored them when they brought up issues, but every time they did it was as a joke.
- On multiple occasions this person has spoken to our members and told them that other officers don't deserve their positions 
-Some of us are physically threatened by them and it's to the point where we dont want to bring up issues. 

They have never apologised for anything they've done. When we being up serious issues to this straight person who's thrown slurs at someone and tells our officer base that we ""look too queer to talk to administration"", all we get is ""oh okay"" or ""alright"".
This person claims that they will try harder but theres been no change and recently they jumped way over our heads to start talking to some people outside of the school without our permission.

I want to talk to a member of the organization to see if they'd run against this person at our upcoming election. The dude technically does their job but they make everyone super uncomfortable and multiple people want to quit because of their presence.

Now complete the following example-
input: My youngest brother is 12, doesn’t have a phone due to losing everything and just not being responsible in general. Everyday at 2:30pm I pick him up from school and every other day I take him to and pick him up from karate 5-6pm. My parents insist I do this because they are either at work or just got home from work when he needs rides. My other brother works from 3-6 after school and can’t give him rides either. The thing is his school is 0.7 miles from our house and karate is 0.2!! Literally down a block and a half from our house. My mom insists he needs rides because it’s too cold and night, and he used to have a big instrument from school but he doesn’t anymore and definitely can walk. 

Yesterday was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Ever since I started picking him up, a year ago, he never looks for my car. If I’m not right up front, he waits around where I generally can’t see him, then walks home. His school is BUSY and I have come and park 15-20minutes early just so he sees my car. If I have to park across the street he won’t even look. Once I drove in circles trying to get him to notice and even yelled out the window and he just kept walking. 
This happens way too often. Yesterday I waited 25 minutes just to get a call that he walked home from karate. This was the 2nd time in a row this happened. I was only 2 cars from the entrance (parked facing it so maybe only 25ft or less) but a truck blocked my view and I could not see if he was there. 

When I got home I was livid, I pay for my own gas and I waste SO much just driving to get him for no reason. And in the winter I leave my car on so I don’t freeze, making me waste even more gas. I told my parents I’m not giving him rides anymore, he can walk. They went on and on about how they can’t give him rides and it’s not a big deal. They didn’t even tell him to look for my car, they said it wasn’t his fault. I just don’t understand how many times can this happen before he looks for my car for once. He’s not an idiot but wow I get so mad because he can’t get simple stuff like this in his head. 

When I got home later that night I was told he was upset and it’s my fault. I didn’t even talk to him, I just told my parents I’m done with this ridiculous and not giving rides anymore. Apparently he overheard and is upset because I was being a jerk??  

Anyway today my mom went to pick him up, GUESS WHAT HE DIDNT LOOK FOR HER. And she ended up just leaving and he walked home. She said he can walk now but is still mad at me for not giving him rides??? 

TLDR; my brother walks home when I try to give him rides because he doesn’t look for my car, but I’m the jerk for not wanting to waste my time/money anymore.

input: I don’t like my parents bugging me so much about my grades. Maybe if they weren’t always so pushy about it, possibly I’d actually care about my grades. Now, not saying my grades are bad, but like, I don’t like them constantly checking my grades. Isn’t a progress report every 6 weeks plenty? Thing is, my dad sorta works at the HS I go to.

Yeah.

It’s incredibly irritating to me, and I don’t like my parents getting involved in it, simply as I’m a rather reserved person. I’m strict about people touching my phone. I don’t like people on my laptop. Etc.

Now complete the following example-
input: Background: a young mother was murdered last year in my town (Ohio). The husband was arrested shortly after. Their 3 year old son was given to his closest relatives, the family of the husband.
The woman's sister lived in Turkey, and was originally from Isreal. She filed for a Visa to come to the funeral, but was denied. After 7 months, she was allowed a Visa to try and get custody of the nephew, as she feels he should not live with that side of the family. She said she would immigrate to the US, as she wouldn't want to force the child to relocate. The husband's family refuses to let her see the kid, and a legal battle is brewing.

Potential A-holism: A guy on my Facebook, someone whom I've known casually for about 7 years, often posts anti-immigrant, ""the media is the enemy"" things. He posts how the sister from Turkey has changed her FB status to ""living in (our town)"" and that this ""is how illegal immigrants sneak in, and how terrorists get their start.""

This post got to me, as someone who works at a newspaper covering the story, so I explained how she was here legally, and how she's seeking residency because she wants to take care of her nephew.
He called me a liar, accused me of falling for the media conspiracy (and told someone else to ""do what they can""to remain vigilant against liars), and said I was being racist for thinking he called her a terrorist ""just because she's Arabic."" At that point, he revealed he's the brother of the accused murderer, and the child is his nephew.

I apologized for not knowing, but still maintained that he can cry ""illegal immigrant"" all he wants, but ""terrorist"" went too far.

AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: This happened a year ago but now that I found this sub I'm curious to see what people think.

So last Christmas, my parents got me concert tickets. I was really excited about it. They got me two. I mentioned this to my friend, Ellie, just in a ""Oh my parents' got me this great gift!"" kind of way and she immediately started squealing, all excited that \*we\* were going to a concert. I didn't really correct her- the concert was not for another couple months, and it was very likely that I would invite her, but I hadn't then. Ellie comes from a LOT of money, and is pretty entitled with a lot of things. She once threw out a manual can opener because she wanted an electric one and ""manual can openers are for poor people"". Yes. Really. 

However, here's where I think I effed up. My parents got me two tickets. Ellie, assuming I would of course take her, asked if I could buy an additional 2 tickets so that her fiance and the guy I was talking to could come. I pushed back, said I didn't want to plan so far out, that I was just getting to know the guy I was talking to, that I didn't want to risk it. The tickets were expensive. After more back and forth, I did buy the tickets. Ellie was very much under the impression that I was taking her and I was definitely not correcting her, again because there was a good chance I would've taken Ellie and her fiance had everything stayed as it was. Also important to note, Ellie picked me up a bottle of wine at some point at my request. When I went to pay her for it, she declined and said something about how it was her concert ticket payment. I assumed she was joking, the bottle of wine was maybe $15 and her and her fiance's tickets combined were over $200. 

Anyways, like I said, I likely would have taken Ellie to the concert had things stayed the same. But they didn't. She started blowing off my texts and calls, and our plans in general. We made plans to go get lunch after classes one day, and she was going to pick me up from campus. It was raining. I waited for her for 20 minutes before she texted me and said she wasn't coming after all. Whenever I tried to talk to her about it, she would tell me she was busy and that I couldn't understand because my major was ""basically basket weaving"". If it matters, she is a nursing major and I am political science. My closest friend is an engineering major, and my other good friend is biology and pre-med, I totally understand when they don't have time for me, but I do expect the common courtesy of ""hey, I'm not going to be able to make it"" instead of just not showing up. 

Any time we did talk, she had something cruel to say about my other friends, the guys I liked, the clothes I wore. Hanging out with guys made me a whore, and the guy I liked wasn't good looking enough, and I was giving people the wrong idea by drinking at bars. That kind of stuff. I wound up blocking her and her fiance from viewing my social media because whenever they did, it opened the door for them to be critical. 

So with the concert coming up, I hadn't seen Ellie or had a pleasant nonconfrontational conversation with her in several months. The guy I liked had broken things off. So I went with three close guy friends of mine. Ellie \*\*freaked\*\* out. Her text to follow:

 ""You literally were such a weasel about this whole situation I didn't even want to have a conversation with you about it bc I would rip your head off and I've been so busy I haven't wanted to get worked up about it.  Do I need to just draw it out step by step? Bc obviously humanities has drained all your neurons.

A: you gave away the tickets without even asking which is a weasel move. If you wanted to just give them away bc we haven't been hanging out then you could have just told me before hand and had the consideration to alert me

B: even tho I only bought you 1 bottle of wine and have all the money in the world it was rude as shit for you not to offer to pay me back considering I bought it for you in exchange for a ticket and had gotten you another already 

C: the fact you made it look like you weren't going to the concert yourself and that you gave away all the tickets but actually you just sold the ones that me and (fiance) were going to use"" 

It got uglier after that, I eventually cut her and her fiance both out of my life. I've never felt I was in the wrong but I'm curious what other people think. To be totally clear, I paid for/was gifted all four tickets. The closest thing to payment Ellie gave me was a $15 bottle of wine. I didn't even know about the second one, if that matters, because I thought who the hell would think that is an equal tradeoff. And I have no idea why she was under the impression I wasn't going to the concert myself. I never said anything to that effect. I think probably because she figured out I'd taken her and her fiance off my social media, but that happened weeks prior. 

\*\*TL;DR:\*\* Made loose promises to take friend and her fiance to a concert, she started to act like kind of a crappy friend so I took other people, she FREAKED out. AITA?

So like i know that we arent really together or whatever (her words or not really because any discussion about where we are just ends with her telling me she doesnt want to talk about it), but it hurt me to see that regardless. 

Ive been trying to not be jealous or make comments and also trying not to go crazy when i dont see her all week, but i cant help but be hurt.

My friends suggested that i should do the same and try and move on. The thing is, I still want to try and make it work and i hate just casually dating its pointless as far as im concerned, but it does help me nkt be crazy and jealous in regards to her. So i went on a site and made a profile but i cant help but feel slimey and shitty. 

I really dont know of its good advice or if i should just give up because i feel like after a little over a year its worth fighting for still but i dont want to be the only one fighting even though shes the one who came and got me back... 
So AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm a junior in college, my sister is a senior in high school.

&amp;#x200B;

I got home from school for winter break on Sunday. My sister was out when I got home, so I didn't see her, and I ended up going to bed before she got back. Monday, she left for school before I woke up, so I didn't see her then either, nor did I see her that evening because she was working (note that I have not left my house since I got here). During this time, I didn't hear from her at all - the last meaningful communication I had with her was a couple weeks ago, when she texted asking if my boyfriend would buy weed for her friend group. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this afternoon. I am at home alone (entire family is at work/school) when I hear someone *pounding* on the window of our front door. It's my sister and her boyfriend, who just pulled up after leaving school early. This is the first time I have seen her since I got home. I let them in and say, ""Dude, where's your house key? You freaked me out."" My sister responds aggressively, ""I *left* it in my *room.*"" I try to make some half-assed joke about her driving around with out a house key on her key ring, which prompts her to yell ""*SUCK MY FUCKING DICK, OKAY?*"" immediately before going upstairs to her room.

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say, I have been in a bit of a shit mood since then, as it really hurt my feelings that my little sister does not apparently care at all about seeing me for the first time in months. She asked me why I seemed so ""grumpy"" as I was cleaning up the kitchen after dinner, and I explained to her that I was mad that she has either been ignoring me or actively being mean to me. She responded by going off on me for not being understanding of her busy schedule, saying that I could not have possibly expected her to say hi to me last night when she got home from work because she needed to go to bed (she got home at 9:30 PM and, while I do not know exactly what happened, I really doubt that she went straight to bed). I rolled my eyes at that, but said okay, and she once again immediately stormed off to her room after yelling, ""You can roll your eyes all you want but you're still a dick!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

So AITA for calling her out and saying that she upset me? Or for my reaction to her excuse? Or for not saying hi to her when I first opened the door? She's clearly pissed at me but I really feel like she has zero reason to be mad, especially when it seems to me that she was the dick in the first place. Enlighten me, please!

Now complete the following example-
input: A little of a backstory. I'm 31 non-native english speaker, have a 8 yo daughter, who lives with her mother. I have helped raise her, tho, been at her house, and all that, so I've been a part in her education/manners. Also, she spends every saturday with me.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago, a friend of mine from school got in touch with me via Facebook (we were classmates and good friends in school, but after graduation we went our separate ways). She tells me she moved back to town, she's got a kid (6 yo), got married, got divorced (husband cheated on her) and stuff. Since we've got kids who are around the same age, maybe we could meet up and the kids could play while we catch up. Sounds OK to me and my kid agrees, so we do.

&amp;#x200B;

They came to our house and they get along, playing until it's time to eat (tea time). So we are eating, and suddenly this kid farts. I look at him, and so does his mom, but we don't say anything. The kid then rips another one. My daughter looks at me kinda shocked, and the kid starts laughing and lets another one out. I look at my friend and she just looks me back and says ""kids will be kids"". So I look at the kid and say ""you shouldn't fart on the table, kid"" in my friendly-yet-firm dad voice.

&amp;#x200B;

He doesn't respond and starts eating his sandwich. He eats with his mouth open, talks while eating, and I can notice my daughter is annoyed. Suddenly, the kid farts again and starts laughing (again, mouth full with his sandwich bite.)

&amp;#x200B;

I got annoyed. He's 6, but he should at least apologize. So I tell him ""Hey, \[blank\], you shouldn't eat with your mouth open. And if you're gonna fart, at least apologize. I know farts can sound funny but we are eating. It's not polite."" His mom tells him to listen to me, and he kinda does (he still eats with his mouth half open, but no more farts.)

&amp;#x200B;

We finish eating and the kids go back to play, only my daughter now doesn't want to play with him. She asks if she can play with my phone, and the kid wants to play smash bros (wii U) so I put him against the CPU. Eventually, they have to leave. They live close so we walk. We let them at their house and everything seems normal, except is mom was silent the whole walk.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got tome, I text her saying my daughter and I got home safely. She texts me back a ""that's nice"" and then proceeds to tell me she liked the visit but was kinda annoyed of me lecturing her kid. That she get's it not the best behaviour but I should have overlooked it, and that the kid said he would like to come by again to play but didn't like me ""acting like a dad"". I tell her that I get her point, but in my house, and in my table, we behave, and that at no moment was I rude or harsh to her kid, I was acting mainly because my daughter showed concern. She responds that's ok, but to remember that ""kids are kids"". My daughter said she liked playing with him but ""didn't like him while eating"" (her words)

&amp;#x200B;

So, AITA here?

input: This happened a few hours ago and I'm still confused. TL;DR at the end.  


So my mate posts a picture to a group chat of him using a filter to look like some K-Pop star or something. Neither of us like K-Pop (I moderate an Anti K-Pop sub because I really hate it.) and we do stuff like that all the time to take the piss. Someone in the chat really likes K-Pop. I didn't think about that before replying ""Literally Disgusting"". Oh boy did I make a mistake. It really kicked off in the group chat with this person's friend having a go at me for ""making fun of something x is really passionate about."" I get told repeatedly to back off, but I didn't. Now I wasn't being stubborn just to be a jerk. Person x is the kind of person who will make fun of people 24/7 but can't take it themself. I'd had enough of them not having anything in the way of kickback for their shitty attitude and decided that if they were going to swing at me, I'd swing back. So anyway, after an hour or so of arguing and half a dozen people who weren't in the group chat messaging me about how person x was ""really pissed off"" it eventually dies down. Now I'm getting the cold shoulder from everyone in the chat bar my mate who just thinks its hilarious. I'm pissed off that person x is seen as a saint even though they just take the piss 24/7 without any kickback whatsoever, but when I decide to have a go at them I'm suddenly a terrible person. Oh and also I'm getting the whole snapchat story of ""why do I bother"". Does this make me the asshole?

TL;DR: I didn't back down from an argument because the other person can't take someone taking the piss out of them but does it to everyone else.

input: An acquaintance of mine recently got married and had a college mascot at his wedding. This isn't some small college either. This is a college that any football fan, even casual ones, would be familiar with. Everyone at the wedding thought it was cool, but I think it makes you seem like a douche. Even people who weren't at the wedding think it's neat that the mascot was there. From what I've gathered, the person who got married is friends with the person who is the mascot, and they asked them to do it. To me, it seems like a move to show that they are better than everyone else. Like shouting ""Oh, you can't have a college mascot at your wedding? You must be poor."" The kids parents are really good people, but the kid is definitely the type to show his ""status"" as ""wealthy."" Hint: they aren't wealthy, their parents are. I hope this is enough info to be judged.

Now complete the following example-
input: To preface: I'm a guy, 17. My friend, X, is 18.   


So I've been friends with this X for about three years, but we don't see very much of each other because she dropped out of high-school at the beginning of the year, about six months after she enrolled at my school. We've hung out a couple times, and once she brought one of her friends with. I was fine with this, and we all went to the theme park together. Now, X doesn't live at home anymore - teenage grievances with her mother, who I'm on good terms with. Her mother, takes buys these tickets for us, partly because she just wants to see her daughter more often, and because she wants to make sure she's got some friends like me - the kind my grandmother would call ""the good sort.""  


So the theme park was fun and all, but her X's friend is kind of upset that I'm there, and she thinks I'm a bit of a downer since I didn't want to smoke. She kind of put a dampener on the night to be honest. All in all, however, it was fun and I talked to X about how she was going and all that, gave her some advice and went home, but I didn't really like her friend.  


We decided to hang out tonight at Timezone, and we've got plans to get some food and just walk the city - it's Schoolies time here on the Gold Coast, with all the year 12 kids who've finished school drinking and partying, among other things.  


She texts me, about half an hour ago, and asks if she could bring ""J"".  
So I explain to her that when she brings her friends I kinda feel like a third wheel, you know? She says she understands and it's okay, because he's just gonna play some games.  


I tell her I'm not sure, and ask who he is.  


""Ahaha my boyfriend."" ^(oh boy)  


Now, I know what some of you are thinking - I admit that I \*do\* like her, but I don't really think she's the right girl for me. ^(That's all I've got to say about that.)  


I tell her that I think I'm gonna give it a miss, but she says that he won't come then.  
I tell her not to let me stop you, and to have fun.  


I think that she's now under the impression that I want to be more serious with her, you know? I just think that it would be like before if she was bringing a friend, and it would be even worse if it was her boyfriend.

input: I’m currently a graduate student in an engineering program in America. I share an office with another grad student whose from a different country. She recently received a message on LinkedIn from a recruiter for a rather large computer/tech company advertising a few openings in there manufacture sector for chemical engineers. Due to being from another country and English as her third language, she had me help her draft all her emails to this recruiter and fill out the prescreening questionnaire and actual application. After she submitted all this info she showed me the job listing because she was worried she didn’t meet one of the qualifications.

Here’s where the WIBTA comes in. I scribbled down the listing number and looked it up later. Not only do I meet all the requirements, most of them I meet to a T. It’s basically my dream job, they’re literally hiring people to work on the process I’m writing my thesis on. Would I be the asshole if I applied for this job? 

I’m almost sure I’d get it over her. I’m defending 5 months before she is, and it’s a time priority hire. My skill set is also more aligned, she doesn’t meet one of the 5 listed qualifications, a programming background. She’s also international and has not begun applying for any form of permanent work visa or anything, where as being a citizen I can work with no restrictions. The real kicker is, the one thing she didn’t take my advice on is the expected salary range. She wrote 95k with a 10% bonus and relocation costs, for a job that pays on average 72k with 6% bonus. If I apply I’d use a much more reasonable salary range, most likely boosting my chances.

So WIBTA if I apply for the same job as my lab mate, a job I only found out about by helping her fill out her application?

&amp;#x200B;

I(f26) used to have a friend(f24) for years, I had previously felt somewhat uncomfortable.

I remember living with a boy who was my boyfriend for a short time, I invited her to the house and when I finished with him I realized that they became friends, I didnt give importance to that.

A couple of months ago I divorced my husband(m31) and I realized that the same thing happened, even though she knew the reason why I divorced him (he was unfaithful,cheat on me, and he was very manipulative) I warned her that to be careful since he was going to try to contact or add people that known  me to continue stalking

Recently (my fault for snooping) I saw that they became friends by instagram and she liked all her post.

I got upset and bothered, I wrote to her asking her what was going on and she told me that nothing, that I only have to worry about my life, I felt something betrayed because I thought she was my friend.

then she sent me screenshot where she talks with him (so i could see that nothing was happening) and in a part of the conversation she says ""you seem to be a very good boy, you dont seem to be what she tells me about you ..."" She also send her voice messages

Then, today, in the morning, I wrote to her and told her to dont talk to me anymore, and I blocked her.

input: My family has had a system for as long as I can remember that works as follows: 

On a communal device, one can limit the current user's turn to 30 more minutes by giving a warning.

My brother is now refusing to follow this system, going so far as to lie and state that the communal device is his personal PC.

I do have a personal PC, but the crux of the argument is that this communal PC is the only one with a VR system hooked up and the only one that could have one hooked up to it due to space constraints. 

Admittedly I'm not totally blameless: his argument is that he's playing with a friend who has a 2 hour limited timespan, however I gave the warning coincidentally 30 minutes before they got on. Rather than give me my 30 minutes immediately and then explaining the situation, he chose to play solo for that 30 minutes and THEN complain when I returned to claim my turn. He then proceeded to argue for a full hour claiming that he had an inherent right to use my *personal* PC to play his game. During this tine, I could have gotten my half hour and then he'd have the entire remaining timespan to play with his friend. Despite this, he has refused to admit his own lack of foresight so I'm settling this once and for all: AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: This is probably going to be a long one.

I'm a commercial cleaner, I absolutely love my job, it was perfect up until last Thursday. I work on a team with my best friend (Jay), and my boyfriend (Dee), how could it get any better right? Jay has been a close friend for about 6 years and I have been seriously dating Dee for 9 months now.

We drive to 6 accounts on Thursdays, since my car has been down a little over a month now, Dee has been picking us (Jay and I) up from our house. Obviously Jay and I live together and Dee lives about 20mins away from us. 

Here is where it gets interesting, my boyfriend has a decent car, the outside could use some TLC but the interior is immaculate. Dee is a genius when it comes to wiring, so as well as having an awesome sound system he also has the video display up front and we can watch movies on the way to our accounts. 

Jay has been struggling a bit with his alcoholism, he doesn't always drink on the job but occasionally he does, I dont judge as long as you get your work done, keep the liquor out of the accounts, and of course dont break anything. He has worked the better part of the last 6 months with no issues so I had no issue. 

This day though I could see signs that he had a little too much, and I told him, you're cut off from this point. He wasn't happy but obliged, or so I thought. 

Jay asked my boyfriend for his car keys so he could fetch a cleaner we forgot to grab from the car, goes outside and is unseen for 10 minutes, I go out and he is still in the car looking for the cleaner... it was on the floor where we told him it was. In the same back seat he was just sitting in, but for some reason he is sitting in the front driver seat. 

Fast forward to us finishing up the account and leaving, I am the last out because I have alarms to set. I get in the car and see my boyfriend pick up a cigarette that had been set on the dashboard after probably 2 hits and burned down to the filter... We both look at the dash to see a nasty melted gouge. Dee asked Jay if he was smoking in the front seat of the car... No was the response he got. We both look at the cigarette and sure enough Marlboro on the filter, (Dee smokes Newports and I dont smoke at all) Jay smokes marlboros. He asked again, this isn't your MARLBORO cigarette that burned up on my dash? Again no. 
At this point Dee is so angry he asks Jay to get out the car and ride with another team member to our last account. Jay exits and we sit for a second to take in the situation. 

Dee is furious, I get it, he is trying to sell his car, the interior had no damage up until this point. I try talking him down and eventually he does, although he does not want my friend back in his vehicle without an apology or the cash to replace the dash. Not so unreasonable, well Jay decides he is going to avoid Dee, I get it, Dee is pissed. 

Fast forward again, time to go, I was under the impression my other team member would take Jay home, he had messaged me on fb and said he would either ask or uber home. Come to find out he walked an hour and a half home despite the options he had. To add to this he posted on snapchat about how he has to walk home because people are ""childish"" and ""petty"". I am pissed when I find this out, because I find out later from my boss and another coworker. 

When Dee and I leave I saw Jay had left his food in the car...or rather in my boyfriend's daughter's car seat directly, and the plate on the floor, I try to hastily clean it up but no, Dee saw it and he came to the back seat to look for more, and starts pulling empty marlboro packs, Naked juice bottles, wadded up paper towel used to clean up some kind of red spill and more garbage from under the seat. These are obvi from my best friend because as I have said before neither of us smoke Marlboros and I know my boyfriend doesn't drink Naked. At this point there is nothing I can do to make Dee reconsider Jay riding with him.

Now I have Jay telling me over Facebook messages that he will make his own way to work. 

Ok then.

On Friday we started a brand new account, so both of my bosses as well as the regional leader is with us. I get to work with Dee and my boss asks where Jay is, I told her what he told me, he was making his own way, then I hear about the snapchat posts, personally I dont use snap but when I was shown the snaps I wanted to snap. My boss calls him and he states we just left him. Now I'm really pissed. My boss leaves to go get him and I tuck my anger down for a later conversation with my best friend. 

Unfortunately we had no time to hash things out right away so I figured at the next account we would sit down and talk. No dice, he asks my boss to take him BACK home, completely behind my back, to the point that I didnt know he was leaving until I got to the next account. I message him asking why he would do this, he tells me he's not getting in between me and my boyfriend, I told him this is not the case, there is nothing I can do for him concerning Dee and his car and how he should've come to him as a man and apologize. Jay goes on about how important Dee is to me and how this isn't my problem and he will do what he has to do from this point. I said yeah Dee is important to me, but so are you so man tf up and talk to this man before he decides he doesn't want an apology anymore.

The whole weekend goes by and Jay says nothing to me, we live in the same house yet had no interaction, so when today rolls around I do what I always do, get my things together and wait for Dee to call me and say he is here. When I leave I see Jay's room has no light and did not see him elsewhere in the house so I assumed he was already gone and leave. Minutes after leaving, I get a text saying how he wanted to apologize and how could we just leave him behind...

This is where I snapped, I told him straight up that I didnt even know he was in the house and if he really wanted to apologize to Dee he would've either asked me for his contact info over the weekend or been on point watching for him to pull into the driveway. Personally if it were me and my job on the line I wouldn't have bothered with shoes I would've gotten out there to speak my peace. He gets sassy with me about his walk home, and I told him he walked home because he wanted to, he could've just as easily apologized or asked the other team member (she was actually pissed he didn't ask her). I told him straight up that his priorities were screwed up and he needs to grow up and take responsibility for his choices, and that people aren't going to wait around to hold his hand through things. 

Then I started in on his snapchat posts I was getting hounded about by our office gossips who were trying to get all the juicy details of the story...

I asked him if Dee was petty for bringing him to work everyday without asking for gas money or even getting a thank you in return, yes he comes for me because I'm his girlfriend but in all reality he doesn't have to bring my friend too. Was my boyfriend petty every time he made pit stops so you could get your cigarettes or liquor, or take you to the store? I got no answers to this question, so I told him I wasn't going to be a member of his pity party. He states he didn't want a pity party, and I told him obvi you want pity cause you asked for it all over snapchat where our co workers can see and continue to message me about. 

I'm not sorry for telling him to grow up and be a man (hes 32) but I do wonder if I am an asshole in this.

input: My girlfriend and i were getting ready to go to the grocery store and our 16 month old daughter is playing with her baby alive. We kept trying to get shoes on her feet but she'd wiggle away to go back to her toy. Eventually i get tired of the back and forth so i take the toy and tell her she can have it back when we get back home. My daughter doesnt know very many words but she loves to back talk and give attitude, so shes fussing at ne for taking her toy and i say ""i dont care, you can have it back when we get home"". I thought i was being perfectly normal until my girlfriend starts getting mad at ne telling me not to say ""i dont care"" to our daughter. This completely blew my mind as ive been saying it and ive never gotten this kind of reaction. I ask why I cant say ""i dont care"" and her response is ""look it up"". I personally am not a fan of ""going with the flow"" especially when it comes to parenting, it just feels to me like one of those things where you just gotta do it how you do it because thats the beauty of it. 
I honestly feel like i didnt do anything wrong and shes just overreacting, but im here to ask. 

Am i the asshole here?

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm M18 and moved in with my dad and stepmom back in November. This is going to need a bit of background though I think before I start.

My dad has always been a drug user, from very heavy stuff back in the day to now only weed and alcohol. He's aggressive and abusive but also caring. Very narcissistic and outright stupid sometimes, but also smart and logical other times. He's very unpredictable but he's always been kind to me. My mom's side of the family, who I've spent most of my life with, all dislike him greatly. I've always defended him as much as I can, but I definitely understand and agree with them, to a degree.

Like I said above, my dad is unpredictable. An accurate metaphor would be a sparkplug. Since November, he's gotten progressively worse and worse, consistently yelling at my stepmom and myself for the dumbest things, like not putting enough creamer in his coffee or no mustard on a sandwich. This is seriously the things he gets so mad about, he has to leave for several hours and come back that night and ""apologize"". My stepmom and I discuss him frequently when he's gone and we have no idea what to do. He doesn't have a job, except from Uber-ing occasionally, and my stepmom works 40+ hour weeks at a restaurant to support us. I help out as much as I can with my financial aid, mostly by paying certain bills or just taking care of myself and taking that burden off of them.

My dad is still kind to me, but it feels a bit backhanded. He bought me an expensive game (AC Odyssey Gold Edition) for Christmas, which is awesome, and he buys the food I like and treats me with respect, but he also kicked in my door because I was struggling with my counselors to get a schedule at college. He fixed it afterwards and apologized, and we talked about it all. The next morning though, he barges in my room at 7 in the morning and yells at me for the exact same thing, despite having an understanding the previous day!

Recently I've just stayed in my room and kept it locked. I go out and get food when he leaves, and I talk very minimally to him. I feel like I can't do anything in this house without getting yelled at or even potentially hit. I always hear him yelling through the walls. He gets mad I don't talk to him and spend time with him, but what am I supposed to do? As a result I barely eat and sleep and live in constant anxiety about what he's gonna do next.

Am I the asshole Reddit? I don't know at this point. I feel justified in not giving him the satisfaction of being a dick and still getting what he wants (time with me). But I also feel really awful because he does a lot for me and doesn't ask much in return (unless he's being a massive prick). So please, let me know.

I had to reformat this post, so some details might be missing. I don't really have any other place to go, or if I do move, I wouldn't have the privacy and freedoms I do here (like having to sleep on a couch).

Now complete the following example-
input: So basically I have an old truck I have been wanting to sell for a while because it’s diesel and I can’t deal with all the problems as a teenager right now. My parents told me they would be fine with me selling it and buying a new truck as long as I understand they still own it. So I put it up for sale and a guy wants to trade me this really nice truck in great condition because he wants a diesel, and our appraisals are almost the same and I love the look of his truck and it’s gas and I’m very good condition. 

We chatted for a while and I sent him all the stuff about my truck and he sent me all his stuff and we agreed on trading this weekend. I told my parents about it and my dad keeps blowing it off and saying he is having second thoughts and wants to research some stuff before selling the truck.

Now, this is what my dad ALWAYS does when he’s not interested in me doing something. He just keeps trying to blow it off until hopefully I forget about it. So now I am set up to trade trucks with this guy and he is keeping it from other sales for me and my dad is telling me no now after he clearly told me yes earlier.

So this is my question: am I an asshole if I cancel this deal after I told the guy I would this weekend and he cancelled other offers with people? Or is my dad being the asshole for not letting me sell it after saying I could at any time?

input: When she followed it in the past she went through my followers (don’t know why) and found a girl I admittedly used to flirt with. I did unfollow her but didn’t appreciate the drama of my girlfriend.

Fast forward to the last week, she (my girlfriend) asked my if she could follow my instagram again and I refused, telling her I don’t want the drama because she’ll go through my followers or something like that again and nitpick. 

We fell out over this and spoke again tonight and she said she feels as if I’m hiding something, but I’m not, I really just don’t want her looking at who I follow. She can’t understand this and says it’s a deal breaker for her. 

I feel as if she prioritises her friends online over me and she brought this up saying I don’t prioritise her or her feelings if she isn’t allowed to follow any of my social media and call her a drama queen for being upset that she isn’t allowed to. I said that’s untrue. It’s not a big deal at all. She said she understands that it’s ‘just social media’ but the fact that I outright refuse to let her follow me is strange. I disagree.

input:    So my friend was getting her hair done from a hairstylist, (she does her business at her house) Since she didn't want to be alone she asked me to come over. Me and my sister came and went inside. About 3 minutes later she starts asking me if I was from Africa. I was like...""yeah why?"" 

Then she starts a lecture about how I was suppose to greet her since it's a common courtesy in Africa. At this point it gets very awkward...because she looked angry and thought I was rude for not greeting her when I came in. Which I would admit...I was in the wrong, but the fact that she had to point it out made everything really uncomfortable for me, and she kept looking at me from before and I didn't know why..i guess it was because she was waiting for me to say ""hello"" or something and so when I didn't...she felt like she had to point it out. 

Normally in my culture, if I was the one at home, I was suppose to greet the guest that CAME to my house. I don't know why she couldn't just greet me and welcomed me to her house instead...

Now complete the following example-
input: Another post has me wondering. Lately the only way my kid will stay quiet and still for diaper changes is if I let him hold my phone playing kids’ music and sing along. This is fine at home, and if I’m sick to death of Victor Vito and Freddie Vasco eating their burritos up and down the west coast, I can change him on the floor and deal with squirmy worm for a few minutes. In public, he’s tried to climb off changing tables multiple times in the last week, and when he isn’t trying to crawl off the edge he’s trying to pull to stand or he’s screaming his head off because diaper changes are the worst thing that’s ever happened to him.

FWIW, I’m not a bad singer so long as I stay in my chest voice - a bad asthma flare left me with chronic cough, some airway scarring, and a really gnarly transition to head voice. The music he likes is all well within my range, and we rarely make it through more than two two minute songs. I know he can throw my phone, I have a heavy duty case and I’m pretty confident it can take it. If I don’t sing along and dance and make silly faces, or if I just sing alone without letting him hold the phone or without playing music, we’re right back to attempting suicide by four foot headfirst plunge onto tile.

Now complete the following example-
input: Where I live, one is legally permitted to bike on the sidewalk as long as you yield to pedestrians. Whilst biking, I use bike or car lanes most of the time, but if I have to make a left turn using a crosswalk and I end up on the wrong side of the road, I'll usually stay on the sidewalk until I hit another crosswalk and I can get on the right side again.

This was the case today, and the sidewalk I was going down was relatively narrow (I would say double-file, give or take). I saw a dude walking towards me with his kid and his dog, so I moved as far right as I could and slowed down (there was enough room for us to pass each other). He continued to walk straight down the middle of the sidewalk, and when he got close enough that I stopped completely, he pointed at the bike lane next to us (going down the wrong side of the road) and said in a condescending tone ""You know, they have the bike lanes for a reason"" or something to that effect. I didn't really know what to do with this so I just said ""OK"" and started pedaling again. He then proceeded past me and kicked my back wheel decently hard.

I'm relatively sure he wasn't justified, but was there anything I could or should have done differently in the situation?

Now complete the following example-
input: So pretty much the title.
I (21M) am in college, and my friend is a 19M. For context, he lacks social awareness often can be irritating at times, but I know he means well.
Basically, he has crippling anxiety all the time and constantly needs validation for every choice he makes. I’m talking topics where no one else could possibly know better than himself, and yet he never trusts his own instinct. 
I’ve tried helping him by simply giving someone to talk to, however this is mentally exhausting. He’ll essentially say something bad about himself(often true), and want the other person to give him reassurance that it is not true.
 I’ve tried giving him validation to ease his nerves, but I honestly now feel like I am feeding a bad cycle by doing this.
As of now I simply avoid talking to him in most cases, as I feel like he needs to learn how to trust his own instincts for himself, and to stop needing validation from others.

What do you guys think? Should I be there for him and give him someone to talk to, avoid him and let him figure things out for himself, or do you think another option would be best?

Now complete the following example-
input: Hi folks.  A small confession, this isn't really worrying me or anything, but when I found out about this sub a couple of days ago I LOVED the idea.  (Am I the asshole for not posting a serious situation?  Lol.)    So anyway, I finally came up with a situation which I could share.  Happened about a year ago.

I live in Spain now and my first year here I met a young Spanish guy about my age in a club that we both attended.  I was visiting from another town.  We became quick friends and used to have deep life discussions and stuff.  Before each of us had girlfriends, we would hang out every 3-4 months.  I would always hop on a bus or whatever and go meet him where he lives (Seville), he would put me up in his house and I would pay for our meals.  

Well, once we got girlfriends, things started to peter out, but we maintained contact more or less.  One day, we had planned to meet up, and I made my usual travel arrangements.  At the last minute he bails on me because he ""isn't in a good space mentally"" (to my knowledge he has no diagnosed mental health issues, he was just feeling down or whatever).  I tried convincing him but hey, whatever, he doesn't feel well.  Fine.  I cancelled all my travel arrangements and didn't think too much about it.

About 6 months later we tried again.  When we agreed upon my visit I asked him, are you SURE this is what you want?  Because last time you bailed.  He said yes.  I confirmed with him, AGAIN, 1 week before my visit - again making SURE he wanted me to visit.  He says yes.  And finally, a couple days later, he calls and I already know what it's about.  He says, can I please NOT come because it turns out this is the only weekend he can be at his flat alone with his girlfriend.  I made a big deal about it this time, like, dude, you've done this TWICE now and I confirmed with you two times before making my arrangements.  You're gonna make me do this again?  And, he did.  I had to cancel all my arrangements, losing time, energy, and a bit of money.

After that moment I pretty much decided, hey, this guy has no respect for what's going on with me and is too wrapped up in his own crap to be a good friend for me.  So I was sad at ""losing him"" but I stopped talking to him.  Just didn't feel like he had anything to add to my life.  

It's not like we were super close, and this is totally platonic BTW, but we definitely had a strong friendship.  Not my BFF but probably (one of my) BFF(s) in this new country.

For whatever reason I finally called him today, told him that what he did wasn't OK with me, but that I didn't want to argue and just hoped he was well and all.  And that we should stay in touch.

So, AITA / WITA for pretty much cutting him out of my life for a whole year over this?

Note: He also did not try to re-establish contact with me in this period.

My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

Am I the asshole for wanting to wear the shirt I made just once?

Positive example 2-
input: Pretty much was hanging out with two friends. I was watching the Lakers game. They won at the very last minute and I immediately hopped up and celebrated. Before I could even finish celebrating one friend started going on about how the Lakers suck. It just pissed me off so much I screamed at her to get out my room until she left. 


She knows I'm a huge fan and she likes them too. She was only saying it to antagonize me. Am I the dick here?

Now complete the following example-
input: TL;DR at the end.

So it's Friday night. SO and I are playing video games when he gets a call at 9:30pm from a work friend who lives one street over, asking if we want to go over to his house to drink and hang out with some other friends.

I'm really not in the mood to go over there. I take medication every night for nausea and it doubles as a sleeping pill. I'd already taken this medication, plus I'm in my pajamas, about ready for bed. I told him he should go without me and that i was going to bed instead.

As he's leaving, I tell him not to do anything with any girls. He has never done anything with another woman as long as he's been with me, so I have no reason to think that he would tonight. I was mostly joking, but I'm also feeling a little self conscious. I'm in my second trimester of pregnancy, so I've started to get a little bit of a bump, plus I'm not pooping regularly and I'm extra gassy today. I just feel really unattractive and my anxiety brain was telling me he might think this as well. He obviously didnt find my comment funny, however.

Cut to about 10 minutes after he left. I'm in bed, getting settled in, and I hear glass breaking. I automatically imagine someone watching my SO leave and, thinking the house is empty, break in through a window. I jump up to lock the bedroom door and immediately call my SO, asking if he was in the house because I heard glass shatter. He didnt even seem phased by this, from what I could tell. He tells me he'll walk back and for me to get his gun by our bed. 

While I'm waiting for him to get back, I start to realize a couple things. 1.) We have a dog who barks if he hears anything strange at night. He w as s suspiciously quiet. 2.) The shattering noise definitely wasnt loud enough to be something big, like a window breaking. I started to feel pretty stupid right as my husband walks into the apartment.

He clears the house and doesn't see anyone, so I go to check the living room. Yup. Our dog licked a bowl off the coffee table and it shattered. He *never* does this, but the table was pulled a little closer to the couch tonight, so I guess he took his chance.

As we're cleaning up the mess, my SO says ""there aren't even any girls there!"" I was sincerely confused by this, so he explains that the only women at the party are there with their husbands. The way he says all this to me, I can tell that he thinks I broke the bowl so that he would have to come home. I told him, ""I didnt do this so you would have to come back!"" But he just muttered something that didnt make sense and then left for the party again. Didnt seem like he was in a great mood.

I do feel pretty stupid about not checking the house to actually see if someone was breaking in, but was I really being that big of an asshole to put him in a bad mood like this?

TL;DR: SO went to a party while I stayed home and I told him not to do anything with any women there, even though i have no reason to say this. After he leaves, I think I hear someone breaking into the apartment, so I call him home to check. After finding out it was just our dog, he thinks I tricked him into coming home and leaves again in a bad mood.
