input: My boyfriend (well just call him M) and I are creators on Instagram (he is also on TikTok). I'm a digital and traditional artist and in one of my classes we create t shirts and things (socks, lanyards, water bottles, stickers, you name it). I'm a big fan of putting my art on t shirts so I can sell them.

M wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

Am I the asshole for wanting to wear the shirt I made just once?

Now complete the following example-
input: So here's the rundown. I'm currents in the midst of my first year at college, and I live in a suite style room. So for reference this is a shared common space with a bunch of other room which can be either single or double. So I'm pretty good friends with 5 of my 6 suite-mates, and we all want to live together next year is the same situation.  The other guy is just very shy and doesn't come out much. So, fast forward a bit I meet my friend in question, let's call him Tyler. So Tyler is a good guy, but he can be a little much at times. It seems like he has really high standards for what is clean and what isn't. For context, I'm extremely messy, so that's one thing I thought would be a little much for Tyler. Tyler also isn't the most agreeable guy at times which in small doses doesn't bother me very much, but can get annoying at times. My suite mates echo this sentiment as well. So we decided it would be best that, we not live with Tyler for fear of his idiosyncrasies causing resentment between us and him. Tyler has been struggling recently with some outside factors, and though he hasn't explicitly stated it I'm sure he has some other mental issues as well. In short he's had a pretty hard life and bares the scars at times. 

  

So about 3 weeks ago one of the members of my suite mates and Tyler had a mini falling out, and we thought he hated us for a while. So we went ahead and asked another guy who we knew pretty well if he wanted to room with us. He said yes, and that was it. I tried really hard to reconnect with Tyler and eventually did. He started hanging out in our suite again and everything was back to normal. Fast forward about a week and Tyler texted my suite mate, if he still needed another guy in the suite. He told him that we already found someone else, and Tyler was fuming. Since then he hasn't talked to any of us. I even see him in the halls, and he ignores me. If he seems me taking the stairs, he'll take the elevator to avoid me. I still want to be friends with Tyler just not his roommate. If you need any additional context just ask in the comments, and I'd be more than happy to respond. I just want to get this whole situation sorted out.

input: He's always walking around the house without a shirt. My friends have been sleeping over during the weekend and he still didn't wear a shirt. Me and my friends were talking about it and then the conversation changes to my dad being hot (he's not, he's not even that muscular and just has a ball of muscle instead of actual abs, his beard is also not even groomed properly but anyway.) I was just so grossed out so earlier today I told my dad to put a shirt on. He just laughed it off and treated it like a joke. I told him like five times. Then, I told my mom to tell him and she yelled at me saying that I can't tell my parents what to do. I even told both of them about what happened. I've been extremely persistent with it. My mom kinda cussed me out and said I was being rude. But, you guys, am I missing something? Because I don't feel like an asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: This is a long one, so be prepared.  A bit of background..... My wife and I got married pretty young. We both belonged to a very conservative religion where that was normal.  But sexual repression was also a part of the religion, and thus we were both pretty in the dark as to what our sexual needs were/ had some serious guilt complexes about some ""experimenting"" we did while we were dating.  The first couple years of our marriage were pretty rocky, with both of us doing some things that although most people wouldn't consider infidelity, definitely damaged our marriage (I had a problem with porn, she drunkenly experimented with another girl).  

We both avoided the discussion we should have had for a long time, but we eventually had some serious talks.  We both knew rebuilding trust was going to be a huge issue, but decided we were going to try to make things work.  

Shortly after that, she told me that her depression was pretty bad and that her PTSD had been pretty unbearable (she experienced sexual abuse), and she told me she would like to move closer to her parents, partially for support and partially because they have health problems that would require someone to care for them eventually anyway.   I agreed to the move, and began slowly preparing.  Then she calls me a few weeks later crying, telling me that she quit her job because her co-workers were treating her badly, and her manager was siding with them.  I told her it was ok, and assured her I wasn't mad.  She asked if we could just rush the move, since we were planning to anyway, and just stay with her parents for a month or two while we got things in order.  Against my better judgement I agreed, and within a week we were there. 

Well both got jobs right away, and everything was going ok.  But right before we were going to move into the place we had found, a serious health emergency caused me to have to leave work for a couple months, setting us back a bit.  We were starting to get back into a good position when we found out she was pregnant.  This was a complete surprise, because she had been told that she would probably never be able to have kids. I didn't know quite how to feel, but I supported her through the whole thing.  Facing the prospect of so much added expense kind of delayed our plans to move though, so we put life on hold for a bit.
  Eventually she approached me with the idea of buying a house with her parents, since she would inevitably be caring for them eventually anyway, and them splitting expenses with us so it wouldn't be so hard on us or them.  Again, against my better judgement I agreed (I really just wanted her to be happy, and I was ok doing whatever would achieve that goal.  So we did, and our baby was born shortly after.  

Things were ok for the first few months, and although we had a few arguments I thought things were ok.  But a few days after our anniversary I found out she had been talking to some other (married) guy.  I found it because she left her phone at home and when I picked it up I saw the messages.  I confronted her, and she admitted it.  She swore it hadn't been going on long, and that they had never been intimate.  But then she started blaming me, saying she was lonely, and that's why she turned to someone else.  I reminded her that I had spent our entire anniversary day (only a few days before) trying to talk to her, and she lied and said that her friend was having some kind of crisis and needed her, when the reality was that she was ignoring me for this guy.  

  At first after this I tried to fix things, and she told me she would cut all contact with the guy.  But she then started saying that she wasn't happy, and that she couldn't let the problems we had in the past go.  She bounced back and forth between wanting to end things and wanting to try and repair things, and since we now had a child I patiently waited, hoping we could fix it.  But eventually it came out that she never even cut contact with the guy, and that a week or so later HE told HER he wanted to cut contact and try to fix his marriage. 

 We were still living together at this point, since we had her parents living with us.  But she said she wanted to just end things.  At this point I  agreed with her completely, and we decided we would just slowly figure stuff out, and separate when we had everything in order.  Later, come to find out, she had been seeing another married guy during this time, and although I wasn't horribly upset, when she told me and asked me if I had been, I told her ""no, I have enough respect for you to at least wait until we aren't living together before I do that"". It's one of the few times I said something pretty hurtful, and it definitely made my point.  She confessed that she felt like an awful person, and I just kind of told her honestly that I thought her breaking up two marriages and two families just to have what she wanted was pretty shitty.   

 We are finally at the tail end of the whole thing, her parents resent her for forcing them to move (she can't afford the house on her own, even with their help, and neither can I) and for basically making a promise to help take care of them that she's now going back on.   And for my part, I'm just angry that she took so long to decide she didn't want this, and couldn't let the past go.  Was I a perfect husband..... Not by a long shot!  We both fucked up, and agreed to put that behind us.  I resent her, not for wanting a divorce, but for putting me, her parents, and our child in this situation, and waiting until the point that she did to decide she didn't want to be together.   AITA for holding resentment when I damaged our marriage too?

input: My husband and I have been together for 17 years or so, married 12-both 41. His family is in another state so I only spend time with my MIL for maybe two weeks out of a year. She is an amazing person, so warm and caring and considerate-I’m very lucky. He comes from a religious very family oriented situation, while I grew up in a very fractured dysfunctional family, never talk about your feelings or anything real. My MIL has always tried to connect with me via emails and phone calls, and always says ‘love you’ at the end of our interactions. 

I appreciate this and it means a lot to me, but I can’t say it back and I feel shitty about it. I don’t say that easily, because I need to really mean it in my bones if I do. I’ve had some fairly traumatic situations with two different stepfathers and though I know an in law isn’t the same, it does still feel a bit like having family foisted on me again that I didn’t choose. I logically understand that by choosing to get married, I’m now part of his family, but due to my crazy past that just doesn’t mean as much to me as I wish it did. I’m kind to my MIL, I thank her for kindnesses and do my best to connect with her, but I just can’t bring myself to say ‘love you’. 

I’m not even sure I don’t, I just don’t feel comfortable saying it. But-i know it would make her so happy and it’s just a few words that aren’t completely untrue. Should I just say it back? AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: So my neighbor is having a yardsale and he inherited a bunch of antiques from his dead parents. I never really liked this guy as he catcalls my girlfriend and makes rude comments about my other neighbors and is constantly blasting loud music in the middle of the night keeping us up even after us repeatedly telling him to stop. We've frankly had enough with him. In his yardsale i see a couple of 1944 wheat pennies in almost mint condition in plastic protection containers and 2 1870 3 cent nickels also in fairly good condition. Total combined value is around 300-500 dollars but I'm not exactly sure as I'm not too familiar with these types of coins and it could possibly be worth in the thousands.  I will check it out at a coin star soon.He sold me these coins for 30 bucks and i heard him whispering to his friends how he just ripped off a dumbass. He also has a bunch of ration card booklets from WW2 which he sold to me for a few dollars. I have absolutely no idea how valuable these are but its sure as hell worth a lot more than a few dollars. He also sold me a 1940 M1 garand (rifle) that he inherited from his grandfather for only  200 USD and honestly it's probably worth at least 3000 according to listings I've seen online for it.. This whole time he and his friends are snickering and whispering about how much I'm getting ripped off. I just ignore it. All my buddies think this is hilarious and they love using my gun and are really envious about my coins. I get a week later from my neighbor basically telling me how i ripped him off and i need to pay him more money or return the items. I tell him to fuck off. His uncle is furious at him because of how badly he was ripped off and he wanted to get the M1 garand. His uncle nonstop calls me demanding i give him the M1 and i also tell him to fuck off. My neighbor tells me he'll get the attorney involved and i tell him to stop being immature and that he was a jackass for selling these at such a low price. I also remind him of the catcalling and the partying and i basically tell all his other family members about his comments and they start to turn on him.

input: Hi,
This is an odd one but I just want to make sure I'm not overstepping by doing this.

So recently, I (M) asked a girl I have been talking to out on a date. She was quite excited about it and we have arranged to go this saturday night. I am quite excited about it as well, as she seems like an amazing person.

However, last night, I was talking with another female friend who went out with one of my friends, and she has been quite down after some events happening between them. She feels 'used' by him, and after hearing he might be getting back in with his ex, was quite upset by it. I said I'll try to meet up with her (before my date) and just make sure she is doing well, but I'm worried that by doing this, it would be really disrespectful to the girl I asked out. So, WIBTA for going out with this girl to make sure shes doing alright, after having asked the other girl on a date? Should I possibly mention it to the girl just so she understands why I'm going to meet her and doesn't take it the wrong way?

input: My best man dropped out of my wedding a month ago. I haven't spoked to him since. Am I being an asshole or am I justified?

Background: I've always been closer to my friends than my family. My brother died young, and that tragedy really split up my family. Only living family I have (my mom) is basically estranged from me. My friends are my family and I'm okay with that. Maybe that's why this bothers me so much.

Friend (32m) and I grew up together. We met in elementary school, became best friends and have stayed in touch ever since. I was in his wedding two years ago. That wedding was in Australia and it was a pretty big commitment to go. I took a week off of work, blew a ton of money on flights and then spent 40 miserable hours on an economy flight to the other side of the damn planet. But I didn't complain because like I said, friends are my family. 

Friend isn't coming to my wedding in six months. His reason? He doesn't want to upset his boss. Friend would be missing either a Friday or a Monday to attend my wedding because he lives in another state. Friend's boss says it's a really busy time for the business. Friend didn't ask twice. Friend didn't try to arrange coverage or hand off work to someone else. Friend did not try to book a red eye flight or arrange different travel plans. Friend just texted me to say he can't make it.  
My soon-to-be wife says I'm not being an asshole because this is one of the biggest days of our lives. A different friend says I'm being dramatic because ""it's just a big expensive party."" I feel betrayed and sick to my stomach about the whole thing. To me, this is incredibly important. If Friend can't be bothered to make it out on one of the most important days for me then he's not my friend anymore.

input: Background, I am on a semi-vacation/job hunt in California. We were given free tickets to a comedy show. It's not my first choice and since the show were before we wanted to go out I accepted.
The comedian is apparently somewhat famous but I've ever heard of him. Anyways he kicked off the show talking his friends Aziz Ansari and Louis CK. I was like whoa...bold move and I was seriously taken aback and pretty defensive.


 He told more jokes and I didn't laugh once. He then said somthing about ""#movement (auto mod didn't like this term ) has run its course!"" I couldn't help myself so I yelled out somthing like ""that subject is never funny."" He stopped in his tracks and called for the door  men to walk me out and that he wasn't messing around because he was sick or something.

The manager met me outside and said that I was kicked out but he's comp our drinks which made me feel good until he started chewing me out like a little kid that stand up is an ""art"" and it's the ""height of asshole"" to heckle a set. He said I was on a two week ban. Really...ok.


But am I the asshole here?

Positive example 1-
input: My boyfriend (well just call him M) and I are creators on Instagram (he is also on TikTok). I'm a digital and traditional artist and in one of my classes we create t shirts and things (socks, lanyards, water bottles, stickers, you name it). I'm a big fan of putting my art on t shirts so I can sell them.

M wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

Am I the asshole for wanting to wear the shirt I made just once?
output: wanting to wear a shirt
Positive example 2-
input: Pretty much was hanging out with two friends. I was watching the Lakers game. They won at the very last minute and I immediately hopped up and celebrated. Before I could even finish celebrating one friend started going on about how the Lakers suck. It just pissed me off so much I screamed at her to get out my room until she left. 


She knows I'm a huge fan and she likes them too. She was only saying it to antagonize me. Am I the dick here?

Now complete the following example-
input: I (27F) was invited to a bridal shower for a woman who is marrying my boyfriends cousin. My boyfriend (27M) is not close to this cousin and we are actually unsure we are even going to be able to attend the wedding (out of town trip already planned for that weekend).  My boyfriends Mom(50s) and sister(29) were also invited. 

The date of the bridal shower is the day I was planning some birthday festivities for my close friend. I have met this woman only once at a party. I assume she was probably inviting everyone that’s invited to the wedding as well. I just have no desire to sit there and watch someone open presents for hours, play games, and not to mention I’d have to purchase a gift and we are currently in intense savings mode for a house. I had talked to my boyfriend about skipping and he said it was no big deal, and that it would be fine to skip. But then I talked to my Mom...and as Moms do best, she planted seeds of doubt. 

My mom thinks it would be a good opportunity to get closer to my boyfriends Mom and sister and have some bonding time. (We have been dating for over 2 years so I know them pretty well I think) Whenever we see his family, we are all cordial but I just don’t see any real connections happening with his Mom and sister unfortunately. They are both deeply into Catholicism and don’t really drink or swear. I am an atheist and love me some fucking booze. We just don’t seem to have too much common ground. My boyfriend is also pretty removed from them (if given the choice he’d rather hang out with my family) So I’d say we get along with them but we don’t share a closeness. Some of you may say this may be an opportunity to open the door to closeness but I feel if closeness was going to happen it probably would have by now. If I really wanted to, I could switch around some birthday festivities to accommodate this but idk AITA for wanting to skip out on this shower?
