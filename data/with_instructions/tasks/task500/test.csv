input: My boyfriend (well just call him M) and I are creators on Instagram (he is also on TikTok). I'm a digital and traditional artist and in one of my classes we create t shirts and things (socks, lanyards, water bottles, stickers, you name it). I'm a big fan of putting my art on t shirts so I can sell them.

M wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

Am I the asshole for wanting to wear the shirt I made just once?

Mine disc reader hasn't broken yet for some reason his has etc.) So I want to give him mine and replace the one I'm giving him with a newer model. AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm asking because I genuinely have no idea whether I'm doing the right thing. 

My sister has mental health issues that are particularly ill at evening and night-time. I've been there for her for months, but tonight I just didn't have the energy. She has called me a few times tonight and flat-out asked if I can come over to help, but for the first time, I have said I need some rest and to get some work done.

I've moved back home with my parents to help her, and she lives in her own apartment in the same building. There are only two people that calm her down (to some extent), and that is me and my brother. My brother can't be there for her because he is going through a lot too, and is battling his own mind.

She is in treatment 3 times every week, but it hasn't helped. She has been severely depressed for over 10 years, and it only continues to get worse.

A normal night will start with us playing games, but she will gradually become hysterical. This happens every single night. She begins with becoming hyper, then hysterical, and then become delirious. A regular night involves self-harming in front of me, running outside to hurt herself, locking herself into the bathroom with medicines or a knife, being aggressive and violent towards me, crying hysterically and over-eating. It's clear that she is just looking for an outlet. She feels so hysterical and desperate, but nothing seems to give her peace... 

I don't know what to do, but I have no more energy. It just doesn't get better, and I think she needs professional help. The doctors believe she is in the right treatment, but I can't see any improvement. I'm certain she will hurt herself tonight while I'm gone, and worried she will do something worse. I don't know what to do, but I have nothing more to give.   


Still, it makes me feel like an asshole to not be there for her even though she is suicidal, should I pull myself together and go another mile? I can hear her crying hysterically through the wall, but I'm just sitting here enjoying a few hours of my own company.

Now complete the following example-
input: My ex and I dated a long time (like 7 years) and then my ex broke up with me unexpectedly. I was upset during it but we remained friends after still.

Sometime later my ex wanted to get back with me but I didn't really want to, but being friends was ok, sometimes my ex would push boundaries a bit and I'd not stop them but overall it wasn't attention I wanted. I think I mostly remained friends because of how long we were together and felt like removing each other from our lives would be difficult and we liked being friends overall. 

Well sometime last year I got a new partner and my partner had me remove bad influences from my life that I desperately needed to do, one of who was my ex. I completely ghosted my ex and despite my ex trying to contact me asking what's wrong, am I okay, how they wanted to remain friends with me cause I'm important to them, I never did respond.

Sometimes I consider messaging the ex and explaining why I ghosted them, but at the same time it's been about a year since it all happened, been about 4 years since they've broken up with me. Should I just leave it in the past, given how long it's been? My ex has still tried to talk to me through family so I know they're not over it completely still. 

The main reason I cut them out is because they were emotionally abusive towards me at times though it was mostly because their mental health wasn't good and I was always willing to bend over backwards for them no matter what. There was one time when we were both drunk that they got physical towards me but nothing other than that incident aside from yelling at me and it always came down to it being my fault, gray area for who's it actually was. 

WIBTA if I contacted them again? I don't actually want to keep talking to them but everyone says ghosting is bad so it makes me feel worse knowing I did it to not just them, but others as well. Most of who I cut out were people my current partner said were manipulating me which is true, I was put in many uncomfortable situations that I didn't know exactly how to get out of and figured that's how life is for me and dealt with it rather than making it stop. 

Tldr, WIBTA if I contacted my ex to explain why I ghosted?

Now complete the following example-
input: I work at a place on the overnight shift. There are a few people at this place that honestly should have been fired years ago. A little information, I work at a place that has two separate buildings. I am in the second building and this person called Joe is in the first building. I've been warned about how lazy Joe is, and I've seen some of it. 
So tonight I get in at midnight and check in at the front desk to be logged in. I see he is asleep at the front desk. (for overnight shifts, sometimes people sleep but  not until 3 or 4 when all the work is done). I go to my spot in the second building. 
Around one in the morning I am told I had to get something for someone in the first building. The second person in the main building is older and can't go up and down steps well. the materials I had to get were downstairs. I go into the drawer next to joe, grab the keys and get the stuff. Im irritated at this point. Why was I called over when he was just as capable of doing this? He was awake at this point, I would like to add, and watching something on his laptop. 
I go back upstairs after locking up and put the keys in the drawer and look him in the face and calmly say, ""If someone else needs this item, you need to get it. I'm not walking back and forth between buildings like this all night."" He looks at me as though I just cussed him out. 
""Who do you think you're talking to?"" He yells. I walk out, not wanting to have started an argument. I thought he was just going to shrug it off and ignore me like he usually does to people. He keeps calling after me like that until im outside. I walk back to the second building and see my friend/coworker in her car and stop to talk to her and tell her how frustrated I was. She thought it was funny and was glad I told him that. Until he comes over.
He rushes me, screaming ""who do you think you are? you don't talk to me like that, don't disrespect me like that, you don't yell at me and slam them keys."" I calmly tell him he needs to calm down and he doesn't get to talk to me like this. He continues going on and on and screaming at me about he wasn't the one who called me over. Which I knew but I don't understand why the person sitting right next to him, never told him to do it, but called me over. 
Im now shaking and on edge. I was scared. I didn't know what the hell was going to happen and I'm scared to be alone with him especially off camera. I emailed my boss and the person in charge of this section of the organization. At first I felt justified, but now I am scared that maybe I was in the wrong. I never slammed the keys, and I never rose my voice, even when he was screaming at me. My coworker told me to tell my boss what happened. He has no business talking to me like that. I didn't mean to start a fight. Am I the asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: About a week ago, my aunt and uncle took me to Hawaii as a little surprise vacation to celebrate my acceptance into nursing school (yay!). My uncle is an investor while my aunt owns her own bridal salon; needless to say, they’re pretty well off. And while they spared no expense for the trip, I didn’t want them paying for anything I brought back because Hawaii was amazing enough (I had to *reeally* fight them on this too).

I spent a little over $300 in total on gifts. On the last day of the trip, my mom called and asked me to buy gifts for three of my cousins because their mom had given us gift cards this year. We normally don’t celebrate xmas/exchange gifts with them, so it caught me off guard a bit. Nonetheless, I walked down to the ABC store and started looking.

My aunt had shown me another ABC outside of the hotel earlier on because they had better deals, so I decided to walk over and check it out. Low and behold, they had a magnificent 5/$20 shirt deal going on. I was also able to get 2 additional shirts for my other cousins (whom I’m very close with), so it was a win-win in my head. I even had them all pick the shirts out themselves through FaceTime to make sure they liked and would fit in them.

Fast forward to the day I get home, and my mom is fuming with anger when she finds out what I got them. She said I was cheap and selfish to spend so little on them (they gave us $20 Starbucks gift cards) and compared them to the $11 shirts I had bought for my siblings (I got them from the hotel ABC store prior to finding that wonderful 5/$20 deal at the street ABC). Then she decided that she was just going to buy entirely different gifts for them herself.

I would’ve never guessed my mom would get so worked up over something like this. For starters, she doesn’t like that aunt *at all*. Neither does most of my family (some decades-long drama), but I like my cousins just fine. I’m just not close with them, so I wasn’t planning on spending a whole lot on them. I probably should’ve gotten them an additional souvenir or something just because of the $20 vs $4 disparity, but I don’t think the shirts are a bad gift... heck, I would’ve got one for myself if I hadn’t already spent so much. I’m going to give them the shirts anyways just because I already got them, but I wanted to know if it really was an asshole move on my part?

A put their new name in thier bio on thier art and vent account on Instagram (which was the main way I talked to them). They even made a post saying 'the next person who calls me (dead name) gets fucking shot. Like seriously, stop.' 
So I started correcting people when they called A by thier dead name. It really seemed like they didn't want to be called thier dead name, and I didn't want to cause any distress to them. 
Yesterday A comes up to me and asks why I told my friend they were nb. They basically never talk to me irl, so I got taken aback. I said 'I didn't know you didn't want me to tell people' and I receive a text later telling me that me and them shouldn't be friends

Now complete the following example-
input: Context; we're both just about 16, (our birthdays are in early December) so obviously neither of us can drive and he cant medically advocate for himself in our state (NY). We've been together for 3 years (4 in January), so this isnt a new family member. 

Yesterday afternoon he was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (the hereditary one, you're born with it but sometimes it only manifests later in life) and we spent 7 hours in total between travel and the hospital due to things moving slowly; 30 minutes being tossed around between the clinic and ER, 40 minutes until he could get a blood draw, an hour and a half for the results of said blood draw, 2 hours for the ambulance transport to arrive so he could be transferred to a bigger hospital, etc. He's being admitted for a couple days and hopefully will be released tomorrow after an educator comes in to teach him how to manage his condition, but the doctor said it could be up to a week if figuring out an insulin regimen doesnt go smoothly. 

His mother is nearly illiterate, and he doesn't have a father in the picture or any other family member capable of staying with them for her sake. He's plenty smart enough to handle it himself, but information doesn't go to him much since he's a minor. Another concern is that they live below the $20k income line and if Medicaid/catastrophic health insurance doesn't cover something there's no way they'll be able to pay for it on their own. 

I want to go up and bring him his phone charger, own pajamas and the book we have to finish reading for a class. Plus I just see him for a bit to make sure everything is alright with his treatment. Problem is, I need someone to take me and my mother refuses until after dinner at noon. The hospital is a 1-2 hour ride and she isnt willing to drive that much for me or him because my college freshman brother is home for Thanksgiving and he's the golden child, which is what it is. 

In the middle of writing this my grandma just showed up, just about told my mom to go fuck herself, and we're off like a prom dress. 
Now the issue is that my mom is going to be pissed once I get back for ""ruining her thanksgiving"", but I dont care.

Now complete the following example-
input: We’re all seniors in high school. i have these two friends who i love with literally all my heart. i’ve known the girl since elementary and the guy since my sophomore year of high school. they both were there for me during some really traumatic stuff in my family. when i introduced them to each other, i always saw them as a cute couple, so when they both came to me individually &amp; said they were interested in each other, i was pretty excited. it’s just that for at least 3 months both of them wouldn’t tell the other person how they felt. even though it was obvious. because of their lack of communication, both their (mostly her’s) insecurities got the best of them. she’d get upset when he’d hang out with girls and she wasn’t with him, she even accused me of having a thing with me. i have a boyfriend so she basically accused me of cheating on my boyfriend with the guy i set her up with. basically, those three months of them being ‘in like’ &amp; not telling each other was just pure hell for me. they were just so annoying 

finally, they went out officially and are now in a relationship. they’re not fighting as much and it’s actually fun being around them when they’re together. until yesterday when she said something that i don’t want to hear coming from the girlfriend of someone i care about. i love them both and that’s why i want them to both be treated correctly. i’m not going to pick sides but whenever they fought &amp; came to me for advice, i always told them the truth, even if it wasn’t what they wanted to hear. 

yesterday she said that he doesn’t treat her good and that she knows her worth and that she wants to break it off. i asked her to elaborate but she refused. i know him pretty well but i also understand that people can change when they’re in a relationship and i don’t know what happens behind closed doors so i didn’t push her. i told her that she should break it off if she wasn’t into it anymore. but then she said “his grades are going to sink and i want to go to prom. i’ll just break up with him a couple weeks before or after graduation”. that fucking pissed me off. his grades were fine before they dated, and they’re not any different. it seems like she has no respect for him because she always bad mouths him in front of people he’s not close with but then is all sweet when they’re together.  basically, would i be the asshole if i told him this? or should i just keep my mouth shut?

Now complete the following example-
input: So today, my roommate felt that it was necessary to open the window while it is 7 degrees Fahrenheit outside. I said it was already cold and that I'm not having the window open when its 7 degrees outside. He said that it was so hot in our room that his ears were burning and that it was at least 82 degrees. He went to open the window and I raised my voice and said that I am not having 7 degree air enter our room, and that if he felt feel like he was hot, he needs change out of his long sleeve clothing. I stopped him from opening the window, and we begrudgingly agreed to open the window about a centimeter. 

&amp;#x200B;

Afterwards, he began sarcastically remarking about how sorry he was that he disagreed with me. Example sentence:

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm so sorry I disagreed with such a godly man. You're clearly always right, I'm so sorry.""

&amp;#x200B;

I then got angry and said he was drunk if he thought it was hot in here, reminded him that nobody else thinks it's hot, and said he should go to the doctor for a fever. It was seven fucking degrees outside and there was no way in hell that window was opening more than a crack.

&amp;#x200B;

He then remained angry for about 20 minutes, constantly reminding me about how salty and angry I was about it (I already got over it considering that the window was hardly open, I have no idea what he was talking about).

I told him that he was acting like a victim and that he should grow up. I reminded him that it was 7 degrees outside and that I wasn't having the window opened.

&amp;#x200B;

To top it off, he afterwards asked me if I was going to stab him at night, and that it seemed like something I would do.

In the past, I've gotten slightly physical (a push) when he, for the 9th time that day, went to open the blinds that let the sunlight glare on my computer screen, I lost patience with him wanting to sacrifice the ability for me to use my computer because our room's ceiling light wasn't good enough for him.

&amp;#x200B;

Afterwards, a friend came into my room asking for the temperature outside, and I said:

&amp;#x200B;

""It's seven degrees outside. Ya wanna know how I know? Cause \[Roommate\] wanted to open the fucking window.""

&amp;#x200B;

AITA?

input: Me [M19] and my girlfriend [F19] have this thing we do where we pick out different move series that we watch in case we have nothing planned for the days that we hang out. Harry Potter is our 3rd movie series that we decided to watch because I had never seen the Harry Potter movies and she had seen them multiple times because it’s one of her favorites. Before that I chose the Lord of the Rings series because she hadn’t seen that one and it’s one of my favorites . Sometimes we have to cut our movie time short because one of us had to go back to our house or it was time for bed (if one of us are sleeping over) well the other day we had to cut “The order of the Phoenix” short, about 45 minutes before it ended because she had to go back to her house and we wouldn’t see each other for a couple days later. Well the day after our movie time I was bored because it was my day off (were college students and I work a part time job) and I almost never have a lot of spare time. I decided to watch the last 45 minutes of the movie and I have to say it was pretty good. When I told her I finished the movie she seemed pretty upset, we didn’t fight or anything and there was no yelling or tears involved but she still looked pretty upset. And she had done  the same thing before when we watched the Lord of the Rings series on the Two Towers movie so I didn’t think it was a big deal and didn’t care that she did it. I told her this but I still feel bad about the whole thing. Am I the ass?

TL:DR: me and my gf watch different movie series with each other and I finished a movie without her.

Now complete the following example-
input: Some backstory:

* I am my mom's only child (my dad has three other daughters he does not talk to much),
* I am stationed overseas with my husband for one more year and then we are stationed back into the states,
* it has been a year and a half since I have seen them (the last time I saw them, I flew from overseas to the states).

So recently, my parents have been very adamant about my coming to visit them this year. However, I am getting very tired of it and want to be straightforward with them. It isn't about the cost of the ticket.

It's about the time it takes for me to get home, seeing as they live in a small town far from a main airport. It's also about the fact that they would push for me to stay for two weeks or more. This goes against my current schedule in college and my gym time (though that is flexible rather than college). When they do bring up my flying to visit them, I bring up these issues and they say it will be fine, but that I really should stay 2+ weeks.

Would I be the asshole if I told my parents I don't want to visit them until next year, when I am back in the states? Is there a better way to word this? Do I have to be very straightforward with them?

I put my reverse lights on to back up and they still were standing right next to my car, and the cart was over the line a bit and I didn't want to risk hitting it or them. So, I opened the door to ask if they could move their cart up a bit and said thanks when they did, and the lady yelled at me ""Jesus. We are just trying to pack our car."" I said to them I was just trying to reverse and not hit them, but they continued to point at me and around after I closed the door. I think maybe they took it as me being angry that they were next to my car instead of me trying to hit them, but am I the asshole for asking them to move?

Now complete the following example-
input: Over the years I've gotten closer to my coworker as we both progressed through our careers. She is extremely smart and always willing to help whenever I was ""stuck"", so I built up a dependency on her as we progressed together. Late last year we began meeting on the weekends to play tennis as she was always looking for a partner to play with, and we'd go to lunch afterwards and just generally hang out; that is when I started developing feelings for her and wanting to see her more. I didn't want to complicate our close work relationship; but I couldn't control how I felt, either.

I decided to stop being so available since I wanted these feelings to go away, but she kept persisting asking if everything was okay. I finally decided that I needed to know where she stood but ultimately found out that the feelings were not reciprocated :(. In a sense I felt a lot of relief because it meant I could move away from this emotional attachment I had towards her, but I also wanted some real distance away in all aspects (ie. weekend meets, work emails/messages, text, etc.) to facilitate that removal. She wanted to continue the friendship and tried in the beginning to talk like nothing happened, but it was sometimes difficult for me since the feelings lingered, so I ultimately stopped responding in the supporting way that she was used to. That caused a snowball effect where she stopped responding as well and it has now deteriorated our once close friendship to now of just purely coworkers who talk only about work and only when necessary. We no longer just ""check in"" to see how the other is doing, and any conversation lacks the emotional depth and support it once had. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still think she has a heart of gold and is an overall great person, but towards me she is cold and indifferent and I probably deserve that in someway for causing all this in the first place. I never told her I wanted the distance since she seemed really persistent in not talking about my feelings, so I just never got the chance to explain my perspective. AITA for abandoning a once great relationship to get over my own emotional attachment?

Now complete the following example-
input: So my husband and I had a rough year. He cheated, i caught him, we tried to work through it but it blew up so we separated and went to see counselors and have worked through everything. 

So before all of that happened my husband and i had been getting really close with one of my husbands coworkers and his wife and family. We hung out a lot, at least once a week and we texted every day. We would have them over for holidays and even if my husband was working I'd go hang out with them without him. 

Me and his coworker really became good friends more than me and his wife because we had a lot in common and the main thing was we had the same sense of humor. A kind of raunchy humor and we would send each other funny videos or memes all the time. 

But they were really like family. If we needed advice, we'd go to them. If they needed anything they could come to us. 

So when I caught my husband cheating I was devastated. I went to them and confided a lot in them. As my husband and I tried to work through it they were there for us helping us both with all the things we were feeling. But when it all blew up and we separated they immediately boxed me out. It was radio silence. I reached out to them and nothing. They never answered the phone or called back or replied to my texts. They were my only friends so I was completely alone. They never once were there for me.

So after me and my husband started to figure things out and started living together again they invited my husband to a bar/restaurant. I said I wasn't ready to see them again so I stayed home. When he got there they started begging him to invite me. I said no but I was trying to put my best foot forward for my husband and I eventually caved and went. 

I was not very nice. I basically gave them the cold shoulder. They asked how I was doing and I said I was doing fine on my own. And then they got defensive. He(coworker) said the reason they picked my husbands side was because they work together. And then he told me to stop being mad because I was just looking for things to be mad about. I ignored this and left.

After that he(coworker) started spamming me with funny videos and memes. Not any real conversation just memes. I'd say lol or funny but I eventually stopped replying altogether. 

It went on for a bit but I got tired of all these raunchy videos. So I told him that I was sorry I was rude the day at the restaurant but if he thought of me as just his coworkers wife, then he shouldn't be sending me those things anymore. I told him he was my best friend and I had confided a lot in him and I felt abandoned when he and his wife stopped talking to me.

His reply was ""it didnt have to be like this but if that's how you want it to be fine. All you have to do is apologize and we can fix our friendship.""

I didnt text back. I dont know what else to apologize for. I've asked my husband and he doesnt know either. Am I being an asshole? Am I missing something. I miss their friendship every day but I feel like they aren't good friends. Am I crazy?

input: My husband and I lived in a mobile home/RV park for 3 years. We recently bought a house about 2 hours up the road. The neighbor, who live in an RV next to us, wants to buy our RV and pay with personal check. 

We are so ready to get rid of that thing because lot rent, utilities, and homeowners insurance is eating us alive. Which is why I don't want to make him mad by implying his check might not be good and have him pull out of the deal. He's a nice and honest person. Not a stranger. He's been living there longer than us. 

Would I be the asshole if I tell him he has to pay with a cashier's check?

Now complete the following example-
input: First and foremost, I'm twenty-three. My mom has had severe depression to the point where it's a genuine illness for years, and she also likely has an undiagnosed behavioral disorder (based on professional opinions from doctors). Additionally, she had a stroke a couple of years ago, which further messed with her emotions and sullied her judgement. She's a very good person, and I love her very much. We have a pretty great relationship, and usually spend about an hour or two a week talking on the phone. She's one of the few people in the world I actually seek out time with.

That being said, since I graduated high school at nineteen and therefore no longer needed her for parenting purposes, she's continued to parent me, and she treats me as though I were about sixteen or seventeen (that is to say, not needing to monitor my whereabouts constantly but still parenting me in other ways). I've been moved out with a job for several years now. My dad, who is mentally sound, has treated me like an adult for the most part since I hit eighteen, with some exceptions since I was still living with them, and once I graduated, he considered me a full-fledged adult. My mom was pretty much emotionally absent during my teenage years, and my dad believes that she is now trying to ""make up for it"" by parenting me and ""behaving like a family"". He lets me divulge information as I'm comfortable with doing so, and doesn't ask for more information than is needed. My mom, however, demands information. For example, recently, my doctor insisted I quit my job immediately for medical reasons, and so I did. I was very upset about this, of course. My parents and I trade the car back and forth, and I told my dad that he could have the car for a bit while I figured some stuff out. He was fine with this, and just said okay, for which I was grateful because I didn't want to talk about it. My mom was confused and asked why, saying she didn't understand what was going on. She asked my dad if I'd told him anything. He said no. She asked if he thought to probe about it. He said no, that I'm an adult and will tell him if I so choose. She got upset with my dad (they're going through a divorce and she is always mad at him), said that wasn't how family behaved, and called me, asking what was going on. I reluctantly explained, and she started lecturing me. I told her very firmly that I love her very much and I know she's speaking because she loves me, but that I am not a child anymore, and that as an adult, I am allowed to set boundaries, and that she is crossing them, and to please stop parenting me. She got very upset about this. Please note that this is just once instance of many. We haven't talked about it since then.

I still wonder if I did the right thing. My dad thinks I did, and said ""good for you!"" when I told him about it. I don't know, though. What do you think? AITA?

input: So context to the story is several college friends of mine were eating together and one, who is a special education major, was telling us how it was offensive to refer to an epileptic person as an ""epileptic person"" rather than a ""person with epilepsy"" as the former is defining a person by their disability. I didn't think the slight change in semantics was really much of a difference and felt like both phrases had just about the same connotation, neither of which was negative. I said both ways of describing someone with epilepsy were basically the same thing and I didn't think someone with epilepsy would really be offended by being called an epileptic person as long as it was relevant to the sentence. I didn't think much of what I said but she was extremely upset I disagreed with her and has been telling everyone we had a huge falling out. She didn't actually respond to what I said, and I didn't think anything of it until later when I found out she thought of it as a ""huge falling out"" so am I wrong to describe people with epilepsy as ""epileptic people""?

For context, I’m 17M she’s 16F. I am currently being diagnosed for gender identity disorder, but I’m still into girls. She has no idea about any of this and really just assumes I’m normal. My current situation lies in which I feel like I’m lying to her by keeping the real me hidden. She never asked, and I don’t really want many people in my life knowing about this.

We’ve been dating for around 6 months now, and it’s really going well. We have been friends for about 3 years at this point, and I’m glad we’ve moved on to this stage. It’s her first relationship and both of us have been much happier after we started dating.

She fell in love with the person I am not, and I’m too afraid to just break her heart and just end the relationship without any reason, or at least for her it won’t have any reason. Am I doing the right thing of keeping it going or am I being selfish and keeping it cause I also love her?

input: AITA: As the title suggests I do not want to pay for tickets on a car that was neither in my name or possession. My grandma gave me a car when she passed. They put it in my mom's name. My mom would not let me put it in my name.

 Fast forward to me moving out. I could not garage the vehicle at my new place so, per an agreement, I left it at my mom's. The car is registered in her name and I assume her address. We had agreed to leave the car there since there is plenty of parking. There is street sweeping on her street so the car was required to be moved by law. I did not have a key to the car and it is not in my name. She was supposed to move it on the days posted on the street signs. 

My mom did not move the vehicle. It gathered tickets. My mom then took my sister and her boyfriend to South Africa on a vacation. They left the car there and she had the keys. I recognized that the car would be ticketed so I called AAA to unlock the car so I could put it in neutral and push it into the empty driveway. Since I did not have the key I could not do even this. 

The car ended up getting impounded. They say she owes the city several thousand for the tickets, tow and impound. 

My mom wants me to help pay. She even wants me to sell my motorcycle and give her the money. I don't want to do this. I feel like she brought it on herself. So am it the asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: I’ll keep it at short as possible. Me (22m) and my ex (21f) broke up after a 8 month relationship due to personality disconnections. I just didn’t feel as strongly for her as she did for me, and neither of us took it too harshly. 

She still considers me the ‘perfect’ boyfriend and all these other things, said she wouldn’t dare look for someone else until she’s completely over me, and sincerely wanted to remain friends, and I’m okay with that, she’s cool, just wouldn’t date her. 

A few weeks afterwards we were talking and she mentioned she wanted some ‘fun’ and asked if I’d be willing to come over and help her out. I expressed concerns at first, but she seemed kinda desperate and I’m not actively dating either due to extensive work schedules. If we’re both single I don’t see an issue with a FWB type of deal. So we messed around. I did tell her early on that she shouldn’t expect it to reignite the relationship, and she understood. 

Long story short, after a few yippee sessions, she told her friend, who told her little social group, who are expressing deep frustration towards me for doing this, telling me “I’m messing with her emotions” and “why do I fuck her if I don’t want to be with her”. I told her about and all she really could do was apologize but said she doesn’t want to stop doing the dirty. 

AITA? I see it could be kinda wrong considering she still has feelings for me whereas I don’t as strongly for her, but if she is actively telling me she wants to do the dun dundun, I don’t see much harm in it and wanted another opinion. 

Thank.

input: This is my first post ever here so I don’t know if this is kinda a weak one or not

A little backstory to understand everything: I’m a kid still going to school. My parents got divorced in 2013. Both my mom and my dad have found new lovers. I hate my dads girlfriend and I like my moms boyfriend. I always go home to my mom on friday to be there for the weekend.

Roles:
Mom= mom
Dad= dad 
My dads girlfriend = dg
Me = me


So this happened yesterday. I had been sick for a few days and was feeling dissy and and had a real bad headache. I had just been sleeping all day when I woke up at around 2:00 pm feeling very hungry so I went out to the kitchen and made myself some soup after I had eaten it I just put the bowl of the left over soup in the kitchen (I was feeling super tired at this point I just wanted to sleep) I went back to bed and woke up at around 4:30 pm to my dad coming home. Dg was home all day but was just laying in bed watching anime (yes, anime). My dad went out to go do the dishes when suddenly dg sees it and rushes out there and starts shouting at my dad saying that I should do the dishes and my dad is all confused over what happens I then come out in to the kitchen when I see dg rushing towards me looking like she’s about to hit me in the face. She doesn’t hit me but she was mad. Luckily I had to leave because I had to get home to my mom because I had this event at my school (which went really well and I’m also feeling way better) so I had to get some stuff at my moms. I luckily also had to stay at my moms house until Monday.

Tl-dr 
I’m sick and hungry I then go and make myself some food after I eat I leave the dishes out and fall back asleep. I wake up when my dad comes home. My dad goes and does the dishes when my dads girlfriend goes insane on him and me for me not doing the dishes even though I’m clearly very sick

At first A and I were good friends, we didn't hang out as much though as I was dating someone at the time and wanted to be respectful of my boyfriend by not hanging out with other guys alone. Long story short my boyfriend cheated on me and we broke up. A was the second closest person I was closest to and we talked more and more as I was completely heartbroken. About a month goes by and we're talking (we've gotten closer now) and A said he had a crush on me while my boyfriend and I were still dating and after thinking it through for a few days I tell him that I like him too. I ask him out a bit later and it's been going good for about a week now.

I'm scared of telling my mom he's trans- especially since I haven't told her we're dating yet. A says it's ok that my mom doesn't know so that we can sleep over and go on dates and my mom will see it as a girl thing and not us dating but I feel like I'm exploiting his gender.

input: TL;DR on bottom

I'm going to do my best to tell this story as impartially as possible. Some background info: I live in an apartment and share a room with two other dudes (one of which I'll call ""M""), and the apartment is occupied by only one other housemate aside from us. For her sake, I'll call her ""Q."" Q has a dog that we'll occasionally take out to use the bathroom, let into our room to watch, feed/give water. One time when we were watching the dog in our room together, the dog darted into our trash can, took a bunch of tissue paper, and ripped it up under my bed (making a pretty massive mess). Ever since, we've relocated the trash can to the bathroom. I asked Q what I should do about it since it's her dog, and she told me that since M has vacuum duty, he would be the one to clean it up. Well yesterday, M was doing vacuum duty, but did not vacuum the dog's mess because it was ""too big to vacuum.""

What do I do here? Do I just suck it up and clean it for the sake of not being an asshole? Do I ask Q to clean it up since it's her job?

TL;DR: Housemate's dog ripped up a bunch of trash under bed, housemate told me roommate would vacuum it, roommate told me it was too big to vacuum, the mess is still there.

My neighbor goes to bed at 10 pm.  Sometimes, when I'm walking (not jumping, not marching, *walking*) she bangs on the floor (her ceiling) to make me, I don't know, go to bed?  
Last night was especially bad.  Long story short, my closet rod broke and was fixed, so I had to put all my clothes back in the closet.  I'm also preparing for a friend visiting, so I ran the shower a little to clean my mop.  This was happening around 12 or 1 am.  Apparently, the shower running briefly (what if I was had to work at 2 and was actually showering?  She can't be mad about that, right?) was too loud, so she banged on the ceiling again.  I stomped - once - back.  
20 minutes later, the police are at my apartment door to let me know there was a noise complaint.  They can't do anything, because I'm clearly not playing music, there two of us in the apartment, we are in our bathrobes, but they wanted to let us know.

Now complete the following example-
input: The bride is my cousin. She is very selfish, spoiled, and childish. 
I moved in with my aunt and uncle (her mother and father) in order to attend school. Within that time, my cousin and I became very close. She even asked me to be the Maid of Honor in her wedding! (Which later I found out, she also asked the other 2 bridesmaids to be the MOH. All of us said yes.) 
As time passed, I began to realize how shitty of a friend and person she was.

Every topic had to be centered around her life. The only interest she took in my life and my own personal struggles was when she wanted to share the details with our other friends. 
In one specific instance, I was seeing a guy I knew my father disapproved of. After telling my cousin that I didn’t want my father finding out about our quick ‘fling’, she got drunk told him 2 weeks later. 

This is when I learned I could never trust her. 

If I hung out with anyone else in her absence, she would come to me crying, asking why I was upset with her and why I didn’t think to invite her. This happened on multiple occasions with one of the bridesmaids in her wedding, which I began to get very close with. 
Our friend, Anna, was the friend I never knew I needed. She was charming, supportive, and upbeat. This was a stark difference from my cousin who was constantly negative and self-centered.

Then, I accepted an internship and have to move away for 4 months. The wedding is going to be while I’m away. I tell my cousin that I will fly in for the wedding. In my last few months of staying with my aunt and uncle, I knew I had to be very strict about how I delegated my time. I admit I was very selfish. I wanted to be with Anna and my father more than anyone. I would spend many nights bouncing back and fourth between the two. 
Anna and I would go to the mall or have sleepovers. When we would go out, we would shoot my cousin a text inviting her. She always had a bullshit excuse like “I have a class tonight so I need to take a nap” or “My fiancé and I are packing (Granted, this would be a solid reason if we knew she wasn’t actually packing.)” 

Finally, a week before I left, my cousin asked me every single day, “Are you going to be able to take off for the wedding?” To which I reply, “I am honestly not sure. They are very strict about days that I take off, but I will just leave and get reprimanded if I have to.” 

I move all of my things 2 hours away, to my mom’s house, so we can leave Saturday to head to my internship. (A 14 hour drive)
As soon as I arrive to my mother’s, my cousin sends Anna and I a text. And I quote, “Do yall even wont to be in my wedding, because neither one of you have treated me like you would like me around  for the pass month or so. I will give u the money back on ur dress.”

I replied, “Anna and I are friends, just like how you and I are friends. We didn't kick you to the curb. We asked you to come along more times than I can count - you just always had something else you had to do.
We understood that. We never got mad and upset at you for being busy - just like we never expected you to be upset when we continued our plans without you being there.
If you don't want me in your wedding, that's fine. It's your call to make. I just think you picked a very opportune time to kick me out. You should have told me to my face. And yes, I would like for you to pay me back.” 

She texted me a giant guilt trip about how she always felt left out and unwanted. I know she’s simply being manipulative, wanting me to feel sorry for her, but I do feel sorry for her. I’m starting to feel guilty for her paying me back. 

AITA? Should I return the money? I’m still out of the wedding, but I feel guilty or taking her money.

Now complete the following example-
input: A couple years ago, when I was 20, my female friend who was 2 years older than me invited me to come drink at her house. 
A little background. I was relatively new to drinking, having only had my first alcoholic beverage 4 months previous, and only having drunk a handful of times since then. I'd never been seriously drunk. She was an experienced drinker who drank several times a week (because college I guess) She asked me to bring a bottle of tequila, limes and salt, which I got from another friend.
I'd also recently had a breakup, like 2 months previous, with a girl that I'd swore up and down was my soulmate, having dated for 2 years up to that point. the ex was the only person I'd had sex with at the time. My friend, we'll call her Sara, had helped me get through it. We'd been friends for (I think) 7 years. It's hard to remember exactly how long because I have terrible memory for a lot of my childhood/adolescence. We'd always had a lot of fun together- we made each other laugh more than anyone else I've spent time with, and she helped me with a lot of personal problems. (We'd never considered a romantic or sexual relationship up to this point, though)


When I first got there, Sara's friend, we'll call her Amanda, was also there, but wasn't going to drink. Sara and I did a couple shots while shooting the shit, talking about dumb stuff that people make small talk about. When Sara invited me, she said said she'd make dinner but when I got there she just wanted to start drinking. Amanda left after about an hour and we started watching New Girl on her couch. She wanted to do shots, so I did more with her. In the course of just 4 episodes+the time that Amanda was there, I personally had done 7 shots. I think she did 5. I'm a 200 pound guy and she's a 160 pound girl, just to give an idea of how drunk we were.
It had been a really long day for me, so I kinda leaned on her while we watched NG, and at some point I fell asleep. We had always been pretty comfortable with consensual touching like hugs and light cuddling etc (but nothing sexual)  so I don't feel this was inappropriate of me. I guess she kept watching New Girl, but I woke with my head on her lap and her hand in my pants. Being very drunk, I took this as a sign that she wanted to get frisky. So I sat up and we sloppily made out. Since her hands were all up in my business, I assumed that reciprocating would be okay, and clumsily tried to start fingering her. She grabbed my hand and pulled it away, but kept making out with me. I thought she was teasing me, as she was still playing with my bits, so I tried to do it again a few minutes later. She pulled my hand away again and kept laughing at me. I'm really confused at this point. Does she want to have sex with me or not? So I kept kissing her, and she kept kissing me. I should mention she was biting and sucking my neck, which left EIGHTTEEN different hickeys (yes, I counted the next day. I was absolutely humiliated at work). After a while, she says ""I can't have sex with you Jared"", so I stop kissing her, stumble over to another room, and fall asleep on the floor.
The next day, everything seemed fine when I woke up except I had the worst hangover I'd had up to that point or ever since, so I woke her up. she kicked me out as soon as she woke up. 
We didn't talk for a long time. We had one short conversation a year later over text where everything seemed fine. But whenever I've seen her around, she gives me a nasty look then ignores me. I regret this event deeply- it ruined a strong friendship that I'd had for a long time. It's also ruined friendships with mutual friends that we had, one of which thinks I tried to rape Sara and won't even listen to my side of the story.AM I the asshole for trying to have sex with Sara?

Now complete the following example-
input:    Thanks for your opinion, this is my first post to any sub in Redit.
I clean house and do other small jobs for a lady I'll call Jill.  Jill is the type person who is very set in her ways and believes her way of doing things is not only the best way but also the most common sense way. I don't have a problem doing a job for someone the way they want it done however Jill can always find very fine, minuscule details to complain about.  The problem with this is Jill has a very sharp tongue and a harsh way of talking. She makes me feel like a slave, an idiot and incapable of doing anything right. 
   The thing is it's not really that I've done anything wrong. Maybe I did what she considered to be step 2 first or maybe I did something the way I've always done it which should be fine as long as it gets done but no, according to her I should have folded to the left instead of the right, etc. 
    I should mention I have a problem with depression and anxiety. Even on a good day for me by the time I leave her house I'm in tears, upset, defeated and just a mess. I'm a 56 year old widow, I have a very hard time dealing with the loss of my husband still. I have an adult autistic son who lives with me. I also have a daughter who is divorced and has 10 year old twin boys that I help with. I have a lot on my plate.
    Now here's my dilemma; Jill is as I have outlined but she is also someone who believes in God and believes in being blessed by blessing others and helping people out. Jill has helped me out with some financial problems over the past two and a half years. In total she has paid off $2,100.00 in debt on my behalf which helped me out greatly. She has also done some other small things for me.  She does not want or expect me to pay her back, it was not a loan. She felt led to help me and knows that she will be blessed for doing so.
    So, AITA for wanting to quit working for her because I feel it would help my mental and emotional health? 
    One last note, Jill has a very hard time finding people to work for her. I know this to be a fact as I've known a couple of people who have worked for her in the past but left because they would not or could not put up with being treated this way by Jill. I've come to believe now that Jill may do things for me to try and keep me there, hoping I won't quit if she does these things. 
    Thank you for reading this and for your opinions.

Now complete the following example-
input: So: some background before I begin. 

I’m 19 and I’m that kid who hasn’t really had a rebellious phase and usually does what my parents say. I wouldn’t say I’m an angelic kid, I just don’t really like arguing because my father can get violent when he’s mad and I don’t have the energy to enter into debates either.  (My mom can be scary too but I blame my dad for making her that way because he throws things at her and I can think of 10 occasions where he has hit her and kicked her...not like the movies where she gets a black eye or whatever but it has caused her a great deal of emotional pain and 2/10 times, physical pain) I don’t want my mom to get hurt by my angry dad too. 

Anyways, I have made snarky remarks or shouted back at him when it gets too much but I usually back off and apologise eventually but not today. A point of contention between us is usually the career I’m going to pursue in uni and today was no exception. I would want to do early childhood edu or mass communications (those are my interests) but he always insists on me being a doctor because the pay is high (Yup you guessed it, we’re asian!) but I know deep down he wants me to pursue medicine for two reasons 1) Because he himself failed the medicine interview because he said something wrong 2) Because all his friends have children that are doctors of lawyers.

The agreement we settled on was this: If my A level grades are good enough, I would just apply for Medicine in University X for the lols. But at the same time, I will apply for Accountancy (a ‘compromise’ course between the two of us because Accountancy is the next best thing) in University Y. I can choose to reject Medicine in University X in the end and I don’t have to do anything to buff up my resume for it. (In Singapore where I’m from, your resume is quite important to get selected)

All of a sudden today he insists that I participate in a community project that does eye check ups for the elderly. I said no because that was not what we agreed on. 

Its really not that I don’t want to do community service but I’m starting work soon and I have million of things I have to do. Also, his purpose is not for me to provide goodwill to the community but for me to get into a course that I hate. 

He knows Medicine is bad for me because Medicine is a competitive course and I am REALLY REALLY easily stressed. But he shouted at me and said that even if I committed suicide after two weeks he would send me off happily! (twice with so much vigour you would think he was possessed because I said nothing vulgar or in a loud voice) + I should go to my room and shut the door TIGHT. (the emphasis on the word ‘tight’ insinuating I should suffocate myself to death I guess?) I felt super heartbroken because he knows I have entertained serious thoughts of suicide multiple times throughout my life (once was just 3 months ago)

I then shouted back at him that I would not even want to breathe the same air as him (which to be fair is a really elementary and lame retort) but he came charging towards me saying that I need to take it back and apologise with the loudest voice I have ever heard. In my fear I closed the door and locked it before he could do anything to me. He continued to shout at me saying I am a bad daughter for shouting. 

The thing I feel bad about is that, not only did I make him angry at me, he is now angry at my mom who stood up for me. I also revealed by accident that she told me privately that she would support me in whatever course I do (something we both know might incur his wrath). Within minutes he began throwing things around and raising his voice at her which is making me scared af. (things have cooled down between them for now though)

AITA the asshole for making my father upset and also creating the risk that he may hurt my mom? I used to think he did love me (he is really really nice to me when he isn’t mad) but he just told me to die and recently he seems more obsessed with his image rather than my life? 

Ps: I have a sister who is keen on medicine and he doesn’t even shout at her while he calls me names like fat pig (I am slightly chubby), ugly, idiot and points his fingers violently in front of my face like a maniac. He is really proud of everything she does, even if rude towards him, and happily says that “Haha, this is karma for when I was rude to my parents. She’s indeed Papa’s daughter.” The thing is when he’s lonely I always talk to him, keep him company, hug him etc which she doesn’t do in the slightest. I feel so heartbroken that being a doctor is all he cares about, really, but thats besides the point.

tl;dr - Dad who wants me to do Medicine but I don’t want to. Proceeds to tell me he’s okay if I died and starts throwing things at my mom because he’s pissed off.

Now complete the following example-
input: Me and my girlfriend are together for a few months. Everything is going well except for one thing - when she drinks, she turns into a completely different person: makes offensive jokes about people's weaknesses (sometimes to their face) and doesn't consider how they might take it, casually shares very private information about herself as well as other people (including me), talks very loudly, and generally acts like a stereotypical drunk-teenage girl even though she's in her late 20s.

&amp;#x200B;

I confronted her about this a few weeks ago, after she introduced me to her best friend that she hasn't seen in a couple of months by taking us both to a restaurant. At first, everything was fine, but after a while, the two of them got drunk, lost track of time and started gossiping about people they both know from high school and I don't know. I got a little board and didn't really mind, but after about three hours of this I told her that I wanted to go home, but didn't mind if she wanted to stay out with her friend. She ended up coming home about three hours later, and went to sleep after I rejected her attempts at coming on to me.

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning I confronted her about this, and she took it really badly. When I said that I didn't agree to sex the previous night because she acted very sloppy and I wasn't into it, she took it as if I said she's disgusting, which I made clear I don't think that. She said that because the things I criticized her for are not things that put her or anyone else in danger, than I don't get to police how she acts when she's drunk, and now I'm wondering if I'm the Asshole.

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: she really is not an alcoholic. She doesn't drink very often, and she really is a responsible drinker. My issue is that the way she acts embarrasses herself and me. Another note is that this behavior is nothing like the way she acts when she's not drunk, and that I truly, deeply, love her for how she is when she's sober. She has this idea in mind, that the way you act when you're drunk is ""the real you"", because this is when all the masks come off (which I highly disagree with. How is your behavior when you're on a **mind-altering substance** ""the real you""???), and that me criticizing the way she acts when she drinks means that I don't like her as a whole, which is not true.

Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

Now complete the following example-
input: So, as the title suggests, I spend a lot of time with this individual. As such, I understand that we are, at some point, bound to have a spat. Still, when it happened today, I was left pretty floored by it.

We work at a shoe store. Sometimes when looking for shoes in the stock room we take the display from the floor; “singles,” part of the job is to put them back. She left a shoe there, I picked it up and (very obviously jokingly) said “forgetting something?” We joke around with each other, “razzing” one and other like this constantly, it’s always in good nature. So imagine my surprise when she turned around and spat something along the lines of “don’t even give me attitude for that, ____, because you’re the worst one for it.” And stormed off. A. I am most certainly not the worst one for it, and she should be the last one saying I am. B. What the fuck?

So I’m generally pretty timid, especially with her, but that left my jaw hanging to the floor. So I picked up the single, followed her out, slapped it on the shelf, said “FYI, I was joking” and walked away. She then followed me back and said “don’t take that attitude with me” in the bitchiest voice; she is a shift lead and I am an associate but I thought it was so fucked to flex on me like that as we should be friends before anything else.

After that we ignored each other for a bit, until I asked her if she was mad at me and she said “no not at all,” but continued to ignore me. I later bought her a cookie on my lunch break and things were pretty normal for the rest of the shift.

I have some other issues with the living situation which I’ve never bought up because I didn’t really mind them, they’re just unfair, but depending on how the talk goes when she gets home after her shift I may just unload it all in one big surprise package.

input: So, this happened back in May where my mom asked if she wanted her boyfriend to start living with us. I said no, but my mom made him live with us ever since May. This was a couple weeks after my father passed away of old age, and she's letting a new man into the house when I'm not even over my father's passing. 

I feel very uncomfortable in my household and have talked to her about not making him love her 24/7 since I can't have friends over or do everyday things like shower and change comfortably. 

He does do good things like pick us up from school, but occasionally me and my sister can hear them having sex from across the house. Me and my sister are very uncomfortable about this, and both of us have talked to her. But, my mom hasn't done anything.

Now complete the following example-
input: I’m 14 fyi 

He came from Greece just to see me. He lives in Greece, and I live in a Scandinavian country. He visits sometimes in the year, and he came December 23rd and he’s going January 5th. We spent Christmas together and he gave me two books. I feel bad, because now I feel like I have to spend time with him. He says the only reason he is in this country right now, is because of me. And I haven’t even been out with him yet. I haven’t even showered or done anything. He messages me every day wanting to be with me, but I’ve declined a few times because I just can’t handle it. He wants to go out all the time and it’s stressing me out. I also can’t manage to get up, shower, being social and all that stuff.

I in all honesty think he is intrusive. If he wasn’t here I’m sure I would’ve showered and gone out for a walk. But his presence just makes it all so unbearable.

He lives in another apartment because my mother and him are separated. Yesterday he came home with food(and I’m really thankful for that btw) and I usually have a hard time eating food with others so I waiting for him to go until I would eat. But he didn’t go. I asked if it was okay if I started to eat now, and he said yeah sure, and I told him that I usually eat while watching something alone, and he still didn’t get the reference. I told him ok so is it okay if I go to my room. He said yeah yeah I’ll be waiting for you outside. I mean, there’s nothing wrong with that I guess. I don’t even know why that made me feel so uneasy and annoyed.

So well, now I don’t want to spend New Years with him because I would much rather stay in my bed and do nothing. Like I’ve done for months now.

I have to try to see it from his perspective. He lives in another country, without his daughter, was happy to see her and has missed her.

So WIBTA if I don’t spend time with him and for my overall opinion about him?

input: I (26F) have 2 main groups of friends, a group that I've been friends with since high school (call group A) and a group of friends that I've known since I was 19 (call group B), and I have one best friend who is part of both groups with me. We do many things with both groups of friends, but it's always been seperate, simply because both groups don't really know each other that well, and wouldn't really mix with each other and a few girls out of each group don't really get along. 

Quite a while ago, a girl out of Group B planned a night of drinking at hers, unfortunately my partner was out and I couldn't find anyone to look after my children that particular night so I had to decline. The day it was planned for came up and a girl out of group A messaged us all and asked if we wanted to meet up that night but same as above applied and I had to decline, another girl had suggested they could come to mine instead so I said you're more than welcome, so some of group A came to mine for a couple of hours for a mini catch up.

Somehow, the people from group B found out and they are not happy one bit that they didn't get an invite. It's not that I purposely missed them out, but it's how its always been that we always do things seperately with each group, and as far as I assumed they had plans anyway. Things was said, and I explained sometimes them lot do things and don't invite us but we're adults and that's what happens. 

I feel like I've been sucked back into high school times, and feel like its 15 year old me and something daft.

Now complete the following example-
input: It happened a while ago, but it still bugs me.  
There was a guy, I knew. He was a step father to my ex.
He was an extreme alcoholic, who would steal from his own house and family (wife and kids) just to have money for alcohol. His daughters saw him at his worst. He got kicked out of house by wife multiple times after he lost his job due to alcoholism and left her alone with all life expenses as well as some debt. He was not a bad person per se, he clearly lost to his inner demons. Yet as a result he made everyone around hate him, including his daughters not wanting to see him anymore.    
At some point he has commited suicide. Suddenly everyone started behaving as if he was a saint or martyr. As if he was a pure good, just put in unfavorable situation that overwhelmed him. They started taking blame for everything that happened to him despite the fact that it absolutely wasnt their fault. They even tried to help him while he was alive but he refused to see the issue.  
And so I have told my ex, that he has brought it upon himself. That his story was sad, as he wasn't bad guy but I do not feel bad for him as his own actions led to this. He refused their help and she should not guilt herself foe his death.  
She was the only one I told that. The hell that broke loose... Was extreme. Until the very end of relationship few months later she did not forgive me.
Am I the asshole for my approach? I tried to be understanding, but at the same not let my ex fall into the spiral of guilt and sadness.

Now complete the following example-
input: Throwaway because I literally feel terrible and actually feel as if I have done wrong.
I have known one of my friends for most of my life. I met him in preschool, when I we were 5, and we are now 23. We went through primary school, high school, and partially university together. He's not my best friend, but he's one of my close friends. A few weeks ago he started acting strange. At first, we asked what was wrong and he said he just felt ""off"". We weren't really bothered, just concerned for him. We began to hang out with him more just to see if he was okay, but apart from being quiet most of the time, he joined all of our activities. Then, yesterday, we were at his house and he sat us down and told us he was gay. We were surprised, but as it didn't directly affect us, we didn't say much. However, we did congratulate him for doing something that can be really hard. After we all finished, he left to go upstairs. Me and my other friend followed around 5 minutes later. He was crying, and we knocked. He opened the door and let us in, and he had knocked over most of the furniture in the room. This was our first warning flag, so we asked what was wrong. He just lost it, he started wailing, not making any words, and just screaming. I got my friend to tell the others not come up and I slowly calmed him down over about half an hour. Once he was calm, he told me he was angry that we didn't ask more. That's all he said. I asked him what he meant and he stood up and shoved me, saying that I should know what he means.
This is what he said (from what I can remember)
""What the fuck is wrong with all of you? I just told you something that I've been hiding for a while and you just leave it by saying you're happy for me? Don't you, as my friend want to know more? And even prior to today, you never asked if I was gay, I mean you didn't get the vibe? That just shows that you don't ever pay any attention to me."" I was shocked and at a loss for words. I ran out of the room and a wave of guilt washed over me. He came downstairs and started telling us what he hates about us until we left. I told my girlfriend what happened and she said we had no reason to ask more, because we accepted him, and I agreed. However, one of my other friends told me that we could of enquired more about it because it was a ""traumatic"" experience for him. 
I cannot stop thinking about it, I have taken a day off work today, and im just really conflicted as to whether we should of taken more action.
So, AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: I usually tell my SO I am off my period a week after I actually finished bleeding because sometimes I still have some spotting episodes. To just avoid having sex while I'm accidentally bleeding, I just tell him a week later.

On Monday my SO and I had some plans for some sexy time. We were supposed to go two rounds but after our first round where I gave him oral he ended up falling asleep. No sexy times insued after. 

The same day he acquires a new video game. It's not a problem until I start feeling in the mood but he just won't put the controller down. 

I work 6 nights And I am on my feet 100% of the time. I usually get home very exhausted and paired with all the chores I have to do on the daily, I feel like if he would help out a little i wouldn't be so frustrated. 

Also I work nights so I get home fairly early (around 2) in the morning. He is sometimes on it until way after I have fallen asleep and it's morning time. 

I have absolutely no problem with it at all, unless we made plans to have sex then yes I would feel annoyed. 

Last night, he finally stopped playing his game. And we were watching a movie. In the movie they were making sexual innuendos and he turned and looked at me and said ""what about sex stuff? ;)"" (I think he was being sexually suggestive). 
But I guess I'm dumb because I can't read cues. And he wasn't being straight up. 
And he had already ruined my mood since the beginning of this week. 

Fast forward to this morning,
He asks me how I'm doing and I tell him I'm starting to feel my period pains coming (heavy breasts and hurting lower back). And he said ""I swear you just got off your period. I don't know what's going on with you""

So now I feel really bad and targeted. I can't control my body from doing what it's supposed to do. I feel so frustrated and annoyed. I want to cry but somehow I feel like it's just my hormones messing with me.

Now complete the following example-
input: (Maybe important to note, we're both gay guys)

So a bit of backstory, recently my boyfriend left me for the sake of his mental health - basically he has anxiety and the relationship was making it worse because I'm not exactly in the best space mentally - and I thought that was all fine and good, however, he then got annoyed with me for telling my friends about it, he posted on his Instagram ""yes, me and redacted broke up, if he's allowed to talk about it I am.""
One of my friends tried to talk to him about it, basically saying he was being to blunt with everything (the same day as the break up, before it actually happened though, I had been pretty upset yet he refused to talk to me) and he understood why we broke up but he could've tried to be nicer about it. I started to think my ex was being selfish, however since it was for mental health issues I'm not sure.

Tl;dr: my boyfriend left me because our relationship was damaging to his mental health, he then went on to be annoyed when I told my friends about it, and one of my friends messaged him calling him selfish for not caring how I was feeling.

I was sure he was just being selfish yesterday, however now I'm not so sure.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole?

input: We have been dating for a month, and we are sharing stories about our friends and stuff. She told me that she has a male gay friend, and once the friend said he wanted to kiss her. She laughed it off and didn't do it. This was way before we started dating, and a couple of months before the dude came out as gay. So I told her that maybe he was conflicted and just wanted to see how kissing a girl would feel like. Maybe he waned to experiment so that he could be clearer about his sexuality. She didn't respond well to this text, and said to drop the matter when I asked her whether I said anything wrong. I honestly had no intention of hurting her feelings, but I feel I may have mistakenly done so. Am I the asshole?

It didn’t go over well.  She said that it’s an insult.  That she know she’s gained weight and doesn’t need me to tell her about it.  I have been EXTREMELY careful not to mention her weight gain.

Now complete the following example-
input: In November I got my dream job in my dream city. My husband and I have been trying to get back to New England for a year now, with no luck. He was more actively searching because of higher income, but no offers came through until mine. 

I moved in December, and he started applying for jobs like crazy and got one in January. Slight pay cut, but we’ll be happier in our new city and near family and friends. 

I packed a lot before I left, and flew back 3 weeks ago to pack and organize more - house was a mess, he hadn’t cleaned since I left. I cleaned everything and packed even more. 

I wasn’t able to come back closer to moving day because of my work schedule... right now on my 14th consecutive day working, and have big events through all of March. 

I’ve done everything I can remotely, scheduling a cleaner and listing a ton of furniture on Facebook Marketplace (and dealing with the barrage of messages). 

It’s his last night and he’s been having panic attacks, hurt his shoulder, and is generally pretty pissed at me. He said he’s been spending 5-6 hours every night for two weeks getting things ready and the most stressed he’s ever been. I’ve been trying to be extremely sympathetic/supportive/grateful, and offered to do all of the unloading/unpacking once he’s here. He’s quite traumatized from this experience and I can’t help but feel very selfish. 

One big thing is that he packed a moving pod 2 weeks ago that should have had everything, and he missed a lot - so now we have to donate a lot more than we had planned on. I tend to be the pragmatic one in the relationship who can stay organized/sane during a move. 

Note: we are also selling the house, so he’s getting it ready for sale and dealing with contractors too

TL;DR moved before husband due to job, he’s packing everything up himself and miserable. 

AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: Asking because in my book, using ultimatums **is** an asshole move. I never thought I'd end up here and it sucks.

But as the title says, I gave my spouse that ultimatum because they are unwilling to work on their issues and have made me responsible for helping them out with unfucking their life. That's too huge of a burden, I am not a therapist, despite them treating me as their live-in therapist because I do not work due to disability, and according to them ""I also have issues"", which is true! Issues for which I have gone to therapy, read books, and improved in other ways even my friends have noticed. My spouse has also noticed I have become a better person, strangely enough.

My spouse has tackled the easiest problems so far, with my help. But they refuse to face the fact that I am not a therapist, and I cannot help them overcome the more serious stuff. The more serious stuff has been causing damage between us for years now.

How would I even begin to know how to help them with this, I have trouble helping myself sometimes.

My spouse has not been able to help with my issues since they are due to chemical imbalances. I am recovering from depression and complex PTSD due to childhood trauma. It's been either me alone, or therapy helping.

My spouse also has a history of familial trauma, yet they insist they don't need therapy, they just need me to help them and for me to ""be patient"".

It's been 6 years and we keep having the same fights over and over, over the same things, because they won't get help. I'm at my wits end. I know I do not have it in me to be patient forever.

Now complete the following example-
input: So I’m (21m) currently in pharmacy school and for the past year or so I’ve been commuting (about 30-45 mins one way) to school from my place by myself. Colleague/friend (30m) who lived very close to campus ran into some financial troubles and had to move back home about 10 mins from where i live. He doesn’t have a license let alone a car so he asked me if he could catch a ride with me on school days since we have the exact same schedules. 

This has been going on for around 2 weeks now - he’d uber to my place in the mornings and head to college then I’d drop him off home after (15 min detour from my house) and head home. He doesn’t compensate me in any way nor have I asked but I’m okay with this since he’s a friend. 

Recently though I’ve found myself wanting to make plans after college with friends at places away from our town. Not to mention that I pick up some extra shifts at work so he has to wait for me 2-3 days of the week to get out of work at 9pm. Several times I’ve hinted that he should catch rides on the way back instead with other colleagues who live literally right down my road so he doesn’t have to wait for me but he doesn’t seem to be getting the hint. Any of my plans, whether they be recreational or work related, are pretty spontaneous so I wouldn’t be giving him much notice but there isn’t anything I can do about that. 

A part of me feels like I would be an ass if I changed my plans suddenly on him but on the other hand, it’s my car, it’s my gas, there’s no compensation and I go out of my way to drop him off home every night anyways. we have no agreement on anything I’m just doing him a favor for the time being. I’m happy to continue giving him lifts but I don’t want my schedule to be tied up around me requiring to take him to and from college every day. 

Would I be the asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: This guy was singing very very loud and very very badly, he wasnt aware of his lack of talent and really believed he was hitting every note. I could tell because he was doing it very pasionately which made they whole experiencie worst. He was also playing an acoustic guitar just as loud and was and overall a terrible performance.

&amp;#x200B;

The train was packed. He was ""greeting"" everyone at the doors and i was standing in front of the seats somewhere in the middle with a headache and a very shitty day behind me. I could see him, yelling with his eyes closed. I endured 1 whole song. I thought He'd stop but he kept going with a Creedence song. I was not in the mood for a bad Creedence cover.

&amp;#x200B;

So I stared at him until we locked eyes and I started to move my lips slowly and as clearly as i could so he could undertand my mimiquing ""Stop, please. please, just stop""

&amp;#x200B;

He opened his eyes like to big plates in awe. like he was really shocked that someone wasnt digging being unable to hear their own thoughts, He kept going tho, i turned around and started laughing in frustation and he laughed too. when the song ended he said ""well, now im gonna play something calmer, for the girl over there that doesnt like my music"" I turned to face him again and I answered him quite loudly ""you are being too loud, there's no need to play THAT LOUD AND ANNOY PEOPLE"" 

&amp;#x200B;

He answered ""well you can always go to another car"" and that made me furious. ""where im i supposed to go? theres no place to move, we are all your hostages and you are forcing all of us to listen to you""

&amp;#x200B;

He laughed again in disbelieve and started to play a cheesy ballad but a lot quieter this time. I just stared at him shaking my head until I got out the train.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no problem with street performers as long I have a choice to partipate or not in the performance. i think it is very rude to start singing or whatever in front of people that didnt ask for it. its the same when people listen to their music on their phones without headphones. Why do we all have to listen as well? i dont want to listen to your music, actually i think performers are worst because they expect you give them money for a service you didnt even require and its not even a service....

&amp;#x200B;

I believe in the motto ""do not inconvenience others"" specially in public places, so it really boils my blood when i just want some peace and quite and travel without suffering. and the ""He's just trying to make a living"" its not enough reason to have people hostage. He can go to a park or stay in the platform where we have the choice to engage or not

Now complete the following example-
input: My neighbor has a black Labrador retriever that is very overweight (113) lbs. The reason she’s this overweight is because my neighbor went through a family tragedy and just began to over feed the dog human food and never took her out for walks. She eventually realized what she was doing was wrong and put her on a strict diet. While she is on a diet my neighbor has trouble helping her lose weight because she doesn’t have the energy to go on the extensive walks the dog needs to lose weight. 

I’m the only teenager in my neighborhood. Everyone else is either an adult who works full time or a young child. Because of this all of our neighbors decided it would be best if I helped the dog lose weight because I only work on the weekends and I have a lot of free time. I was opposed to the idea but my parents forced me to help out our neighbor. Walking this dog is very annoying and hard. It takes a lot of effort just helping her get in my car. When we go on walks the dog can’t go more than a few minutes without stopping to take a break ( I carry a dog bowl and some water in my book bag and she spends about 2 minutes resting) For her exercise were supposed to walk part of a dog park trail and I have to take a picture of me and the dog to prove we actually made it to her distance goal. This should only take us about 20-30 minutes but since she’s so fat it takes us 1hr -1hr 15 minutes. I can’t spend time with my friends and I am not being compensated. 

I was recently relieved from my duty because my neighbor’s granddaughter and her mom would be staying with her so she would walk the dog. I took her granddaughter to the park and showed her where she would be walking and how far. During this time she was walking the dog. Whenever the dog wanted to rest she would force it to keep going and she would berate it by calling it fatass instead of its name. The dog was whimpering and I could tell it was getting exhausted. I told her that she needed to let it rest but she said the dog needed to work hard at losing weight. I told my mom how she was treating the dog and she said she’ll talk to our neighbor but if this continues I should offer to walk the dog again. I told her that it’s her responsibility to get her granddaughter in check and that I would not be walking that dog again. She said I should go with her granddaughter to check if she’s treating the dog right but I don’t want to that either

Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

input: I matched with a girl on bumble about a week ago. We've been talking, but we haven't officially met yet. We talked on bumble then switched to texting. We just talk to get to know each other. No dirty pics or sexting or even phone calls. This morning she texted me that she wanted to tell me something. The following is that conversation, starting from the first thing she texted me this morning:

&amp;#x200B;

Her: ""I realized I didn't explain something to you""

&amp;#x200B;

Her: ""I mean, if you want to hear it""

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""Sure, what's up?""

&amp;#x200B;

Her: ""I was sexually abused by my ex and that is what caused the depression and anxiety. So if something sexual is what you're looking for then I'm not the one"" (She told me before about her mental health)

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""Oh wow, I'm really sorry to hear that""

&amp;#x200B;

Her: ""Just wanted to let you know where I'm coming from""

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""Thanks for letting me know""

&amp;#x200B;

Her: ""Sure""

&amp;#x200B;

Her: ""Just wanted to let you know where I'm coming from""

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""You seem really cool and sweet, but I think sex is a crucial part of the relationship. It definitely isn't the only thing, and I'm not looking for just a hookup. It's just that I do think it's an important part of the relationship. It's absolutely nothing against you. I just don't think we'd be that compatible right now""

&amp;#x200B;

Her: ""You're right I am really sweet ┌∩┐ (middle finger emoji)""

I love my job sometimes it can just throw a lot on my plate. Yesterday my girlfriend and I decided that we would wash her dog and watch Netflix while she finished her notes for class. Well today was one of those days and I texted her telling her “hey this shift was super stressful I think I’m going to go home and chill this evening”. We don’t live together btw. She then got upset at me saying I always cancel on stuff she wants to do. I cancel plenty of stuff that I have planned mainly for the same reason. We spent the whole weekend together. Went to a old car show, got some good food, and flew in a helicopter together. I don’t feel like I’m ignoring her I just feel like she’s crowding me a little. So AITA for just wanting to be at home?

Now complete the following example-
input: For reference we have been dating for almost 6 months now and everything is amazing about the relationship except this one issue. She won't tell her family we are together. Her family is very religious and she follows the religions beliefs, but very very loosely. She refuses to tell her family about the fact that we are dating because she is very worried that her family will kick her out if the house and that her church will kick her out as well. 

Those are very valid concerns and I understand them, however I have offered reasonable accommodation for if those things happen. For instance, I have my own house and I have told her I would like for her to move in with me, she can even bring her dog too, I have no issue with it. If she is kicked out of her church I told her I will help her find another church to worship at. She still will not tell them and it's beginning to impact my self-esteem immensely. 

Her parents know that something is going on because several nights a week she will stay at my place and won't go home. She tells them she is staying with her best friend who is about to move to another country for a PHD program. The excuse can only last for so long as the friend moves in April. I've been thinking she needs to come clean and tell them so that I don't lose the respect of her parents entirely. 

Over the last few weeks I have been pushing the envelope a bit so to speak and have been asking her when she is going to tell her family so that we can take the next step in the relationship (moving in together). Her response is that I'm pressuring her too much and I'm making her feel shitty because I'm ""putting her on a timeline"". So I guess the real question is... AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: So I had 7 bridesmaids. One of them was my cousin. 

My cousin just had a baby this past December. My cousin has always been kind of lazy and a flake, but now with her new baby it’s even worse. She is saying that she feels depressed, sleep deprived, and fat. I’m thinking she could potentially have post partum depression, but this is just a hunch. No official diagnosis has been made. 

In November, I start asking everyone’s schedules so that I can get appointments made for picking out bridesmaid dresses. I made two appointments in February because getting all 7 to come on one day was going to be too much. My cousin picked the appointment later in the month because she wanted the extra time to lose weight after having the baby. No problem. 

In January I sent out reminders to everyone about their appointments. I got a response from everyone except my cousin. I sent 2 more reminders to my cousin with no response. But the messages I sent did show as read so I know that she saw them. 

A few days before her appointment she asks if she can reschedule, but doesn’t give any sort of reason why. I tell her no, because I made 2 appointment times for everyone to pick from and I had made them months in advance. She said ok and that she would make it to the appointment. My aunt (her mom) said that she was wanting to reschedule because she hadn’t lost enough baby weight and she wasn’t happy with how she looked. 

Well today was the appointment day and the other bridesmaids who were scheduled showed up, but my cousin did not. My cousin didn’t message me or call or anything. Then I get a call from her after the appointment is over saying that she’s so sorry that she just woke up and that she has been really sleep deprived because of the baby. The appointment was at 1:30 in the afternoon. She was asking me if she could reschedule. I told her she can, but I won’t be going with her to whatever new appointment she makes as I’ve already done my part by making the original appointments. 

I’m nosy and so I checked her Facebook to see if my cousin  had been posting anything prior to the appointment time. Yep. She posted a status a half hour before the appointment time. So she definitely did not “oversleep”.

Then her mom (my aunt) calls me and says my cousin couldn’t come because she didn’t have the money to buy a dress and that she would be lending her the money to buy a dress and making sure that she showed up to her new appointment. Whatever. 

At this point, I was so fed up that I told her not to worry about it. I don’t want someone to be in my wedding because their mom is forcing them. I feel like it’s like pulling teeth to get her to do anything she supposed to do. If being in my wedding was important to her, wouldn’t she have found a way to make it to the appointment? I really don’t understand why I am being ignored and lied to. Or am I not being understanding enough? I don’t have any kids and so I’ve never had post partum depression. 

AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: This happened about two years ago. At the time, i had heard rumors about a party being set up for those in my class in secondary school and was very interested to join. So, i decided to ask around and finally got the names of those planning the party and decide to ask them if i can come and offer my help, thinking of a simple yes or no answer. Instead, i receive no answers or info about the party until the day it was supposed to happen( even this i found out from another friend who wasn't even planning it) or if i was even invited or was to help in some way. At some points some people  directed me to someone else , and then it would go nowhere with the again other person stating ""I'm not planning the party, ***** is! Ask him/her!"" And then directing me to another person who would repeat it over and over until the day before the party.

At this point, I'm about 70% sure they don't actually want me to go to the party, and get pretty pissed at both being left out and most importantly being bounced around and treated like a fool. So, seeing as i was due in the area for some errands, i decided to gatecrash, and act dumb to screw their party up. So I did it, only telling my good friend that told me in the location in the first place, and ONLY leaving to gatecrash at about 3pm i get a msg telling me not to come, less than 1 hour before the party was due to start. Of course, at this point im indignant, and go there anyways, wishing my good friend a happy birthday (the party was to celebrate those that had their birthdays that month) and after taking a small 'greeting' parade and some trolling left to do the errands.
AITA for doing this? What else should i have done?(In hindsight, i do feel it was petty, but those people really pissed me off.

My roommate doesn’t have a car, but I do. I don’t want to go grocery shopping this weekend, but I know she needs to go. I usually take her with me once a week. Essentially, she is dependent on me in terms of grocery shopping rides, and has been for the past 6 months, but it’s ok because I just take her whenever I go.

We live in a college town where the bus system is good (and free with our college card) and a 15 minute walk from a smaller grocery store, but it’s been raining pretty hard recently so it would suck to walk there and back.

I know she’ll ask me “are you busy? Can you take me?” No, I’m not busy, but I just don’t want to go.

input: The title is pretty self-explanatory. I'm currently pregnant at a really bad point in my life. Adoption isn't an option for a number of reasons. While my husband has been 100% supportive, I'm definitely seeking out a female perspective. Husband is fine with whatever I decide (in terms of telling friends/family for support reasons), but I'm reluctant because friend has a newly-acquired stepdaughter who she cares very deeply for. On top of that, friend probably can't have kids of her own due to medical stuff. I want support, but I don't want to overstep the need for support that my friend has... Would I be the asshole if I told my friend about my situation? Or should I just keep to myself and seek alternative outlets?

Now complete the following example-
input: So when I was a teenager (from the age of about 16 til I was 19 or 20) I had extremely poor mental health. Way beyond teenage angst, I was suicidally depressed and so anxious that I couldn't order coffee in a coffee shop or even go into a resturant without a full anxiety attack. I still suffer from moderate anxiety and occasional bouts of depression (now 24) but not anything on the scale I used to.
During this entire period, my dad made things significantly worse. He would tell me constantly to 'get over it', that I was doing it for attention, get mad at me for becoming mute and panicky in social situations etc etc.
Obviously I got better, but I have the scars to show for it.

In the last year my younger brother (20) has developed mental health issues. He's not very forthcoming with what's up, but he's had a falling out with his friends and is probably quote depressed.

Critically, however, my dad is being really supportive and is really concerned for his well-being. Obviously I am glad that he has changed his attitude. Probably the recent campaigns about mental health have gone a long way towards changing his attitude, and I'm not denying that that is great.

However there is a large, festering chunk of me that is really resentful and quite hurt that my dad cares and is providing my brother the support that I needed when I was a teenager and really didn't get, and this is materialising in me lashing out and being honestly quite nasty to my brother.

I /know/ that this is not a good way to feel about the situation, I know that I need to reign in my outward display of resentment, but am I an asshole for resenting in the first place?

TL;DR I suffered really bad mental health as a teenager and got zero parental support, now that my brother is going through Some Shit, I am resentful that my dad is supportive.

Now complete the following example-
input: My friend and I have known each other for about a year now, but we stopped talking a couple months ago. She's been suffering from depression and social anxiety for a while before I knew her. Whenever shit hit the fan, for whatever reason, I was her go-to guy when she needed to vent or needed help even though she had closer friends. I have no idea why she did this, but I didn't hate it. I was happy to help.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the time she'd be perfectly fine. Maybe 2-3 times a month she'd have a breakdown and every day besides those, she'd be fine. But it only got more and more frequent. Around 2 months into our friendship, her boyfriend of 3 years broke up with her, which would obviously hurt her for a while. From that point on, even when she was in a good mood, I could tell she just wasn't the same. The times she needed my help became very frequent, which is to be expected. She needed someone to cope with.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple months after that, her now ex-boyfriend said he started dating someone else. This made her even worse because to her (and I assume many other people), finding a new date a couple months after a 3-year relationship is pretty fast. I still helped her when she needed it, but I didn't think I was doing anything special. Like, it may have helped, but any other one of her friends could say the stuff I was saying to her. Just imagine your most cliche therapist lines. This will be important later.

&amp;#x200B;

So a couple more months after this, she wouldn't be as hurt as she was before, but her mental disorders were clearly worse than they were when we first met. We would rarely do the stuff we used to do every day for fun. When I would try to talk to her normally, she didn't really seem into it, so most of our talking came from her breakdowns now. Plus, all together, we talked way less then we did even a month from this point. From what I saw, it seemed like she wanted help rather than just someone to vent to; however, most men seem to want to help rather than just listen, so I'm not so sure on that. I felt like I couldn't help much because I didn't know much of her situation between her and her ex.

&amp;#x200B;

So I asked her one day if she could tell me the story between him and her. I told her she didn't have to tell me right away, whenever she felt ready. She'd been ignoring more for about a week (most of the time she'd at least talk to me and be unenthusiastic about it), but she didn't reply at all to that message. I expected her to at least reply with something like ""I can't right now but when I'm in the mood."" or maybe ""I really don't feel comfortable talking about that"". Her not replying to that, a couple other messages before that, and just talking to me less and less, in general, made me think she doesn't want to talk to me anymore. Like I said before, I felt like any of her other friends could do what I did so I didn't think she needed me. I'm now getting 3rd party information that this wasn't her intent, but she's not all that worse without me.

&amp;#x200B;

The main reason I chose to stop talking to her is that we completely stopped doing the stuff we were doing originally, the stuff I became friends with her for. Every time I tried to give her advice she wouldn't seem to take it, and she'd fall back to me again and it turned into an endless loop. And since I thought anyone else could do the generic therapist gig I was doing, I felt like it wasn't worth it for me.

&amp;#x200B;

So AITA for leaving in this situation?

Now complete the following example-
input: I go to a pretty good school, and for this year they decided to move me down to a different set since I had done god awful in my mock exams. 

I got stuck with this kid and his friends, and all of them are literally so braindead and annoying that it was already making me mad. Some of them are ok and are genuinely nice people, but that's 2 out of 15. 

One of the kids, the ""ringleader"" of the group, if you would, does his best to out me and embarrass me in front of literally everyone. He'll shout my name with all his friends, act stupid around me, and make the loudest noises possible only around me because he knows I have sensory issues.

I started telling them to ""fuck off"" at times, and it would come out without me thinking. I even told the teacher to tell that to them once because I was that done. 

We used to have example questions for Science second period on a Monday, and as per the usual, I was stuck with him for Science. He sat right behind me, and kept kicking my leg. He was also kicking my chair and making the same stupid noises. Eventually, near the end of the lesson, I got sick of his shit and gave him a hard punch to the gut. 

This not only ended up bad with the teachers, but also for me. Because after this, he used this as a way to start outing me more. 

I'm sick of his shit and I'd honestly throw him out a window if I had a choice.

I constantly tell him to fuck off, ignore him if i'm not already pissed off, and I just can't take this anymore.   


Oh and apparently teachers can't do shit otherwise they'd have to kick me out for hitting him. So I just have to put up with this for 4 more months.

AITA

input: [WITA] I cut off all contact with a girl because she “just wanted to be friends” Now in this case WITA is more of a “was I the asshole” rather then would I be. I hope that’s acceptable. 

___

So in freshman year of college I tried my best to get out of my shell and get into things. I attended most of the WOW events (Week Of Welcome) and the wow tours and such. I have a physical disability that makes it hard for me to really walk at the same pace most people do so I ended up being separated from my wow group that was made of of fellow students from the same building. In this other wow group that kinda picked me up as I straggled behind I met this girl we very quickly hit it off and I really started to like her. Inviting her to game night that the floor was throwing and hanging out in her room. It came to the point where I was about to kiss her when I chickened out. Next time we met I asked her if She wanted to go out with me. Like the title says. She wanted to just stay friends. Now she had very valid reasons for saying so; trouble with her family, not knowing if she was going to stay st the university we were attending after the semester, etc. I accepted that answer at first. But then later decided that I was really putting a lot into this whole thing, she didn’t really click with my friends and we didn’t really share many hobbies or classes. So I decided that there was really no point to maintaining the effort so I cut all contact and moved on with my life.  WITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: **TLDR: Asked an old fling out on a date as I'm single and just thought ""Doesn't hurt to ask, maybe she's also single"", her roommate then messages me saying leave her alone and I'm ""interrupting her growth""...?**    
 

* Here is the exchange with the Fling and I: https://imgur.com/a/3dPm0GX

 
* Here is the exchange with the fling's roommate and I (PD=high school reunion): https://imgur.com/a/4G6kOPc

Some background, I'm a male, 27, studying to be a CFP, own my own home, and own a luxury car (not bragging by any means, but this is why I am so confused at the roommate's accusation) Fling is 22/23F, never went to college and works at an antique mall (no judgement, I've been there!). Fling's roommate is 19ish(?) also never went to college, works in a small kitchen (again, no judgement). Fling and I had a thing for a few weeks, first date SHE made the move to kiss. Later in the week we go to the park and walk around holding hands, make out some more blah blah. Next week we go back to her place, cuddling in bed, one thing leads to another I go down on her only. She's never seen me without a shirt lmao. A day or two later she mentions she can't see me anymore, moving way to fast (even though she made the moves), she's not in the right head space to date or even be physical. Sure no worries, I date a fair amount so I understand. 

Flash forward like 2-3 weeks after the falling out, I ask her if she'd like to meet up for a casual date and just see how it feels. ""I can't I'm seeing someone. #wut So almost two weeks ago you can't imagine dating and you freak out and bail, and here you are SEEING someone (I emphasize ""seeing"" as if her and this dude weren't serious she could have gone out and been honest ""I'm actually talking to another guy"" etc). Very strange. But again, whatever, life y'know?

Now the screenshots linked about come into play. There is about a 5mo difference between the ""I'm seeing someone"" and my initial invite to the homecoming event. Also note the roommate messaged me almost 3 HOURS later. So if it was that big of deal why not tell me sooner? 

Am I an asshole? I feel blindsided by the roommate's response. Especially the part about me interrupting her growth, while without being cocky, feel like being in a ""better"" life position, would if anything being HELPING her grow. She is literally me 5 years ago: anxiety ridden, no college, working jobs on the ""lower"" end, money crazy tight, etc. I get it! I find(found? lol) her attractive both physically and mentally. I would loved to have been a guiding hand to her finding more and more success. I understand Fling has real bad anxiety, but if she was so distraught could she not just block me? (I am currently unblocked by both btw) 

Any advice or insight into what I did wrong and how to better handle myself in the future would be greatly appreciated!

input: A bit of background: I struggle with depression and anxiety. Sometimes I'm the happiest person in the world and others I can't make myself get out of bed for days at a time. I've had to medically withdraw from university before due to depression, and while I was gone I did some serious time with my therapist. Eventually I felt like I got my shit together enough and came back to school, but I still get down in a rut sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lately, I've been in a real tough spot. I have trouble getting up for class and doing my work, and I waste \~100% of my time. Gf obviously knows I'm struggling, but I've been trying to hide the extent of just how tough this last week or so has been from her because I know she would go into a constant state of anxiety fueled worry over my mental health. She has enough on her plate as it is, and if she starts worrying about me then she'll start neglecting herself (even more).

&amp;#x200B;

My parents live hours away, and there's nothing they could really do the help significantly anyways. They're both super busy, so I don't want to add any extra stress to their lives as they (read: mom) would worry significantly about me as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know how to get myself out of these ruts, but it just takes some time for me to get my shit together. In the meantime, I lie to my family, gf, and friends about how I'm really doing so they don't stress. It feels wrong to lie and hide things, but it feels even worse to put my burdens on everyone else.

I'm 15 years old and I have to deal with the dogs my mom got from a shelter.

Neither me nor my father like dogs but since my mom really wanted dogs my father gave the go-ahead and now we've had 2 medium size dogs for a few months.

The dogs are annoying but they're generally fine. The problem lies in my mother. From day one she dumped all the responsibilities on me and my 11 year old sister. We usually have to feed, water, and walk the dogs. I usually am awake later than my sister so I end up walking them a lot more often even though I never wanted dogs. 

As a side note one of the dogs has even nipped my 6 year old brother and has drawn blood, yet the dogs stay and my brother still won't leave the dogs alone.

So, AITA for not wanting to be responsible for the dogs?

Now complete the following example-
input: Me (22m) and my boyfriend (23m) have been together for four years now, and for the first three and a half years of our relationship he and his mother never spoke. She had basically turned on him when he came out as gay, starting off with subtle insults and digs which came to blows and she kicked him out at 17 with nowhere to go. We were friends at this point, and all of my friends already knew I'm gay, so we got quite close and got together a couple of years later. After being kicked out, he didn't have any contact with his mother or step-father until last May, although his relationship with his father is still good. 

Anyway, last July his mother messaged him out of the blue with an apology, and it was pretty decent and seemed sincere, so he decided to start talking to her again. Slowly, they started building a relationship again and even though my boyfriend was nervous about it, I could tell he was really happy to have a relationship with his mother again and I was excited for him. It came out a week or so later that she has cancer, but they caught it early and she is in treatment.

Her birthday was in September last year, and she invited my boyfriend out to her birthday meal. I didn't go, mostly because she didn't mention me in the message and we didn't want to rock the boat. They had a great time and started meeting up every couple of weeks.

I met her just before Christmas on a shopping trip with my boyfriend and his sister, and everything was good. She seemed really nice, and honestly everything seemed fine. Fast forward to Christmas Day. We spent the morning together, went to my parents' house for Christmas lunch and then to his parents' in the evening for a late dinner. I offered to help with the dishes after dinner, so it was me and his mother alone in the kitchen. Everything was fine albeit a little awkward, but then she started making little comments like ""you don't look gay"" (I'm a 6'4 firefighter with tattoos, quite typically manly I guess), and I laughed it off, but they started getting worse. The comments continued over the next few times I saw her (day after boxing day, NYD and yesterday), here's a list of some of them from all the occasions:

\- ""don't you think you'd be better off with a woman than my son?"" (he's a very feminine guy and I can tell she has a problem with that)

\- ""I don't have a problem with you being gay but I wouldn't leave you around my kids"" (she laughed at this one but I still think it's really offensive?)

\- uses ""fag"", ""queer"" and ""homo"" a lot

\- ""a man like you shouldn't be taking it up the ass""

\- ""I think it's disgusting but you do you""

\- ""the idea of you kissing my son makes me sick""

\- ""I hope he'll come to his senses and man up before you have the chance to get married""

\- ""if I die with fags around my bed I'll never rest in peace""

A lot of the times she laughs off these comments like they're jokes, but I know if she said them when my boyfriend could hear he would be devastated, because she obviously hasn't changed her ways. There's been a few times she's made these comments (especially the slurs) around her husband and his son (but not my boyfriend) and it's obvious they are uncomfortable. I mentioned to her on NYD that she might want to cool it with the comments because I don't think my boyfriend would like them, and she said something along the lines of ""he could do with hearing"", so I don't think talking to her is an option, she clearly doesn't want to change.

My problem is, WIBTA if I told my boyfriend what's been happening and that I'm uncomfortable/upset with his mother, knowing it might cause tension  in - or even end - their relationship? I know that she's obviously the asshole, but I'm worried about being one too.

So pretty much there's this girl I've known for a few years now. (let's call her R) R is super extroverted and she always comes over to my house, uninvited, and just chills around. I am a total introvert, so having R around is a bit stressful, especially when I really want to be alone. I try telling her politely to leave sometimes, but R always ends up making me feel bad about it and stays for as long as she wants. Recently I tried following advice from a friend of mine and started avoiding R and not answering the door if she was there. That didn't work out and now R comes over almost every day and basically spews love towards me and it makes me feel bad for trying to avoid her. Am I the asshole here?

Now complete the following example-
input: So, for context. A few friends and I are in a D&amp;D campaign that my boyfriend is the DM for. We've been playing off and on for about three years, and since we're all full-time students it's very hard to get us all free and in the same location for any amount of time. As anyone does, sometimes we'll check our phones during a game and get distracted. But certain members of my party, lets call them friends A and B, were on their phones constantly. Because they were distracted so often, it became that much harder to focus on the game and enjoy each others company.

Time went on and eventually, my boyfriend, another party member and I came up with what we thought was a good solution: a phone bin. Everyone would agree to put their phones away and not touch them during the game, except if really needed.

I don't recall the first time we used it, but no one said anything against it at the time. And from our point of view, it worked. People didn't use their phones nearly as much, and seemed much more engaged in the game. We also started using a phone bin at dinner theaters, events we hosted with our friends that were essentially group improv/casual escape room.

Later on when my boyfriend, friends A and B and I were talking, A and B expressed that they were super upset about the phone bin concept. They were mad that we hadn't asked them beforehand, that it was 'suddenly everywhere', and that they weren't being respected. They said that we assumed they needed supervision and couldn't focus if they had their phones. It was mostly coming from A. Friend A admitted that she doesn't even really enjoy D&amp;D and those type of things anymore. My response was that if she didn't like it, no one was forcing her to stay. Friend A took issue with that. She said she felt as if we were expecting her to stay and do these things she didn't enjoy.

I feel really bad that we made our friends upset, but I genuinely don't see why they have a problem with the phone bin idea. I also don't see why Friend A would have a problem with me telling her that she doesn't have to play with us.

So, am I an asshole here? I really don't think I'm in the wrong, but I would like a third opinion here. Thanks if you've read this far or decide to comment.

input: Im 26 and I work in an industry that is extremely competitive and has high turn over. I have worked for my company since i was 20, and my boss was once just my senior coworker and friend. He was promoted, and he brought me up the ladder with him.

In the new year our branch is restructuring. We will absorb key personnel from other branches. This presents several difficulties, namely we have an over abundance of people in certain departments.

Theres also increased competition in our branches sales force, which i run. More people means less base pay to go around, more competition means less commissions in the salesmans pockets.

My boss had two choices. Either the entire branch takes a pay cut plus a loss of bounses and we keep everyone, or he fires seven people who are redundant keeping everyone where they're at.

In private I suggested a third option. Eliminate twelve people, including members of our bloated accounting department, and give everyone an unofficial raise next quarter when we get cost of living adjustments.

He ended up firing eleven people based on my advise. In my mind this is just business, but another salesman has called my boss a dick for the layoffs without knowing my part in it. Am i a dick?

input: I’m 22 and Kate is 22. We’ve been together two years. We have never had a big argument, we live together, and she has helped me through a lot, including a death in my family. 

We always use protection but we ended up getting drunk one night and we had unprotected sex. We thought it would be fine since she is on BC. 

She told me yesterday however that she must’ve missed a birth control pill around that time and that she’s pregnant, about 5 weeks. 

We talked about kids before in the past and we both agreed that neither of us wanted kids and if somehow she got pregnant, she would get an abortion. 

Well now that she is actually pregnant she is telling me that she doesn’t think she can go through with an abortion. 

I got really upset and said that we made a decision together a long time ago that she would get an abortion if this happened and that she has to consider my opinion in this. 

She told me that it really isn’t my decision at all and that she is the one who is pregnant and she is the one who gets to decide. I said she was not being fair and I’m a part of this too but she isn’t listening to me and is planning to have the kid. I’m freaking out. 

She is being delusional if she thinks we are at all ready to have kids. Neither of us have finished university and neither of us have a lot of money. 

I really do think that she needs to listen to me and what I think about her getting an abortion but she just absolutely refuses to listen to anything I have to say about it and is planning on having this kid. I haven’t told anybody about this yet including my parents. 

AITA for telling her I want her to listen to my opinion on her pregnancy? Should I really just shut my mouth?

input: My boyfriend [19] close to 20 and I [19] both come from different financial backgrounds. He has never had to work a day in his life and my parents had me get a job at age 15. We are in college and have been dating for 3 months but friends for 3 year before that. In those 3 months he hasn’t taken me on a single date. We have movie nights that I’d kinda count as a date because we’ve both been broke as hell but I am still paying for everything that him and I want to do and we had a talk recently about him looking for jobs so we can go out and not every little thing would have to come out of my pocket. But last night as we were going to bed he told me his dad said he shouldn’t get a job because they support him financially and he needs to focus of school. I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT! But they won’t pay for our dates which is also more than fair, however this means that only I can take us out and only I can pay for us. I feel like an asshole but I financially support myself and have bills/loans/ insurance to pay. So it really stresses me out that if I want a night out then it will always be from my pocket. I fee like he shouldn’t have told me when I was half away and that he should’ve stood up to his dad about it. I’m at a loss as to what I should do and if I’m being the asshole for wanting him to get a job so he can also pay for dates.

input: This just happened. I'm selling sunglasses at a market stall and a lady is shopping for herself but a husband is there. She finally decides on the two she wants for $30. As I'm packing them up for her she starts saying things like ' I'm not sure if I've got exactly the right change.  30 is it?'
This isn't for my benefit. She's trying to trigger the husband to reach for his wallet, which he does. Just as he moves his arm to his back pocket she starts rummaging through her handbag for her purse, slowly pulling it out and searching all the compartments (all the while side eyeing her husband, insuring he gets the cash out first) when she gets $50 note out she holds it against her purse with her thumb as he's holding his fifty out to me.
I've seen women pull this move hundreds of times. 
I stall serving by saying to her 'oh that's right I've got some lens cloths for you in the car just a minute'. When I come back to the table I come back much closer to her than I do him. I grabbed her $50 instead pretending I didn't see his, foiling her plan to avoid paying.

Now complete the following example-
input: Last fall, we (myself and fiancee) offered up our basement room (with its own private full bathroom) to a friend in desperate need of a place to stay. He doesn't make a lot and also has a dog, which made finding an affordable place difficult. I felt bad and let him stay with us which was a move that I now think I made too quickly. It was agreed that this would be temporary. He said he needed till the end of 2019. He said his goal was to move to BC and find a place of his own. I was hesitant to agree to this. My fiancee and I are getting married in August and well, I thought this would be kind of weird?? But I said okay, hoping this time would give him a chance to form a plan for himself. I've known him for a long time and I know he isn't the most responsible financially. He has a ton of credit card debt, adopted a dog when he probably shouldn't have and tends to spend frivolously when he probably should be saving etc etc etc...

A little background info: We share a common group of friends. For the last 10 years since his parents kicked him out, he's been living in one of our basement's. His rent is $360/month utilities included. His rent has NEVER INCREASED. He got kicked out of one friends basement and then moved to another. Was kicked out again and now he is here with me. I never knew why but I think I might now...

Fast forward to today: Over the last few months, he's argued with me on a few things and it's really rubbed me the wrong way. When he moved in, he misunderstood me saying, ""we don't really use our basement"" to mean he gets to take over our entire basement. After he moved in, he had quite literally taken over the whole basement. His stuff was EVERYWHERE. He'd moved my stuff so his stuff without asking so that his stuff would fit. He installed stuff all over my walls in the basement without asking. He basically turned the basement into his own living room. When I told him he had to move as much of his stuff into the room he was renting, he threw a tantrum. He was so fixated on my comment and felt I was taking back something we had agreed upon (which we did not). To this day, he still has stuff all over my basement...

He says he enjoys hosting guests. Which would be fine if it were once in a while and maybe a few guests at a time. But this is not the case. Ex. One weekend, he showed up unannounced with 8 friends in tow, had 4 guests over the next day, then 6-7 guests the day after. He argued with me that he should be able to host guests 1-2x a week. And he often hosts 6+ guests at a time. This has been very hard for me as I'm a very busy person and coming home to a quiet place is my time to relax. 

He likes to host D&amp;D. But they come over Sunday nights...and then they stay over late. Like 11pm. I work early in the mornings and often have to be AT work for 7:30 am. Getting him to agree to a 10:00 curfew was like pulling teeth. I had to compromise with 10:30...

His dog sheds a LOT. It's been so frustrating because I end up having to do the bulk of the cleaning. When I asked him to pitch in to sweep once a week. He told me I just have a really high standard of cleanliness...

Last but not least, he smokes marijuana. A LOT of it. I don't have a problem with it, but I do have a problem with the smell. IT STINKS. I claims he doesn't smoke indoors but holy crap does it ever smell strong. 

There are other issues but these are the things that stand out to me. We've come to some agreements and compromises, but it's his attitude about discussing things that has me really stressed out. It's been a few months and I honestly don't know if I can handle him being here for another whole year. **Long story short? I feel taken advantage of**. $360/month rent is unheard of. In my area for something similar would easily go for at least double that amount. I did it because we are friends and I hoped it would help him save up and make a plan for himself. But so far, he hasn't made ANY plans for himself and instead continues to spend frivolously, eating out, buying things he doesn't need...and of course all of the issues above. 

So I told him this morning that I think he needs to re-consider his deadline and move out in August when my fiancee and I are getting married. We just want to move forward with married life and have kids after the wedding and I don't really want to deal with the stress of him being here. He threw another tantrum and flipped out on me. He came home today and basically holed himself in his room downstairs. AITA here?

input: This might be better suited for another subreddit but I’m really at a loss. For some background, I have pretty bad social anxiety, not enough that I never go out, but enough that I avoid going out if possible. I was talking to my current roommate about how I hated telling my old roommate that I didn’t really want to hang out and she laughed and jokingly said, “You better not do that to me next year.” For whatever reason, I was honest and said that I probably would (I can’t remember how I said it but I did try to be light-hearted). Now, she’s really upset and asking what’s the point of being friends now if we won’t be friends next year and I’m trying to explain that we’ll still be friends, but it’s just very hard for me to talk to people, no matter how close we are. So, am I the asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: TL;DR: accidentally telling that our wife pastor talked to our pastor assistant being too close to my girl church mate and asking him to maybe stop being too close because he's gonna be a pastor 🤷‍♀️ (really dont know why she said that) 

Im born again christian and have been that way since i was younger, growing up in the church and all those stuff. I did stopped atteding for personal reason and just started being active again so im not close and not as updated to whats happening but i have twin who's a lead singer in church worship ministry and 2 more little sisters who's more active than me. 

Anyway yesterday was my/and my twin birthday, we celebrated it thru youth fellowship. When i saw her i gave a tiny comment about how she and our assitant pastor doing in a joking tone. Then she started asking me what i mean and i asked her what she meant lol , then she pulled me in the side and asked me whats happening bc everybody is asking the same question basically everytime we have gathering and in church then i said ""you didnt know that our pastor wife asked him(pastor assistant) to stop being too close to you?"" And then she started tearing down and pulled me far from the room and went outside.

I was shocked cos i didnt know she would cry! And i dont like seeing people cry! I then apologize and tell her she can have a big bite to my cake later! but she said it wasnt my fault &gt;.&lt;.

She told me how she didnt know about that but shes more hurt that we didnt told her anything (tho in my head i thought she knew!) And she felt like an idiot being made fun whenever people asking her how her and him doing. Like everybody knew about it and its about her but she didnt. 


She then told me that shes been crying to God (crying while praying) about this and shes asking God for why he suddenly just plainly ignore her even in church and stopped texting too. I couldnt say anything more bc i literally have no idea what to say and i just knew about it cos my sisters was talking about it. After that she asked to leave her for a moment so i did. 


I asked assistant pastor if he was mad at me he said he's scared that maybe she'll stop going to church bc of what happen. But she did mention that she felt like  nobody cares about her feeling and nobody come forward to say anything.


I really dont know what to feel. Btw the guy was the one who approach the girl and started everything just bc he knew that the girl had a crush to him so i feel so disappointed how he handle it and ghost her.

Also to add more info, the term i used was wrong when i told her. Bc i said like ""our pastor wife ask him to stop talking to her"" but it should be like ""pastor wife said that he maybe should date someone who have same faith as him"" 

Honestly.. i dont think im an asshole but tell me what u think?

input: Long story short, my dad has history of issues (addition based mostly) and has been distant from his relatives for a long time. After my parents divorce they stopped communicating with my sister and I (age 11 at the time) and I haven't really seen them since. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to recently and my dad is in rehab again and wants to reconnect with his mom who is elderly. I found her info online and sent her a message asking if they would like to meet. They seemed happy and said yes. My dad and I went to a restaurant and met up with my grandmother, aunt, and cousin (who is 22). It was all going well catching up until we were saying goodbye and they kept talking about how important family/blood was. My grandmother made a snarky comment about my mother, who they dislike for leaving my dad for his issues, and ""jokingly"" implied I was too much like her. Literally talking about how key blood relationships were. Now it's important to note my aunt adopted my cousin years ago when she was a baby, and to my knowledge it was something she knew about. She was only a toddler when I last saw her, but she looks nothing like my aunt/uncle and my dad had told us and never said it was secret. So I commented back that Cousin seemed to be fine despite being adopted, and it was like a bomb went off.  Apparently she was never told? My dad seemed surprised at the reaction too and they left angrily. Was I wrong here?  I probably would never have mentioned it had she not gone on about how important blood ties were.

Now complete the following example-
input: Hi, so I'm about to graduate college with a degree in Computer Science. My uncle is very aware of this, so during Christmas time he hinted to me in a jokingly fashion that I should make a program for him for some type of price tracking so he can use it to enhance his chances to make a profit off of the stock market I assume. He then said I would end up getting a % of the profits he made if he made it and that is all really. I brushed it off and carried on after that.

Earlier last week he called my mother, possibly knowing that was probably his best way to get me to go to his house and for him to pitch his idea. My mom told me to call him, and I did. It all began with him saying hello, followed by saying ""Mr. Computer Science smart guy"". He then followed by asking me to show up his house and take a look at a something on his computer. I asked him what he wanted me to do, and he was like ""it shouldn't be a problem for you, you are a smart guy who is about to graduate.. if you don't know you probably will figure it out with that Computer Science brain"". At that point I was really didn't like how vague he was being and said i'll think about it. 

After I said that, he really didn't accept what I said and was like ""Alright, I'll let you go"" but then told me to text him something along the lines of ""hey, it is me and as we discussed on the phone I'll come over and help you"". Which I didn't like at all, I felt like he was trying to get some type of written confirmation on me so he could use it somehow against me(not sure if that is how it even works). After I hung up, that part of asking me to text him that just angered me and I straight up told my mother I wasn't going to do it because I didn't really want to do it and midterms are coming up, and I have my own programming assignments I have to do. I was told that basically I am an asshole for not wanting to help family, and that he is my ""Godfather"" and that I should always help family because they're blood. I stood firm with my decision, but now I am being scolded. I'm wondering if I really am the asshole in this case because I wouldn't go to his house and do what he wanted me to do because he wasn't upfront, and probably use the other family members to pressure me  to work on this project he hunted at since Christmas for me to do to only be commissioned if it made him profit.

Am I really the asshole because I didn't want to do this? I don't really know how big of a job it would have been because of how vague he was being, but I feel like I should stand my ground so people know I won't just drop everything just to work on their next idea.

Tldr:? More info I guess: 

Uncle wanted me to come to his house to ""help him with something on the computer"" I asked what the problem is and he basically answered vaguely saying that my computer science skills is needed then asked me to text him something very specific saying I would help. I didn't text him that and said I did not want to do it.

input: Background: I just moved in with a buddy from work.  About 4 days into my stay I asked if I could go ahead and pay rent.  He directed me to the online payment and I put in my card number.  Regrettably it saved my card as an option for payment on his phone too.  I told him to be careful with that but trusted him enough to leave it there. (bad idea)

Sure enough, about a week later he came up to me apologising saying he accidentally paid both mine and his portion of the rent on my card; 1452 dollars total.  I was visibly not happy and we talked about it and I realized since it was for rent and not just a random charge that it would be ok and he could just pay me back.  

This is where the excuses started.  He claims that he can only pull out 200 at a time because of the type of account he has. So to make a long story short, it's been about a week and he's paid 400 of the 720 he owes me.  We got paid yesterday and I said you can just ask for 320 in cash and deposit the rest.  He claims he can't and also said their systems are messed up and I'll have to wait another day and then still another day for the final 120.  I feel like that's total bullshit and the longer it takes the more I feel that there was no accident and he's dragging this out for hidden reasons.  AITA for feeling this way?

input: Am I being used as a rebound? 

He is a 25/m and I’m a 25/f. My ex recently asked me to go out to eat with him. We have been broken up for almost two years. We dated for six years prior to that. We have shared a lot of our growing up together. We haven’t spoken in over a year. He recently told me that he is generally really happy with his life except for his relationship with his gf as he doesn’t think they’re compatible. Yet he has always told me he didn’t think they’d work but he would give it a shot and ultimately he saw us being together but we had to mature. 

So we basically talked for six hours until five am the other night about life, our goals, how we have matured, and what our ever changing perspectives of life are. 

So he told me that he has been thinking about past good times a lot because he tends to do that when he is sad. I inquired further and he said he was thinking about what positive things have lead him to where he is now and how I influenced him a lot. He said that he is sad because of his girlfriend situation and how they’re so different and that he thought they could grow together over time but it isn’t happening. He told me he had the crazy obsessive butterfly feeling with me that he didn’t have with her and that he and I were so similar and attached at the hip for like five years. I reminded him we met as teenagers and hormones probably Played a role in that and also we have jobs and lives now. 

I also said people are so different and I’ve always wondered if we got along so well because we knew each other for so long and were so similar and saw the world the same or if that kind of grew over time. I said I wondered this with other people who I dated who were up to par but I wasn’t crazy about them. He agreed. We also discussed what we enjoyed about each other and took for granted when we were dating and I shared how I matured as a person and individual and focused on not being dependent in any way on another person (being alone and single caused me so much anxiety before). He didn’t say much in how he matured except for he appreciated people’s emotions now whereas they annoyed him before. He still focused on how much he tries to learn about technology. 

We couldn’t stop talking for hours and he gave me a very extended hug after our talk and we left and haven’t spoken since. It’s been a week. He said it was amazing to talk to me and that he may want to catch up again in the future. 

He is still with him girlfriend and has never said anything well about her ever. 

I am worried I am a rebound for him as he is having these discussions with me while still having a gf. He hasn’t been single since we broke up and am wondering if he just is afraid of being alone. 

**TLDR: ex and I talked. He said stuff like he didn’t appreciate me when we were together and his perspectives have changed. He is still dating his gf who he has never spoken positively about. I am wondering if I am just being used as a rebound**

input: Long story short, my mom's 16-year-old cat is very ill and needs to go to an animal hospital an hour away from where I live, 2 hours away from where my mother lives. My mother has asked me to meet her halfway to take her cat the rest of the way because she's scared to drive that far of a distance in her car.

I'm fine with doing that, but I'm concerned because it's possible that the appointment for her cat might overlap with my boyfriend's father's hernia surgery. I already agreed to be there a week ago before the cat got sick, but now I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. 

On the one hand, my boyfriend AND his mother will be there with his father. On the other hand, my boyfriend has already helped with my mother's vet bills and transportation to other hospitals, and I feel like being there for him through this is the LEAST I can do.

I really need an outside opinion on how to handle this. My mom is SUPER close to this cat and would be devastated if something were to happen to him.

Now complete the following example-
input: I had a major fight with a friend, because he was being dishonest and lying a lot to me. 
Despite the fact that I still believe I was right to confront him about the lying and deceiving, I realized I could’ve handled the situation better and that I fucked up. So I apologized multiple times but he said he is done with the friendship and that he doesn’t want to ever talk to me again (this was in October/November). 

He was actually really important to me so I decided I’ll give him some time and try again. We met up a couple of weeks later and he totally shut me off and told me he is moving away in April so there’s no reason for him to talk to me again anyway. I was sad about his choice and tried to accept it.  The reason I tried so many times was because the things I said were really hurtful (despite being true), plus I know him very well, he usually needs time to calm down.  

Around Christmas I saw that his favorite artist is going on tour and I managed to get two really great seats, the concert was sold out shortly after. So I wrote him a card of how much our friendship meant to me and told him maybe we can still work things out and that I wanted to take him to said concert.

He instantly forgave me and told me maybe we should have another talk after Christmas to work things out. Even tho it was kind of a surprise I was really happy that he forgave me and I looked forward to talking to him. 

Well, he never contacted me again, so I asked him in February if he still wanted to talk about things, but he made excuses and said he was super busy.

Anyway, we met three days ago (after three months) and I realized that he doesn’t want to be friends again, he just wants to go to the concert and I’m pretty certain go NC after. He couldn’t care less about me or our friendship. 

So I am thinking about not taking him and not telling him. Will I be the asshole if I do and if so, is it ok to be an asshole in my situation or what should I do?

Now complete the following example-
input:  

So I am a sixteen year old girl from Denmark, I've been in a commited realationship with my boyfriend since i was eleven, since I am almost 17 that means we've been together for almost six years give or take.

Our anniversary just rolled around and I wanna break up. See he didn't really do anything for me on our aniversary, other than giving me 100 danish crowns in cash, which he just pulled out his pocket and handed to me. No romantic gestures, no loving words, not even a single ""I love you"". I'm just so fed up with his unromantic way of treating our relationship.

It goes farther than that though, for example in 2018 we promised to give each other christmas presents, since we both could afford it, well the last day of school before christmas rolls around and I hand him a gift. He put it in his backpack, without a word, and didn't have anything for me.

He also has never given me a birthday present, or invited me on a date, not a single one. I forced him to go a date for the money he had given me on one of our anniversaries, which was the second time he has given me anything.

In total, he has only given me FOUR gifts in the span of our six year relationship, and whenever I ask to go on a walk, or do anything other than play video games on his computer, he doesn't want to.

See the video games are also a part of the problem, whenever I'm at his house, all he does is play games on his computer while I sit and watch, he does this till long into the morning hours, and I normall go to sleep a little earlier than that. So when he finally does go to sleep he wakes me, and every time he does I KNOW it's because he wants to have sex. It's the only thing that we do, that makes us seem like a couple.

I'm fed up, I've had it. He doesn't love me the way I WANT to be loved, but am I the asshole for wanting him to be more romantic?

Btw, I don't talk with him about it, because he takes any critique very personally, but even if I am in the wrong, I still want out of this relationship because the love is simply not there anymore.

Now complete the following example-
input: So around the beginning of last year my best friend started a relationship with a girl we went to school with, I liked her from around the same time, but I really didn't want to compete with him and let him try to start something with her. To my knowledge he only went on a few dates with her, and they were only really a couple for a few weeks, and I eventually learned from my now girlfriend that she never really felt a connection to him, it seems like he put a lot of value in that relationship that wasn't shared, she doesn't even consider it a romantic relationship. He did some stuff he shouldn't have that wasn't respectful to her and they split up. 

I never really moved on from her but also never really made any moves with her until she started talking to me over the summer, eventually we hooked up, and have been together for close to 8 months now. 

I told most of my other friends before the one who had been with my gf, and I never planned on keeping it a secret from him I just wanted to tell him when I felt it was right, but was forced into doing it when he was transfering back to our school, he said he was okay with it then, but I later found out he really wasn't. He's really uncomfortable around her, and me being in a relationship with her has put a lot of stress on our friendship, I didn't want to lose him as a friend, but I'm not willing to break up with my gf either, I love her.

From what he says, he thinks it's scummy that I started something with her after he had something. I think he considers her as an ex girlfriend, but it seems my gf was clear with him while they were dating that they weren't there yet, he feels that makes her off limits now, at least to his friends.

For me I feel like what they had was so minor it couldn't be considered a relationship, especially since she feels the same way. I feel like he feels something that wasn't there, and they broke up because he asked her for nudes after a week, then made a diss track on her after she said no, and stopped talking to him.

Now complete the following example-
input: Context: me and my friend are in highschool. Our school does trips to places (usually Europe) for like 2 weeks over March break. It costs around 5,000$ plus some spending money. We both signed up for this trip a couple months ago, and she just told me she wasn’t going. 

When she told me she wasn’t going to be going on the trip, I was surprised and honestly angry, and I think my anger was sort of amplified because this came out of the blue. 

So I asked her why she wasn’t going and she told me that she was worried she wouldn’t be able to find a job in time (the trip is next March) and that “she didn’t want to get to comfortable in a place where she wouldn’t be staying for too long”. Her words, not mine. 

I, admittedly, didn’t take the time to think that maybe she wasn’t being entirely honest, and I told her that those reasons were horseshit. 

She then said, and I quote, “well sorry but my parents aren’t just forking over 5000$ for me” 

I’m paying for a lot of this trip myself. My parents aren’t just giving me the money. I think she has it in her head that I’m rich, which I’m not, at all. And whenever we get in an argument she passive aggressively mentions that I “get everything I want” which I don’t. I’m definitely not poor, and I am in a position of privilege, but not rich by any means. 

When she said this, I took a minute and realized that her parents might not be able to help her pay for the trip at all, and she just didn’t tell me. 

So I apologized to her for “freaking out” and told her it was fine if she didn’t want to go on the trip 

BUT 

I’m still kind of mad. Mostly at the “your parents hand you everything” jab. And I feel like she also should have apologized. 

AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: My girlfriend and I were going to a cute date at one of those places where you drink wine and paint. On the way there (she was driving) we hit bumper-to-bumper traffic in the slow lane. She drives a sedan and we were behind a big pickup truck, the kind with the super high suspensions, so we couldn’t see anything in front of us other than that monstrosity. 

Suddenly, Mr. Monster Truck switches lanes without a blinker, cutting someone off in the right lane but narrowly avoiding what was now in front of us. You see, the stretch of highway was under construction, which meant that the shoulder was extremely narrow, hardly wide enough to pull over. Unfortunately, a car had apparently broken down, and was in the middle of being towed away. All fine and good, but the problem lay in the fact of the tow truck driver, now known as TD. He was morbidly obese, probably 400-450 lbs, and, I shit you not, he was taking up half the lane. 

Now Mr. Monster Truck had, unlike us, the capacity to see what was coming and decided to switch lanes at the last second. But now, we couldn’t switch over and we didn’t have time to stop, so we just kept going. Upon seeing that we didn’t plan on moving over, TD fucking loses it. He starts gesturing to his flashing lights and screaming, exactly what idk, but I made out the words “move over you stupid bitch” from reading his lips. 

At that point, I yell “Hey fuck you guy!” 

We just kinda scooted around him, but he clearly made out what I said, or he’s just a dick, because he punched the side of my gfs car. 

If I had been driving, I would’ve pulled over, so thank god I wasn’t.

Now, thinking back, it definitely wasn’t the best thing to do, but was it at least warranted?

Now complete the following example-
input: I am 17...I study in a private high school.
Kindly excuse my English, it isn't very good.

My father is a garbage man, I have been extremely fortunate to get to study here. I genuinely feel like I deserve it since I worked really hard to ace the entrance exams and competitions.
I didn't feel very welcome when I got here at first. Everyone had parents who were millionaires or had a stable income, and a lot of them distanced themselves when I told them what my father did. I considered that a blessing though, since a few gems came by. Two of them also had parents who were lower middle class like me, so I really grew connected to them. We all have been the founders the school robotics club, and represent our school. We have won several national and international level competitions.

For the past few months, we have a STEM for women or something like that initiative taken by the school. I am completely for this and like the concept.

The problem just started when an all girls robotics club was formed. They took away 80% of our funding. I argued with the cultural secretary that we should have a 50/50 split, and I myself would guide them after class. It seemed nonsensical to me, it had far fewer members.

Despite this, I planned on helping them after school, but my first interaction was extremely unpleasant. I said fuck it and left mid way when one of them insinuated I was mansplaining and they all proceeded to laugh. I told them to not expect any help from me and that they would do terribly because they weren't serious about it.

 Then the school proceeded to make them represent the school in all competitions, and they finished dead last in most. They clearly didn't know even the basics, since they had far more funding than there competitors. Their last model was just a dog shaped device that walked, taken straight from YouTube. You can make it in like 6 hours at most. They had so much funding, so it hurt me to see it all go to waste. When I told them to be passionate about it, they brushed it off.

 We had a robot which solved the Rubik's cube with half the funds.

I wrote a long letter to the headmaster about the issue and the club got closed because of it.

I personally met the ex club president, telling her to  make a club she actually liked and not waste the school's money. She apparently made a whole Instagram story about it with a crying emoji and called me a misogynistic asshole who brutally shut down her budding club before it even aquired it's wings. Something melodramatic like that. 
She is pretty popular and has almost 4000 followers, so she is making me look bad in front of all these people.
I honestly don't really get her here. I think I am not in the wrong.

Would be glad if I could have an unbiased opinion though. I have said everything as it is.

input: My aunt is almost six years clean from drugs and alcohol. Im super proud of her and have been nothing but supportive. I drive two hours each way every year to see her get her medallion and even presented her the five year one and said a brief speech.

My aunt is very much in the AA/NA mindset of one day a time, God is good, etc. I totally support this but sometimes it gets exhausting. For background, my maternal side is all alcoholics and my paternal side is a long line of drug addicts. My two ex step fathers were both addicts. This is not my first time around the block and sometimes I've just had enough with the NA speak.

My aunt also is a sponsor and all of her friends are in the program. At least once a month someone she knows dies, and she's just DEVASTATED every time. And im just like...well, yeah, that's what happens when everyone you know does drugs. Every conversation is riddled with AA-isms, mildly laced with self pity, and just so dramatic. 

So, AITA for dodging her calls and not really wanting to be much more involved than i already am?

 I like my privacy and quiet (im also autistic so need alone time to recharge) mine and my partners friends ( who we have known for years) come over now and then but never stay over.

I have suggested to her as i work in a hotel they could stay there and she can stay with them at the hotel when they visit so i have my peace and can relax. if she makes friends here as well she can visit them too and nothing wrong with her going back home to see her friends on a weekend when she isnt working.

I would also rather she introduces me to her friends away from the house so i can get used to them and see if i would be comfortable letting them in my house. 

I dont want to be mean to her i dont want my home to be a prison but i also dont want loads of people coming and going in my house. She got pretty upset about it.

input: He will probably see this but anyway, my best friends girlfriend for a year and I started talking and became really good friends last fall. He and she were the absolutly closest friends I've ever had. I've been batteling with depression for the last couple of years and I always felt that they made it better. I always made sure they were okay with talking about such a heavy topic and tried to leave room for them to take breaks. I did not want to be a depressive burden. But they were often supportive even though I explicitly told them not to do anything if they don't feel like it. I apprechiated honesty over faked support.

Fast forward to last week when I tried meeting up with his girlfriend. She made excuses and I eventually called her out and asked if she didn't want to meet. She told me she was cutting off a lot of people and that it wasn't personal. She just needed a break. I thanked her for her honesty and respected that she wanted to be alone.

Later that week she met up with another mutual friend, I asked about the cutting off and that it was hard to not take it personal when I seemed to be the only one she wanted to cut off. She told me she lied. She wanted to stop speaking with me, I started questioning if our whole friendship was built on lies. If she ever even liked me or just felt responsible to help my depression. A lot went through my head and I needed a break, I didn't wan't to think about this at all. I told my friend about it and how i'm cutting contact with him and his girlfriend to be able to focus on other things and not be anxious about my trust issues. I tried explaining and he told me to go to hell. I dont want to hurt either of them, I just feel like I need a break.

I told him earlier that week that I would be working on Friday and then heading out for the holidays the next day.

I had just been on the phone with my boss, too, and thankfully, they didn’t start while that was happening. I’m on calls with my coworkers frequently, and most of them take place over Skype, which picks up every sound.

Don’t get me wrong. My roommate can bang whomever he wants. I am supportive! But I was really irritated that he chose to do it in the middle of the morning when he knew I would be working.

I'm a digital and traditional artist and in one of my classes we create t shirts and things (socks, lanyards, water bottles, stickers, you name it). I'm a big fan of putting my art on t shirts so I can sell them.

M wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

Am I the asshole for wanting to wear the shirt I made just once?
output: wanting to wear a shirt
Positive example 2-
input: Pretty much was hanging out with two friends. I was watching the Lakers game. They won at the very last minute and I immediately hopped up and celebrated. Before I could even finish celebrating one friend started going on about how the Lakers suck. It just pissed me off so much I screamed at her to get out my room until she left. 


She knows I'm a huge fan and she likes them too. She was only saying it to antagonize me. Am I the dick here?
output: going off on a friend for making a comment about my sports team
Now complete the following example-
input: I counted up my piggy banks today. It took me about half an hour and it  came out to just over $100.

It's Saturday so my bank isn't open so I decided to go to a local head shop and try and get a new bong.

(DISCLAIMER: many of you may think im an asshole stoner, being a total chump for doing this but I'll just say it's legal some places and I thoroughly counted the coins twice while not under any kind of influence. I counted using a scale the first time and manually the second so I'm positive of the value.)

I digress. Money is money and I managed to double count in about 30 minutes, yet the cashier called me an asshole and told me to beat it as soon as I asked if they'd accept payment in coins.

$100 is nothing to sneeze at for a small time glass store and I'm honestly surprised they wouldn't take it, and the dude behind the counter was very rude about it.

So, am I the asshole for trying to spend a bunch of money in change?
output: ",trying to buy an item with $100 in coins
