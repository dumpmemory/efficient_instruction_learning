input: My boyfriend (well just call him M) and I are creators on Instagram (he is also on TikTok). I'm a digital and traditional artist and in one of my classes we create t shirts and things (socks, lanyards, water bottles, stickers, you name it). I'm a big fan of putting my art on t shirts so I can sell them.

M wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

input: Im making a throwaway account because i don't want anyone to know this and this has had a really big emotional toll on me so please be respectful in the comments. I want to know who's in the wrong but please be respectful when doing so. So i've been dating my girlfriend for a few months now and i really felt like she was the one for me. I thought we were getting married. I remember when we were dating she used to talk about how wedgies were funny and she would give me them a lot. I did it to her a couple times back and i felt it was weird she seemed to enjoy them. She would even ask me to give her them too which was even weirder. Wedgies are supposed to be a prank, they hurt and are embarrassing, definitely not enjoyable to receive one. She was giving me wedgies every time we hung out and it was getting really really annoying and i'd tell her to stop. She'd calm for a bit but then revert to it. Eventually we're hanging out and she leaves to go the bathroom. I go on her computer to look up flight tickets or something and i see a closed tab of a youtube compilation of guys getting wedgies. There was also one of guys getting wedgies on google images and thats when i realized that wedgies are some sort of weird fetish. This whole time i felt i've been violated. SHe'd only did it a couple times in public in front of my close friends or hers so it wasn't that big of a deal but now knowing she gets sexual pleasure out of it I feel like she also cheated on me when she gave my guy friends wedgies too. I told her i figured out what is going on and that her wedgie fetish is disgusting and degerneate and i can't be with someone who gets turned on by that. She starts crying and she's on her knees begging me to not leave her and give her another chance and to find a way to work things out. I leave and everyday i get missed calls and texts which I've been ignoring. I'm considering maybe giving her a second chance but idk. AITA here? all my friends think so and her friends have been harassing me nonstop, i had to block them all on social media. Should i give me gf another chance or did she violate me? I really feel if the gender roles were swapped I would be considered the asshole

Now complete the following example-
input: So I often drink a couple of beers after work to wind down (not every day, but it’s a normal thing for me). Tonight I was watching tv and my son asked if he could try some. I held the bottle and let him have a small sip. I thought he might spit it out but he just kind of made a small face and that was it. 

My wife was right there when it happened and she gets this horrified look on her face. I say “he just had a small sip”. She said nothing and ends up putting our son down to bed and proceeds to let me have it in a the weird hushed/scream voice she uses when she’s upset but wants to be quiet. 

She said she thought for sure I would tell him no when he asked and she can’t believe I gave him alcohol. I explained why I didn’t think it was a big deal but she’s still pretty angry. I guess I’ve always been more easygoing when it comes to parenting...

Anyway I’m just wondering if what I did sounds so terrible to the average person. I mean, it’s not like I let him chug the whole bottle! I figured he was just curious about the taste, and now he knows. Literally one sip and that was it. (Although if you ask my wife she’ll say he had a “gulp” of it). 

So was I the asshole in this situation? (Using a throwaway because I post in other parenting subs on my main, and I don’t want any judginess spilling over).

Now complete the following example-
input: So my friend and I have been super close for like five years now, but living together for only a year.  In that one year though I've grown to not like his behavior.

We run with a very tight knit group that all know who the type of person he is, and when you don't see him as much, is a great guy.  But he's had a history of changing how he acts based on friends we have hanging around us.  When he's around those people he begins to insult me and my other roommate, who's also a close friend of ours.

We've told him before how we don't appreciate him insulting us, especially when he doesn't do that to his other friends.  His response was just that he didn't mean it to be rude, he just thought since we were close he could.  Even though we don't ""joke"" back.

But there was a part where he crossed a line for me.

I work with kids, so naturally he thinks it's funny to call me a pedophile.  Not only to other friends, one who also works with me, but his online friends (he games)  that I've never met.  I tell him to not do that, and he persists.

I'm also very close to someone with a kid.  And one night I was playing with the child, in front of the friend.  The child wanted to play foot doctor and asked me to take off my shoe and sock.  I thought I was cute so I recorded the interaction and put it on a social media story.

He then puts me in a group chat with a friend of ours, and then goes on ask me why I have videos of little girls playing with my feet.  And saying that he thought it was creepy.  He knows that girl and my relation to the mother and that's where I drew the line.

I told him to go fuck himself and have yet to talk to him again.  I've let other people know that I'm currently not on good terms with him and they have essentially said ""that's just how he jokes"" and made me out to be the bad guy for being stuck up and sensitive about it.

I don't think it's personally funny, especially when it's the child of a very good friend of mine.

AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: My daughter is 9 and just started going to a new school in January because we moved. It is a public school in an urban city which is quite multicultural. She is half-Chinese and half-white. Although she is part Chinese, not many people can notice. Some have thought that she is Italian or Greek or even Irish for some reason.

Anyways, a month and a bit ago, my daughter came home a bit sad. I asked her what was wrong and she told me that in school, everyone shared what they did for the weekend. My daughter said that her family is Chinese so they celebrated Chinese New Year. The teacher (who is white) apparently told her “But you’re not Chinese. You shouldn’t lie.” My daughter said she felt embarassed in front of the whole class.

I was amused but also angry. I phoned her teacher and VERY CASUALLY told her that my daughter felt hurt by her being dismissive of her heritage. Her teacher was strangely defensive and asked me if I was accusing her of something. I said no and just that she should try being more open minded. 

A few days after this incident, my daughter said she felt like the teacher was treating her unfairly, namely refusing to let her go to the water fountain during class, giving her a “time out” for not lining up in time for recess, putting her on the spot to answer a question and berating her when she had the wrong answer. This time both my husband and I booked an appt to talk with the teacher, who was quite dismissive of us and very unhelpful. 

At this point it was affecting my daughter’s enjoyment of school. She would cry at night and beg me to send her back to her old school. Finally I had a talk with the principal, who told me that other parents have been accusing the teacher of racism in the past and said they’re trying to work with her. In the meantime my daughter was transferred to another class which worked out great.

Flash forward to last week when I was picking up my daughter from school. Her old teacher approached me and we made a bit of small talk, then she said casually, “Well Im not going to return to teach next year so I guess I can thank you.”

I was super taken aback. I told her I did NOT mean for her to lose her job. She then walked away from me.

I also learned from another parent that she was 4 kids and is a single mom. This made me extremely sad and I can’t help but feel guilty for playing a role in having her fired. My husband told me she was probably gonna get fired anyways and said I shouldn’t feel bad.

AITA though? I feel so so horrible knowing that she cannot support her 4 kids anymore partially because of my complaint against her.

input: I really can’t tell if I was being too insensitive or not. 

A few friends and I were invited to play some touch football at the beach one day with some random people we met who were throwing around a football. After a while we were getting out of breath from all the activity and one of the guys made a joke saying something like “I’m going to end up tearing my other ACL.”

He talked a bit about it a bit later on telling us how he tore his ACL in high school and how it sucked.

After a while of playing, we all getting very tired and almost falling over. I ended up tripping myself out of fatigue when running for the ball and said something along the lines of “I better watch out or I’ll end up tearing my ACL.”

After saying that, the guy who tore his ACL started to criticize me about how tearing an ACL is a serious thing and shouldn’t be joked about.

I understand tearing an ACL is serious but this guy seemed perfectly fine playing the game and I thought it wasn’t too serious of a thing for him since he was making a joke about it earlier. AITA?

I asked him to get out, and my memory is not perfect but it led to him punching me in the face. I got angry and punched him in the shoulder. He looked aghast and told me that I had to move out by tomorrow because he didn't want to son like me. I'm going to talk to him tomorrow and hope that we can come to some sort of compromise.

Now complete the following example-
input: So I just recently found this subreddit and figured I would share my story from a couple of years ago.

I was in the cinema with some friends watching Super Bowl. Patriots vs Falcons. We had booked our seats several weeks prior in order to get the best possible seats just below the walking area, so we could just jump down instead of having to go all the way around and inconvinience people.

When we got there some guy had taken the very center seat and refused to move. So after several minutes of confrontations and threatening with getting the usher he finally moved a couple of seats to the side. But before he could move he ""accidentally"" spilled cola on my seat. Now I spent the first quarter of the game sitting on a soaking wet seat. This was so fucking frustrating and I had a hard time enjoying myself for what is a fun night of tradition with my friends.

Patriots were really far behind and this guy was an annoyance constantly making hand signatures and grunting whenever the refs would make ""a wrong call"". We are roughly down to 5 minutes of the first half and Patriots are behind with 20-25 points and this guy goes out to get some drinks before the halftime show. As he goes away I prepare my revenge.

He had locked his seat so he could jump down instead of going around. I however had noticed this and decided to unlock his seat so it would go back and forwards whenever you move in the seat. He comes back with a very big cola and as he steps into his seat he gets surprised about it not being locked, he trips and spills his drink all over himself while me, my friends and a good chunk of the cinema burst out laughing.

He ends up leaving, presumably to go get cleaned up, however he never returned, which I figure was due to his team losing badly.

Well for people who remember Patriots overcame a 25 points deficit and managed to win in the biggest Super Bowl comeback in history and this guy missed it all because he had to spill drinks on a seat he didn't even pay for in the first place. 

I ended up feeling like an asshole but at the same time it felt so good after having to sit on a soaking seat for almost 5 hours.

Anyway, I'm in a local LGBTQ+ WhatsApp group and we talk about many different issues, so I tried to talk about my concerns.

I immediately get blasted by a guy who tells me that I ""should have more respect because dysphoria and similar issues can't be self-diagnosed"" and that he ""got diagnosed with them by professionals"".

That made me feel kinda bad, because I was just trying to open up about my personal experience with a group I thought I could trust and that could relate with me, nothing else.

input: we're both 24 and been together for 2 years, and I just got promoted to a very stressful role in software sales in July and the amount of stress of having to hit targets/quotas per quarter is insane and it was giving me crazy anxiety and making me really sad. I've been feeling this way since I got into the software sales industry out of college because of having to hit quotas but now with the promotion its even more stress. But the thing is that I hold it all in from my GF, family and friends and I sometimes just cry in the shower. I don't want to seem weak to my GF and complain about my job to my parents so I just deal with it, but its been fucking me up mentally so badly. 

I started seeing a therapist in December and its been helping a good amount, I've made some good progress and she has experience working with people dealing with high amounts of work stress. I get reminded of my appts, which are once a week for 1 hour by text message 24 hours in advance and on Sunday mid day my GF was over and I got the text reminder about my appt on monday at 4. My GF saw this and googled the name of the therapist and found everything out, when I was in the shower and when I got out she was furious for not telling her anything and going behind her back seeing a therapist and she was yelling at me a lot saying how could I keep this from her and calling me an ass for hiding it. I just broke down crying and apologized a lot saying I didn't know how to tell her but I was going to one day. She's been very dry and mad at me since and wants to take a break.

she didn’t take it very well, and is now ignoring me whenever she sees me. i’ve gotten mixed reactions from my friends about ending it too, saying i should have just gone through with it if i actually loved her. others are proud of me for ending if for both me and my ex’s sake. i’m feeling guilty about it, even though i found out she had been cheating on me with one of my best friends (who didn’t know we were still dating and apologized a ton) while she dated me.

input: Okay, so I, a 13-year-old, work small jobs for money. Rake some leaves for a neighbour for 5 dollars, mow the lawn for another 5. Really simple jobs that give me some money to buy what I want. So we were at the mall, and I wander off with 10 dollars and went to Subway. I buy a simple Meatball Marinara for 6.00, and some chips for a dollar. With 3 dollars left, I decided to save them and go to find my mom who is sitting in the playground area with my brother sitting right next to her. I promptly sat myself next to her, and began to eat my food. My brother started whining about how he was hungry, so I instinctively went and handed him my bag of chips. But; this didn't satisfy him. He started CRYING about how he wanted a sandwich.

Now; my brother REFUSES to eat any sandwich other than the Turkey Italiano Melt(T.I.M), which is 6.75. I only had 3 dollars. 

Now, the wining PISSED my mom off. (Keep in mind this is my biological mom, who I see a few times a year. I have a way better stepmom)  She DEMANDED I buy him a sandwich. I explain he only eats the T.I.M, and I didn't have the money for it. Angrily she hands me about 5 dollars, and I take my brother to buy it. I'm staying at her house for the weekend (right now im in the closet because its the only place I can get away from both of them. Its a small house, and me and my brother share a room here.) and shes actually pissed at me for not being able to buy my brother a sandwich even though it was my own money I earned??? AITA???

Now complete the following example-
input: So some backstory, in my English class we are studying a text by a Nigerian women, it's basically a collection of short stories with there own characters focused around the lives on women in Africa during certain events.

We where given the essay topic

""Jumping monkey hill highlights the pressures women are placed under at the hands of men"".

I chose to do the thing that every other teacher at my school recommends and agree/disagree not completely either. So I said that yes it does show that but it also shows how men can be placed under that same pressure. (As it does, it's about a group of people at a writing conference (men and women) and the old man running it is a pedophile who harras some of the women, the story rather clearly shows the men feel pressure not to say any thing as the man can provide them with opportunity. (Very clear).

I got my essay back and the teacher *corrected* my intention to be that women as supposed to what I originally said ""jumping monkey hill explores how women are pressured by those around them, however it also highlights that men can face the same pressure""

She ""corrected"" it to not include the bit about men. 

When she came over and asked me (and the rest of the table) if we had any questions about our feedback. I in no uncertain way said that I think she's wrong, and that the point of a contention is to state your interpretation, my interpretation was that and she has no right to edit that contention if it's completely related to the essay topic as it was. 

Everyone at my table seemed to think I was being rude and sexist for pointing that out.... 

This was a practise essay but I just got the three options for our assessed essay and all three focus exclusively on women (although the story does explore things like religion, race, war, politics, immigrants and so much else) even things that could super easily be multi gender she's chosen to say only happen to women. 

Am I the asshole for choosing to disagree with these topics all going along how women are the victims ect ect.

*I'm not sexism I believe in just testing everyone the same, if gender isn't needed to make a point (and imo the only time it is is when talking about physical differences) I just don't think you should make things about gender, if she was doing the same thing about men my response would be the same.*

input: I have been a long-time lurker on my main account but created a throwaway to post because I don't know if my GF uses Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

This happened during break, and it's really been weighing on me. 

A few days ago, my GF and I had planned to hang out, but the day of, she said she couldn't make it because she needed to help a family member move.

We are kind of long-distance couple: I only come back home on the weekends, so hanging out is tricky for us. She also hangs out with her friends on the weekends as well and not during the week. (This comes up later in the story).

This wasn't the first time this had happened; it happened once three months back as well but she said that she was with a family member atm. So I was kind of upset that this had happened twice in a row, so I told her how I felt. We don't really have that many chances to hang out because of my weekend constraint, and most times when I try to set up a date, she's been busy. However, she hangs out with her friends on the weekends once or twice a month. We've planned out three dates, and have only been on one.

During our conversation, I also brought up how we had only hung out once during our entire relationship (5 months now), but she had hung out with her friends 3 times in the past two weeks. After that, she's been distant, and this morning, she told me that she was upset that I brought her friends into the conversation.

I felt like I was trying to make a point that she wasn't spending as much time with me, but AITA for bringing it up? Am I just jealous?

I will clarify if you guys need additional info.

input: About two weeks ago, I decided to try going vegan. I didn’t eat a lot of meat before so it wasn’t a hard change for me. I can’t tell you why I decided to go completely vegan all together. It’s just something I wanted to try so I did it. And I really enjoyed it. I’m having a lot of fun planning creative meals and buying interesting produce. I also like the way my body feels. I no longer feel heavy or bloated after meals. 

My boyfriend and I are both 25 and we have been together for six and a half years, and living together for five of those. He is a serious carnivore. When I chose to change my diet, I tried my best for it not to affect him. I made him steaks and chicken to “supplement” my dinners. I bought him regular cows milk and regular butter. If he doesn’t want to go vegan, I understand and I won’t make him.  

Last night we went to dinner at one of our favorite bars and he wanted to stop for ice cream at his favorite place on the way home. I suggested that we stop at the grocery store instead (same parking lot) so that I could get some dairy-free ice cream instead. He did it, but it the most passive aggressive way possible. He glared at me and stormed off as I was trying to pick out what flavor I wanted. It was frustrating, but I just tried to brush it off. When we got home, he went to the garage to work on his boat and then went to bed without me. (Granted, he is exhausted from three weeks work with no breaks) 

This morning I sensed he was still upset and I asked him about it. He said he couldn’t understand my diet change and it was upsetting him. He didn’t want me to do this forever and he would be embarrassed to tell his friends and family. He said it would be okay if I were just vegetarian but vegan is too much. 

I did do this without talking to him about it first, but if I had talked to him first I feel like he would have tried to talk me out of it. I also don’t know if I’m going to do this forever, but I also can’t give an end date... 

AITA for going vegan without consulting my boyfriend? 

TL;DR: I went vegan and I liked it. My carnivorous boyfriend is now embarrassed of me and gets upset when I eat.

When he’s on and I’m on at the same time, we’ll usually play something together with a few other friends. 

Question:

Sometimes I’ll be doing something like playing a different game, practicing guitar, or hanging out and watching T.V and he’ll be like, “wow always gotta do what you want to do, and not anything I want to do”. Kind of makes me feel bad. My question here is, should I be dropping everything to play with him whenever he wants? We used to play different genres a while back, but I got bored and returned to our main game. Other than that, I rarely really like to play other games, because we have different interests, and I thought I don’t really domineer his choices with mine at all. If it’s a game I enjoy and I’m not doing anything, I’ll hop on. If it’s not, I might depending on the game and if I’m not busy. Recently I think I’m in this mindset where, if i want to play something then I’ll get on it, and if he doesn’t want to then cool, that’s fine. People have different interests. AITA?

My dad has been in and out of jail and I rarely have got to see him or have a relationship. 

I'd like to have some photos but my mom won't let me even take any of her photos to a Walgreens Photo Center to get them copied. 

I understood when I was a minor that if it was her rule that I did not have my own photos of him for whatever reason then I had to listen even if I thought it was weird (they're ""her photos"" was and is always what she says. I can look at them in photo albums but can't have any of my own copies), but now I am adult and I think it is unreasonable that she not let me have photos of my dad because seriously wtf? 

Basically what I want to do is temporarily steal the photos and just get them coppied myself without her permission. I know stealing is wrong and you can't just take people's stuff and do whatever you want with it because you feel entitled to... But I feel really really entitled to this? Is my entitlement justified enough to break this general rule?

Now complete the following example-
input: Before I start, here's a quick apology for my somewhat poor English. ( It isn't my native language.)

First some backstory: Whenever our school schedules match up, I ride back home with one or two friends. Let's call them girl A and boy B. I am good friends with both of them, but they despise eachother. Most of the time I flip a coin and decide who of the two I go home with. Today it was girl A, she asked me to meet up with her at the lockers after the sixth hours and from there on go home. She didn't show up and thus I biked home with boy B.

Turns out the girl quickly grabbed her and her boyfriend's coat so they could quickly get away without anyone else noticing. But I asked some other friends and they told me she was already gone.

But girl A just so happens to live somewhere on my way home. Me and boy B were having a laugh  and thought of a 'prank' we could pull on her. The prank was moving her, locked, bike and then slowly send her more and more pictures of the bike eventually revealing it's location. Turns out her bike was in the garage but her boyfriends was still on the driveway. So we took his bike instead.

We sent a picture of the bike every 30 minutes or so, but it turned out none of the two looked at their phone the 3+ hours they were together. ( or they just didn't open our messaged idk) Next day we told them about what we thought was a funny thing to do. But they got really pissed at us. I told them it was just a joke and there were no bad feelings or anything. But alas they were still annoyed. I asked her how long they looked for the bike and she replied with: 'idk, my mom looked for it.'

It's now another day later and they're still pissed at us. I really don't think it's that bad of a prank to pull and they don't really have any reason to be upset since they didn't even search for it themselves. This might al be my misguided opinion, hence I'm writing this post.

So reddit please help me out, AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: Hey there! Thanks, first of all, thank you for taking the time to read this.

&amp;#x200B;

I was in a Long Distance Relationship with this cute girl from the opposite hemisphere for 4 years and a half, we talked every day for hours at an end, I helped her through some really awful times in her life as well through some very suicidal months, likewise, she helped me through some awful times of mine.

She suffers from some mental illnesses and she was taking medication for that as well as some other things, I encouraged her on anti-depressants due to her family situation, where she was not abused, but one of her parents is terminally ill and she cares for them.

Recently before the break up, I had been busy due to being close to graduation from the military academy, but I still did my best to be with her despite everything and we were happy, until she started to grow distant more and more, being depressed for seemingly no reason, and spending less time with me. I was devastated, but tried to understand her and still was there with her, I had bought an airplane ticket to go visit her, and so it was set, I logged onto my computer to tell her I had requested leave for a while, and had bought a ticket to go visit her.

That day, before I could even tell her, she  dumped me with a massive text wall that was unlike her writing at all,  claiming she was just not attracted to me anymore, trust me - you know somebody's writing style after 4 years of chatting with somebody over voice and text, and acted extremely could, although we stayed ""best friends"" since we both cared for each other

I burned the ticket in a fit of emotion, which sucked in hindsight, I could have at least gone sightseeing or something.

A little less than two weeks later, she told me she has got a new group of partners (We were monogamous, although she flirted with the idea of being poly once) and spoke to me about them, they seemed extremely manipulative at times and not very attached to her, she introduced me to them a few times through multiple opportunities, and they were quite harsh and respectful of me.

Her entire family, she told me, is around ""15 or more"" people, she isn't even sure, but she claimed to be happy, from what little we speak, she seems to be growing erratic and I'm concerned she might have been encouraged by them to go off her meds or something.

&amp;#x200B;

So reddit, AITA for all of this? I can't help but feel bad for being unable to let go of her or something, and maybe that I'm just paranoid over her new partners or something.

During the movie we occasionally laughed at the funny scenes and kissed a bit during the romantic scenes. After the movie ended we were about to leave, then the husband of the family gets up and approaches us. He says ""You guys need to shut the f*** up"". Mind you his daughters were there too maybe 9-12 yrs old. And literally walks away. My girlfriend and I were shocked and didn't say a word. During the movie this man did not even ask us to be quiet. Later we walked into the lobby and the man is just staring at us. The wife later makes a comment and says ""my daughters behavior was better than yours"". We both just walked away and did not want to escalate the situation. Later me and my gf just talked about it for a bit. Although she didn't seem too bothered I thought that it kinda ruined the mood the rest of the date. AITA in this situation?

input: My wife and I are going through some shit, that's not the issue. 

We have an agreement that when she went out with friends she'd be allowed to make out with guys/girls and have fun. There's only a few rules involved: 1) don't be stupid and put yourself in unsafe situations, 2) must be one and done, no repeats 3) don't forget you have a husband.

So she came home one night after going out with friends, and everything was fine, until she called me another guy's name mid sex.

Then I find out she's continued to Snapchat him.

I asked for one of two things to happen. 1) that she cut all ties with him, or 2) tell him she's married. Both of which she refused to do on the basis that ""he's not from here and I'll never *see* him again"" I lost my cool and the argument ensued where I was told I was overreacting.

AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: I (28F) have a number of friends who are on a particular fad diet. They've had great experiences and like to talk about that with our larger friend group, myself included. I have no inclination to try this diet, but I'm happy that my friends are happy.

I am on the thicker side so I've dealt with people making passive aggressive comments about diets my whole life. Enough people have outright told me I need to diet so much that I've developed a sensitivity to any talk of diets, thinking they might be a comment on my weight.

I am healthy and am happy with my weight, but this wasn't always the case. I was diagnosed with EDNOS (catchall term for eating disorders that aren't anorexia/bulimia) when I was younger, and I'm currently working with my therapist to manage my mental health as I take care of myself physically. One of the steps for this has been focusing on overall health over exact weight, and I don't actually know how much I weigh know since I've avoided a scale for so long. I feel better than I did a few years ago, so to me, that's good enough.

However, when one of my friends says things like ""I can't eat this, I only have 20 carbs left for the day"" or ""\[Mutual friend\] is doing well, she says she lost 3 pounds last week"", I go to a bad mental place. If this comes up while we're eating, I'll immediately stop. I feel sick and feel an overwhelming urge to harm myself to get rid of my excess weight.

WIBTA if I asked my friends to stop talking about this diet around me, especially the parts with numbers? I'm afraid of it seeming like jealousy (and on some level I wonder if I am just jealous) but it's hurting me to hear it.

Now complete the following example-
input: I met this friend online 2 years ago, hit it off immediately like we were long lost sisters, I love her but we're the same person almost down to a T, both dealing with mental health issues as well as physical. We naturally bonded and talked almost everyday, got into a huge fight where I was admittedly the asshole for blowing up on her and a mutual friend, eventually we made up and last year we started talking again. My friend (who I'll call A for convenience) sometimes mentioned a guy, but we didn't talk about that too much since she's really reserved about her personal life, which I understand, but sometimes get a bit offended with since I'm super open about my personal problems (like I'm being now I guess). 

&amp;#x200B;

One day her ex hit me up on twitter. I'd tweeted something about MBTI and he loves that thing so we talked the entire night about that. I mentioned her bc she also liked MBTI and he said he should send her his regards since they hadn't talked in a while and that he missed her, and I didn't think much of it (this will be relevant later). It appeared to me he was a bit flirty and I have to admit he ticked some of my boxes - he's incredibly well-spoken (which at my age is rare) and has a weird sense of humor, a bit of dad jokes mixed in with dark humor, not to mention liking some of my favorite movies and anime. It was a pleasant night of talking, nothing happened because I had an idea there'd been something going on between him and A and didn't want to stick my foot in that. Also I wasn't so incredibly attracted to him that I'd risk a friendship over that (well, guess what!)

&amp;#x200B;

I was a bit conflicted and told our mutual friend that T (her ex) had hit me up and that I'd enjoyed talking to him. I asked if  I should tell A, since I didn't want to go behind her back, especially since we were on good terms now. My friend said I should say something just to get it off my mind, so I did. A has the weirdest reaction ever, like she was clapping at a really elaborate comedy shtick which just left me kind of dumbfounded. She laughed super hard about it and I decided to play along, told her that we didn't talk about much of anything. A asked if I'd mentioned her. I said yes, because of MBTI, and said he'd told me he missed her and was going to hit her up. She said that wasn't possible, since she'd blocked him a year ago... I just thought that was weird and didn't think much of it, but she kept talking about how manipulative he was and how he was such a disgusting person who ruined her life and manipulated her for years to his benefit. I was starting to lean toward him being an asshole. But then I kept talking to him and he was always super nice to me; a superficial kind of nice, but nice nonetheless. From a rational point of view, he hadn't done anything to me, so why should I hate him? 

&amp;#x200B;

We kept talking but not for long. I guess the combination of A talking shit about him with me and him being aware that we knew each other and we talked made for a weird atmosphere. I don't regret it much, but I like being on good terms with people. We didn't stop talking because of what A said about him, just there wasn't much interest on my part (he kept replying to my instagram stories and complimenting me, so I guess he was a bit attracted but I can't say for sure). 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, A was never open about what happened between them, despite my insistence. I insist because I don't want to hate someone just from what my friends say; while I understand sometimes they are right to be mad, I also think there are always two sides to the story, and so I'm usually skeptical, even when they tell me the whole story. I hate being unfair to people just because someone pretty much ordered me to, which is kind of what happened. She started to become increasingly paranoid about me and him, asking if we were talking much and what we were talking about. A bit of backstory: T and A had known each other for some 4 years I think and they dated for two weeks. They never met in real life, he was an asshole to her, pretty much manipulating a naive girl into sending him nudes and being there for him while he went around flirting with other girls. I KNOW he was shitty, which is why I didn't want to get very involved with him, but I also didn't want to be outright a bitch (or a white knight I guess). 

&amp;#x200B;

So one day T says ""hey we need to talk"", and I get a bit scared. He says I probably know that it's about A. He tells me he tried to talk to her, which I know because she showed me: he was super casual saying he missed her and she basically told him to fuck off and that she never wants him in her life again, saying how after they broke up he'd hit on her best friend and now he was doing the same thing to me just to get to her. Well, I don't want to be the one to say it but IT DID GET TO HER. I sent a print of the ""hey we need to talk"" bit to the group chat I had with A and our mutual friend. I had stuff to do so didn't deliver (also bc I was nervous about A's reaction since he'd pretty much trash talked her to me after the initial message). A asked ""where's the rest? can you send the prints?"" and I kept postponing it until she lost it and pretty much bullied me into showing her the convo. I said I didn't want to because it was going to hurt her, and she said she had the right to be hurt. I almost had a panic attack bc she wouldn't stop blowing up my phone. Before you say it, yes I know I messed up here and it was natural that she wanted to see the prints, but I told her what he'd said in them (albeit in a much nicer way since T was really a bitch to her). She wouldn't stop pressuring me to give her the damn convo, so I said fuck it, if you want to let your ex who you dated for 2 weeks affect you this much then be my fucking guest. Btw I tried to defend her in the prints, saying I understood why she blocked him and didn't want to talk to him. I wasn't SUPER WHITE KNIGHTE-Y about it, because I wanted to hear his side. Yes, the side of an abuser, I know I know. So after she saw the prints she said she didn't want to talk to me again about T or anything for a while and left the group chat. I didn't go after her, but I went into a panic that night, talking to my best friends trying to understand what exactly had happened. She usually insisted I show her my convos with him, meanwhile I never showed him any convos with her... Because he just didn't care. Now if you ask me, A has a great boyfriend now so I really don't understand how this affects her so much. I've also never had a boyfriend, but I have talked to my share of almost-boyfriends online, so I know how to spot a manipulative asshole and cut them right off. A didn't and she suffered for it. I suffered the first time, then I learned to get over it. 

&amp;#x200B;

To sum up, A tried to talk to me again for a while, but I accidentally mentioned his name twice and she said she couldn't do it anymore so she left mid-conversation. I think she overreacted a lot, especially for someone who seemed to be so close to me. Btw I haven't talked to T since November when all of this stuff happened. Now I know how much of an asshole he is, but only because another friend who knew him told me since she wouldn't open up about it. A wished me a merry xmas to which I replied ""merry xmas to you too, but when are you going to reply to me?"". Took her some 10 days to reiterate that she was offended and couldn't understand how I could do that to her, and that maybe we really weren't compatible after all. She might be right...

&amp;#x200B;

So, reddit, am I the asshole for not taking her at her word and talking to him regardless? (Or also, am I the asshole for taking printscreens and posting them to the group chat? Actually I am, and I know that one, so don't mention it, I've learned my lesson.)

M wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

Now complete the following example-
input: On Monday I woke up at 5:30 AM and noticed my phone was not charging. Immediately went to go see if my charger was plugged in, and smelt something burning. Turns out, my charger was melting and my pillow was smoking, which I assume means I was minutes away from a devastating electrical fire. All is well, and the situation was handled. 

My mother happened to text me later in the day and asked me how I’m doing. I said well, and then told her about what happened to me. She said that she’s glad I’m okay, and followed up with several questions about what I’m going to do about the situation (alert my building/landlord, charge my phone elsewhere, etc.). 

After we had settled those things l, I communicated to her that I felt lucky and that I must have good karma. She followed it up with, “that, and I pray for you everyday 😘”

Now, for a bit of back story. She raised me catholic, and both of us have hit a series of crossroads with our faith. I’m soon to be 24, and have decided over the past 2 years that I’m definitely an atheist. Being raised in that environment, it always seemed like I could never mention that, so I attended church silently and never said anything about it despite my deep down feeling that it’s all bullshit. 

She got remarried in 2010, and is incredibly involved in her church community. She is no longer Catholic, she just “reads her bible and tries to love people.”

She’s aware that I think religion is crap, however she refuses to have a conversation with me about it. Despite these facts, she continues to drop off comments like the one above, which I interpret as a deliberate attempt to have me force the conversation. 

Well, I wasn’t in a very good mood so I replied and told her that in a religion where being humble and modest are virtues, it’s incredibly arrogant to think that **your** prayers saved my ass from being turnt to ashes, as well as communicating that I can tell it bothers her that I don’t believe in God.

Needless to say, it didn’t go over that well and she didn’t reply to me after I accused her of trying to bait me into a conversation about it endlessly.

Reddit, do I need to apologize, and AITA for calling her arrogant?

input: My gf decided to drive to a trivia night at a local bar and was not going to drink so she could drive home. 

As sometimes happens to us all, she ended up drinking and could not drive home. I received a call whilst in my car asking me to come and pick her and her car up and drive her home. 

I said no, because I would have to drive home, get an Uber out to the bar (20 mins away), it was late and I had just finished work. 

I immediately offered to come pick her up. I would always do that, no questions asked, no matter where she is, to ensure that she is safe. But she refused saying she didn’t want to go back to the bar in the morning to pick up her car. 

I said that is what I was offering, take it or leave it. And that she got herself in that situation because she shouldn’t have driven if she was going to drink. 

She called me an asshole. Am I?

Now complete the following example-
input: I live in an apartment building in downtown Philly. I've lived here for more than five years so I'm used to city life and I don't expect it to be quiet. I'm used to the sounds of traffic, sirens, and drunk assholes shouting outside (mostly on the weekends) but a 24-hour convenience store and sandwich shop recently opened up right across the street from where I live and the level of drunk shouting and screaming has gone through the fucking roof. It's really bad, you guys.



Packs of drunk assholes chanting Eagles chants at the top of their lungs for twenty minutes at a time and getting in the street, blocking traffic, making drivers trying to go past lay on their horns at two am is something I can handle on weekends because I don't have to work but its EVERY GODDAMN NIGHT and it's killing me.



Sure my apartment is in a somewhat busy area but it was relatively peaceful until that convenience store came in and attracted all of the people who left bars at closing drunk off their ass but who don't want to go home yet. I tried looking up the non-emergency police number but that number is basically only open during regular day/office hours. And I don't see what my apartment management or the convenience store can do about it because these people are technically not in the store when their screaming at the top of their goddamn lungs in the middle of the street.



What I want to do is fill up a bunch of water balloons and keep them in a bowl in my fridge so they're nice and cold and throw them at the shouting people to try to get them to stop. Even if it doesn't get them to stop entirely, I have to think it would make them leave the area at least. I would only do this if it's past 1 am mon-thurs and I would use those mini balloons so no one gets soaked or anything, I don't want to damage anyone's property or anything, just give them a splash of cold water as kind of a friendly 'shut the *fuck* up, mofo'. I just honestly have no idea what else I can do to change the situation that will actually enact some form of change.



So if this is an asshole move, let me know but also let me know what else if anything I can do, I'm seriously at my wit's end.

input: My 4th hour science class is my least favorite class. I always feel like I’m an outsider from the pre established groups of students. My opinion is never taken into account when looking at things that involve me. The biggest example of this is when the entire class had an debate on how to pronounce my name and no one listened to me pronounce my name. So flash forward to Friday December 7th. My birthday is on Saturday December 8th. So during the last five minutes of class my teacher reminded us about my birthday. So the entire class attempted to sing happy birthday. I finally had enough when I heard the many ways people attempted to pronounce my name. I grabbed my things and walked out of the classroom.  I know I should have asked to use my pressure pass but I was just thinking in the heat of the moment. The entire song felt like nobody was being genuine and just wanted to get through the day. In fact that was the only time anyone mentioned my birthday for the rest of the day. I still wonder if my actions were valid at the time or should I apologize to everyone for walking out.

Now complete the following example-
input: Okay so context! My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.

Fast forward to last week when he lets me know that it’s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i’m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he’s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i’m now aware that he’s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that’s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.

Now here’s the big issue. I’ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It’s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it’s just plain weird to me. I’ve cried about it all week because I can’t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.

I tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn’t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don’t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it’s something I need to deal with on my own. It’s killing our relationship because he now says I should’ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.

Am I the asshole?

input: To start this off, I will go ahead and say the other person is definitely not the asshole in this situation. The person I made the joke to, a friend of mine, had lost her mom a few months ago and I made the mistake, but I still feel like an asshole for it because of her reaction.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, I was hanging out with a group of friends and we all went out to dinner. At some point or another, the person I had accidentally made this joke to asked me some question, I don't remember what they said, but I responded with ""your mom."" The second it came out of my mouth, I processed what I was saying and who I said it to, and automatically apologized, but she was reasonably pissed off and sad due to her situation. I don't really expect her to forgive me or anything, but it would be great. I don't know really what I could do further to make it any better, but I just don't want to hurt her too much, you know?

input: I'm in an LGBTQ organization for students at my college. There's someone in an officer position that's been a terrible person to most of our officer base.  This is a completely unpaid student organization. This will not impact anyone's livelihood. 

Context: 
-They are the only straight officer and they're known for making super inappropriate jokes about race and sexuality. When confronted they refuse to apologize, and continue making jokes at our expense.
- They blew up on the group chat one night calling an officer a bitch for asking why they were opening the conversation aggressively. At the meeting they called us to because of this they said we ignored them when they brought up issues, but every time they did it was as a joke.
- On multiple occasions this person has spoken to our members and told them that other officers don't deserve their positions 
-Some of us are physically threatened by them and it's to the point where we dont want to bring up issues. 

They have never apologised for anything they've done. When we being up serious issues to this straight person who's thrown slurs at someone and tells our officer base that we ""look too queer to talk to administration"", all we get is ""oh okay"" or ""alright"".
This person claims that they will try harder but theres been no change and recently they jumped way over our heads to start talking to some people outside of the school without our permission.

I want to talk to a member of the organization to see if they'd run against this person at our upcoming election. The dude technically does their job but they make everyone super uncomfortable and multiple people want to quit because of their presence.

Now complete the following example-
input: My youngest brother is 12, doesn’t have a phone due to losing everything and just not being responsible in general. Everyday at 2:30pm I pick him up from school and every other day I take him to and pick him up from karate 5-6pm. My parents insist I do this because they are either at work or just got home from work when he needs rides. My other brother works from 3-6 after school and can’t give him rides either. The thing is his school is 0.7 miles from our house and karate is 0.2!! Literally down a block and a half from our house. My mom insists he needs rides because it’s too cold and night, and he used to have a big instrument from school but he doesn’t anymore and definitely can walk. 

Yesterday was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Ever since I started picking him up, a year ago, he never looks for my car. If I’m not right up front, he waits around where I generally can’t see him, then walks home. His school is BUSY and I have come and park 15-20minutes early just so he sees my car. If I have to park across the street he won’t even look. Once I drove in circles trying to get him to notice and even yelled out the window and he just kept walking. 
This happens way too often. Yesterday I waited 25 minutes just to get a call that he walked home from karate. This was the 2nd time in a row this happened. I was only 2 cars from the entrance (parked facing it so maybe only 25ft or less) but a truck blocked my view and I could not see if he was there. 

When I got home I was livid, I pay for my own gas and I waste SO much just driving to get him for no reason. And in the winter I leave my car on so I don’t freeze, making me waste even more gas. I told my parents I’m not giving him rides anymore, he can walk. They went on and on about how they can’t give him rides and it’s not a big deal. They didn’t even tell him to look for my car, they said it wasn’t his fault. I just don’t understand how many times can this happen before he looks for my car for once. He’s not an idiot but wow I get so mad because he can’t get simple stuff like this in his head. 

When I got home later that night I was told he was upset and it’s my fault. I didn’t even talk to him, I just told my parents I’m done with this ridiculous and not giving rides anymore. Apparently he overheard and is upset because I was being a jerk??  

Anyway today my mom went to pick him up, GUESS WHAT HE DIDNT LOOK FOR HER. And she ended up just leaving and he walked home. She said he can walk now but is still mad at me for not giving him rides??? 

TLDR; my brother walks home when I try to give him rides because he doesn’t look for my car, but I’m the jerk for not wanting to waste my time/money anymore.

input: I don’t like my parents bugging me so much about my grades. Maybe if they weren’t always so pushy about it, possibly I’d actually care about my grades. Now, not saying my grades are bad, but like, I don’t like them constantly checking my grades. Isn’t a progress report every 6 weeks plenty? Thing is, my dad sorta works at the HS I go to.

Yeah.

It’s incredibly irritating to me, and I don’t like my parents getting involved in it, simply as I’m a rather reserved person. I’m strict about people touching my phone. I don’t like people on my laptop. Etc.

Now complete the following example-
input: Background: a young mother was murdered last year in my town (Ohio). The husband was arrested shortly after. Their 3 year old son was given to his closest relatives, the family of the husband.
The woman's sister lived in Turkey, and was originally from Isreal. She filed for a Visa to come to the funeral, but was denied. After 7 months, she was allowed a Visa to try and get custody of the nephew, as she feels he should not live with that side of the family. She said she would immigrate to the US, as she wouldn't want to force the child to relocate. The husband's family refuses to let her see the kid, and a legal battle is brewing.

Potential A-holism: A guy on my Facebook, someone whom I've known casually for about 7 years, often posts anti-immigrant, ""the media is the enemy"" things. He posts how the sister from Turkey has changed her FB status to ""living in (our town)"" and that this ""is how illegal immigrants sneak in, and how terrorists get their start.""

This post got to me, as someone who works at a newspaper covering the story, so I explained how she was here legally, and how she's seeking residency because she wants to take care of her nephew.
He called me a liar, accused me of falling for the media conspiracy (and told someone else to ""do what they can""to remain vigilant against liars), and said I was being racist for thinking he called her a terrorist ""just because she's Arabic."" At that point, he revealed he's the brother of the accused murderer, and the child is his nephew.

I apologized for not knowing, but still maintained that he can cry ""illegal immigrant"" all he wants, but ""terrorist"" went too far.

AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: This happened a year ago but now that I found this sub I'm curious to see what people think.

So last Christmas, my parents got me concert tickets. I was really excited about it. They got me two. I mentioned this to my friend, Ellie, just in a ""Oh my parents' got me this great gift!"" kind of way and she immediately started squealing, all excited that \*we\* were going to a concert. I didn't really correct her- the concert was not for another couple months, and it was very likely that I would invite her, but I hadn't then. Ellie comes from a LOT of money, and is pretty entitled with a lot of things. She once threw out a manual can opener because she wanted an electric one and ""manual can openers are for poor people"". Yes. Really. 

However, here's where I think I effed up. My parents got me two tickets. Ellie, assuming I would of course take her, asked if I could buy an additional 2 tickets so that her fiance and the guy I was talking to could come. I pushed back, said I didn't want to plan so far out, that I was just getting to know the guy I was talking to, that I didn't want to risk it. The tickets were expensive. After more back and forth, I did buy the tickets. Ellie was very much under the impression that I was taking her and I was definitely not correcting her, again because there was a good chance I would've taken Ellie and her fiance had everything stayed as it was. Also important to note, Ellie picked me up a bottle of wine at some point at my request. When I went to pay her for it, she declined and said something about how it was her concert ticket payment. I assumed she was joking, the bottle of wine was maybe $15 and her and her fiance's tickets combined were over $200. 

Anyways, like I said, I likely would have taken Ellie to the concert had things stayed the same. But they didn't. She started blowing off my texts and calls, and our plans in general. We made plans to go get lunch after classes one day, and she was going to pick me up from campus. It was raining. I waited for her for 20 minutes before she texted me and said she wasn't coming after all. Whenever I tried to talk to her about it, she would tell me she was busy and that I couldn't understand because my major was ""basically basket weaving"". If it matters, she is a nursing major and I am political science. My closest friend is an engineering major, and my other good friend is biology and pre-med, I totally understand when they don't have time for me, but I do expect the common courtesy of ""hey, I'm not going to be able to make it"" instead of just not showing up. 

Any time we did talk, she had something cruel to say about my other friends, the guys I liked, the clothes I wore. Hanging out with guys made me a whore, and the guy I liked wasn't good looking enough, and I was giving people the wrong idea by drinking at bars. That kind of stuff. I wound up blocking her and her fiance from viewing my social media because whenever they did, it opened the door for them to be critical. 

So with the concert coming up, I hadn't seen Ellie or had a pleasant nonconfrontational conversation with her in several months. The guy I liked had broken things off. So I went with three close guy friends of mine. Ellie \*\*freaked\*\* out. Her text to follow:

 ""You literally were such a weasel about this whole situation I didn't even want to have a conversation with you about it bc I would rip your head off and I've been so busy I haven't wanted to get worked up about it.  Do I need to just draw it out step by step? Bc obviously humanities has drained all your neurons.

A: you gave away the tickets without even asking which is a weasel move. If you wanted to just give them away bc we haven't been hanging out then you could have just told me before hand and had the consideration to alert me

B: even tho I only bought you 1 bottle of wine and have all the money in the world it was rude as shit for you not to offer to pay me back considering I bought it for you in exchange for a ticket and had gotten you another already 

C: the fact you made it look like you weren't going to the concert yourself and that you gave away all the tickets but actually you just sold the ones that me and (fiance) were going to use"" 

It got uglier after that, I eventually cut her and her fiance both out of my life. I've never felt I was in the wrong but I'm curious what other people think. To be totally clear, I paid for/was gifted all four tickets. The closest thing to payment Ellie gave me was a $15 bottle of wine. I didn't even know about the second one, if that matters, because I thought who the hell would think that is an equal tradeoff. And I have no idea why she was under the impression I wasn't going to the concert myself. I never said anything to that effect. I think probably because she figured out I'd taken her and her fiance off my social media, but that happened weeks prior. 

\*\*TL;DR:\*\* Made loose promises to take friend and her fiance to a concert, she started to act like kind of a crappy friend so I took other people, she FREAKED out. AITA?

So like i know that we arent really together or whatever (her words or not really because any discussion about where we are just ends with her telling me she doesnt want to talk about it), but it hurt me to see that regardless. 

Ive been trying to not be jealous or make comments and also trying not to go crazy when i dont see her all week, but i cant help but be hurt.

My friends suggested that i should do the same and try and move on. The thing is, I still want to try and make it work and i hate just casually dating its pointless as far as im concerned, but it does help me nkt be crazy and jealous in regards to her. So i went on a site and made a profile but i cant help but feel slimey and shitty. 

I really dont know of its good advice or if i should just give up because i feel like after a little over a year its worth fighting for still but i dont want to be the only one fighting even though shes the one who came and got me back... 
So AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm a junior in college, my sister is a senior in high school.

&amp;#x200B;

I got home from school for winter break on Sunday. My sister was out when I got home, so I didn't see her, and I ended up going to bed before she got back. Monday, she left for school before I woke up, so I didn't see her then either, nor did I see her that evening because she was working (note that I have not left my house since I got here). During this time, I didn't hear from her at all - the last meaningful communication I had with her was a couple weeks ago, when she texted asking if my boyfriend would buy weed for her friend group. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this afternoon. I am at home alone (entire family is at work/school) when I hear someone *pounding* on the window of our front door. It's my sister and her boyfriend, who just pulled up after leaving school early. This is the first time I have seen her since I got home. I let them in and say, ""Dude, where's your house key? You freaked me out."" My sister responds aggressively, ""I *left* it in my *room.*"" I try to make some half-assed joke about her driving around with out a house key on her key ring, which prompts her to yell ""*SUCK MY FUCKING DICK, OKAY?*"" immediately before going upstairs to her room.

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say, I have been in a bit of a shit mood since then, as it really hurt my feelings that my little sister does not apparently care at all about seeing me for the first time in months. She asked me why I seemed so ""grumpy"" as I was cleaning up the kitchen after dinner, and I explained to her that I was mad that she has either been ignoring me or actively being mean to me. She responded by going off on me for not being understanding of her busy schedule, saying that I could not have possibly expected her to say hi to me last night when she got home from work because she needed to go to bed (she got home at 9:30 PM and, while I do not know exactly what happened, I really doubt that she went straight to bed). I rolled my eyes at that, but said okay, and she once again immediately stormed off to her room after yelling, ""You can roll your eyes all you want but you're still a dick!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

So AITA for calling her out and saying that she upset me? Or for my reaction to her excuse? Or for not saying hi to her when I first opened the door? She's clearly pissed at me but I really feel like she has zero reason to be mad, especially when it seems to me that she was the dick in the first place. Enlighten me, please!

Now complete the following example-
input: A little of a backstory. I'm 31 non-native english speaker, have a 8 yo daughter, who lives with her mother. I have helped raise her, tho, been at her house, and all that, so I've been a part in her education/manners. Also, she spends every saturday with me.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago, a friend of mine from school got in touch with me via Facebook (we were classmates and good friends in school, but after graduation we went our separate ways). She tells me she moved back to town, she's got a kid (6 yo), got married, got divorced (husband cheated on her) and stuff. Since we've got kids who are around the same age, maybe we could meet up and the kids could play while we catch up. Sounds OK to me and my kid agrees, so we do.

&amp;#x200B;

They came to our house and they get along, playing until it's time to eat (tea time). So we are eating, and suddenly this kid farts. I look at him, and so does his mom, but we don't say anything. The kid then rips another one. My daughter looks at me kinda shocked, and the kid starts laughing and lets another one out. I look at my friend and she just looks me back and says ""kids will be kids"". So I look at the kid and say ""you shouldn't fart on the table, kid"" in my friendly-yet-firm dad voice.

&amp;#x200B;

He doesn't respond and starts eating his sandwich. He eats with his mouth open, talks while eating, and I can notice my daughter is annoyed. Suddenly, the kid farts again and starts laughing (again, mouth full with his sandwich bite.)

&amp;#x200B;

I got annoyed. He's 6, but he should at least apologize. So I tell him ""Hey, \[blank\], you shouldn't eat with your mouth open. And if you're gonna fart, at least apologize. I know farts can sound funny but we are eating. It's not polite."" His mom tells him to listen to me, and he kinda does (he still eats with his mouth half open, but no more farts.)

&amp;#x200B;

We finish eating and the kids go back to play, only my daughter now doesn't want to play with him. She asks if she can play with my phone, and the kid wants to play smash bros (wii U) so I put him against the CPU. Eventually, they have to leave. They live close so we walk. We let them at their house and everything seems normal, except is mom was silent the whole walk.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got tome, I text her saying my daughter and I got home safely. She texts me back a ""that's nice"" and then proceeds to tell me she liked the visit but was kinda annoyed of me lecturing her kid. That she get's it not the best behaviour but I should have overlooked it, and that the kid said he would like to come by again to play but didn't like me ""acting like a dad"". I tell her that I get her point, but in my house, and in my table, we behave, and that at no moment was I rude or harsh to her kid, I was acting mainly because my daughter showed concern. She responds that's ok, but to remember that ""kids are kids"". My daughter said she liked playing with him but ""didn't like him while eating"" (her words)

&amp;#x200B;

So, AITA here?

input: This happened a few hours ago and I'm still confused. TL;DR at the end.  


So my mate posts a picture to a group chat of him using a filter to look like some K-Pop star or something. Neither of us like K-Pop (I moderate an Anti K-Pop sub because I really hate it.) and we do stuff like that all the time to take the piss. Someone in the chat really likes K-Pop. I didn't think about that before replying ""Literally Disgusting"". Oh boy did I make a mistake. It really kicked off in the group chat with this person's friend having a go at me for ""making fun of something x is really passionate about."" I get told repeatedly to back off, but I didn't. Now I wasn't being stubborn just to be a jerk. Person x is the kind of person who will make fun of people 24/7 but can't take it themself. I'd had enough of them not having anything in the way of kickback for their shitty attitude and decided that if they were going to swing at me, I'd swing back. So anyway, after an hour or so of arguing and half a dozen people who weren't in the group chat messaging me about how person x was ""really pissed off"" it eventually dies down. Now I'm getting the cold shoulder from everyone in the chat bar my mate who just thinks its hilarious. I'm pissed off that person x is seen as a saint even though they just take the piss 24/7 without any kickback whatsoever, but when I decide to have a go at them I'm suddenly a terrible person. Oh and also I'm getting the whole snapchat story of ""why do I bother"". Does this make me the asshole?

TL;DR: I didn't back down from an argument because the other person can't take someone taking the piss out of them but does it to everyone else.

input: An acquaintance of mine recently got married and had a college mascot at his wedding. This isn't some small college either. This is a college that any football fan, even casual ones, would be familiar with. Everyone at the wedding thought it was cool, but I think it makes you seem like a douche. Even people who weren't at the wedding think it's neat that the mascot was there. From what I've gathered, the person who got married is friends with the person who is the mascot, and they asked them to do it. To me, it seems like a move to show that they are better than everyone else. Like shouting ""Oh, you can't have a college mascot at your wedding? You must be poor."" The kids parents are really good people, but the kid is definitely the type to show his ""status"" as ""wealthy."" Hint: they aren't wealthy, their parents are. I hope this is enough info to be judged.

Now complete the following example-
input: To preface: I'm a guy, 17. My friend, X, is 18.   


So I've been friends with this X for about three years, but we don't see very much of each other because she dropped out of high-school at the beginning of the year, about six months after she enrolled at my school. We've hung out a couple times, and once she brought one of her friends with. I was fine with this, and we all went to the theme park together. Now, X doesn't live at home anymore - teenage grievances with her mother, who I'm on good terms with. Her mother, takes buys these tickets for us, partly because she just wants to see her daughter more often, and because she wants to make sure she's got some friends like me - the kind my grandmother would call ""the good sort.""  


So the theme park was fun and all, but her X's friend is kind of upset that I'm there, and she thinks I'm a bit of a downer since I didn't want to smoke. She kind of put a dampener on the night to be honest. All in all, however, it was fun and I talked to X about how she was going and all that, gave her some advice and went home, but I didn't really like her friend.  


We decided to hang out tonight at Timezone, and we've got plans to get some food and just walk the city - it's Schoolies time here on the Gold Coast, with all the year 12 kids who've finished school drinking and partying, among other things.  


She texts me, about half an hour ago, and asks if she could bring ""J"".  
So I explain to her that when she brings her friends I kinda feel like a third wheel, you know? She says she understands and it's okay, because he's just gonna play some games.  


I tell her I'm not sure, and ask who he is.  


""Ahaha my boyfriend."" ^(oh boy)  


Now, I know what some of you are thinking - I admit that I \*do\* like her, but I don't really think she's the right girl for me. ^(That's all I've got to say about that.)  


I tell her that I think I'm gonna give it a miss, but she says that he won't come then.  
I tell her not to let me stop you, and to have fun.  


I think that she's now under the impression that I want to be more serious with her, you know? I just think that it would be like before if she was bringing a friend, and it would be even worse if it was her boyfriend.

input: I’m currently a graduate student in an engineering program in America. I share an office with another grad student whose from a different country. She recently received a message on LinkedIn from a recruiter for a rather large computer/tech company advertising a few openings in there manufacture sector for chemical engineers. Due to being from another country and English as her third language, she had me help her draft all her emails to this recruiter and fill out the prescreening questionnaire and actual application. After she submitted all this info she showed me the job listing because she was worried she didn’t meet one of the qualifications.

Here’s where the WIBTA comes in. I scribbled down the listing number and looked it up later. Not only do I meet all the requirements, most of them I meet to a T. It’s basically my dream job, they’re literally hiring people to work on the process I’m writing my thesis on. Would I be the asshole if I applied for this job? 

I’m almost sure I’d get it over her. I’m defending 5 months before she is, and it’s a time priority hire. My skill set is also more aligned, she doesn’t meet one of the 5 listed qualifications, a programming background. She’s also international and has not begun applying for any form of permanent work visa or anything, where as being a citizen I can work with no restrictions. The real kicker is, the one thing she didn’t take my advice on is the expected salary range. She wrote 95k with a 10% bonus and relocation costs, for a job that pays on average 72k with 6% bonus. If I apply I’d use a much more reasonable salary range, most likely boosting my chances.

So WIBTA if I apply for the same job as my lab mate, a job I only found out about by helping her fill out her application?

&amp;#x200B;

I(f26) used to have a friend(f24) for years, I had previously felt somewhat uncomfortable.

I remember living with a boy who was my boyfriend for a short time, I invited her to the house and when I finished with him I realized that they became friends, I didnt give importance to that.

A couple of months ago I divorced my husband(m31) and I realized that the same thing happened, even though she knew the reason why I divorced him (he was unfaithful,cheat on me, and he was very manipulative) I warned her that to be careful since he was going to try to contact or add people that known  me to continue stalking

Recently (my fault for snooping) I saw that they became friends by instagram and she liked all her post.

I got upset and bothered, I wrote to her asking her what was going on and she told me that nothing, that I only have to worry about my life, I felt something betrayed because I thought she was my friend.

then she sent me screenshot where she talks with him (so i could see that nothing was happening) and in a part of the conversation she says ""you seem to be a very good boy, you dont seem to be what she tells me about you ..."" She also send her voice messages

Then, today, in the morning, I wrote to her and told her to dont talk to me anymore, and I blocked her.

input: My family has had a system for as long as I can remember that works as follows: 

On a communal device, one can limit the current user's turn to 30 more minutes by giving a warning.

My brother is now refusing to follow this system, going so far as to lie and state that the communal device is his personal PC.

I do have a personal PC, but the crux of the argument is that this communal PC is the only one with a VR system hooked up and the only one that could have one hooked up to it due to space constraints. 

Admittedly I'm not totally blameless: his argument is that he's playing with a friend who has a 2 hour limited timespan, however I gave the warning coincidentally 30 minutes before they got on. Rather than give me my 30 minutes immediately and then explaining the situation, he chose to play solo for that 30 minutes and THEN complain when I returned to claim my turn. He then proceeded to argue for a full hour claiming that he had an inherent right to use my *personal* PC to play his game. During this tine, I could have gotten my half hour and then he'd have the entire remaining timespan to play with his friend. Despite this, he has refused to admit his own lack of foresight so I'm settling this once and for all: AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: This is probably going to be a long one.

I'm a commercial cleaner, I absolutely love my job, it was perfect up until last Thursday. I work on a team with my best friend (Jay), and my boyfriend (Dee), how could it get any better right? Jay has been a close friend for about 6 years and I have been seriously dating Dee for 9 months now.

We drive to 6 accounts on Thursdays, since my car has been down a little over a month now, Dee has been picking us (Jay and I) up from our house. Obviously Jay and I live together and Dee lives about 20mins away from us. 

Here is where it gets interesting, my boyfriend has a decent car, the outside could use some TLC but the interior is immaculate. Dee is a genius when it comes to wiring, so as well as having an awesome sound system he also has the video display up front and we can watch movies on the way to our accounts. 

Jay has been struggling a bit with his alcoholism, he doesn't always drink on the job but occasionally he does, I dont judge as long as you get your work done, keep the liquor out of the accounts, and of course dont break anything. He has worked the better part of the last 6 months with no issues so I had no issue. 

This day though I could see signs that he had a little too much, and I told him, you're cut off from this point. He wasn't happy but obliged, or so I thought. 

Jay asked my boyfriend for his car keys so he could fetch a cleaner we forgot to grab from the car, goes outside and is unseen for 10 minutes, I go out and he is still in the car looking for the cleaner... it was on the floor where we told him it was. In the same back seat he was just sitting in, but for some reason he is sitting in the front driver seat. 

Fast forward to us finishing up the account and leaving, I am the last out because I have alarms to set. I get in the car and see my boyfriend pick up a cigarette that had been set on the dashboard after probably 2 hits and burned down to the filter... We both look at the dash to see a nasty melted gouge. Dee asked Jay if he was smoking in the front seat of the car... No was the response he got. We both look at the cigarette and sure enough Marlboro on the filter, (Dee smokes Newports and I dont smoke at all) Jay smokes marlboros. He asked again, this isn't your MARLBORO cigarette that burned up on my dash? Again no. 
At this point Dee is so angry he asks Jay to get out the car and ride with another team member to our last account. Jay exits and we sit for a second to take in the situation. 

Dee is furious, I get it, he is trying to sell his car, the interior had no damage up until this point. I try talking him down and eventually he does, although he does not want my friend back in his vehicle without an apology or the cash to replace the dash. Not so unreasonable, well Jay decides he is going to avoid Dee, I get it, Dee is pissed. 

Fast forward again, time to go, I was under the impression my other team member would take Jay home, he had messaged me on fb and said he would either ask or uber home. Come to find out he walked an hour and a half home despite the options he had. To add to this he posted on snapchat about how he has to walk home because people are ""childish"" and ""petty"". I am pissed when I find this out, because I find out later from my boss and another coworker. 

When Dee and I leave I saw Jay had left his food in the car...or rather in my boyfriend's daughter's car seat directly, and the plate on the floor, I try to hastily clean it up but no, Dee saw it and he came to the back seat to look for more, and starts pulling empty marlboro packs, Naked juice bottles, wadded up paper towel used to clean up some kind of red spill and more garbage from under the seat. These are obvi from my best friend because as I have said before neither of us smoke Marlboros and I know my boyfriend doesn't drink Naked. At this point there is nothing I can do to make Dee reconsider Jay riding with him.

Now I have Jay telling me over Facebook messages that he will make his own way to work. 

Ok then.

On Friday we started a brand new account, so both of my bosses as well as the regional leader is with us. I get to work with Dee and my boss asks where Jay is, I told her what he told me, he was making his own way, then I hear about the snapchat posts, personally I dont use snap but when I was shown the snaps I wanted to snap. My boss calls him and he states we just left him. Now I'm really pissed. My boss leaves to go get him and I tuck my anger down for a later conversation with my best friend. 

Unfortunately we had no time to hash things out right away so I figured at the next account we would sit down and talk. No dice, he asks my boss to take him BACK home, completely behind my back, to the point that I didnt know he was leaving until I got to the next account. I message him asking why he would do this, he tells me he's not getting in between me and my boyfriend, I told him this is not the case, there is nothing I can do for him concerning Dee and his car and how he should've come to him as a man and apologize. Jay goes on about how important Dee is to me and how this isn't my problem and he will do what he has to do from this point. I said yeah Dee is important to me, but so are you so man tf up and talk to this man before he decides he doesn't want an apology anymore.

The whole weekend goes by and Jay says nothing to me, we live in the same house yet had no interaction, so when today rolls around I do what I always do, get my things together and wait for Dee to call me and say he is here. When I leave I see Jay's room has no light and did not see him elsewhere in the house so I assumed he was already gone and leave. Minutes after leaving, I get a text saying how he wanted to apologize and how could we just leave him behind...

This is where I snapped, I told him straight up that I didnt even know he was in the house and if he really wanted to apologize to Dee he would've either asked me for his contact info over the weekend or been on point watching for him to pull into the driveway. Personally if it were me and my job on the line I wouldn't have bothered with shoes I would've gotten out there to speak my peace. He gets sassy with me about his walk home, and I told him he walked home because he wanted to, he could've just as easily apologized or asked the other team member (she was actually pissed he didn't ask her). I told him straight up that his priorities were screwed up and he needs to grow up and take responsibility for his choices, and that people aren't going to wait around to hold his hand through things. 

Then I started in on his snapchat posts I was getting hounded about by our office gossips who were trying to get all the juicy details of the story...

I asked him if Dee was petty for bringing him to work everyday without asking for gas money or even getting a thank you in return, yes he comes for me because I'm his girlfriend but in all reality he doesn't have to bring my friend too. Was my boyfriend petty every time he made pit stops so you could get your cigarettes or liquor, or take you to the store? I got no answers to this question, so I told him I wasn't going to be a member of his pity party. He states he didn't want a pity party, and I told him obvi you want pity cause you asked for it all over snapchat where our co workers can see and continue to message me about. 

I'm not sorry for telling him to grow up and be a man (hes 32) but I do wonder if I am an asshole in this.

input: My girlfriend and i were getting ready to go to the grocery store and our 16 month old daughter is playing with her baby alive. We kept trying to get shoes on her feet but she'd wiggle away to go back to her toy. Eventually i get tired of the back and forth so i take the toy and tell her she can have it back when we get back home. My daughter doesnt know very many words but she loves to back talk and give attitude, so shes fussing at ne for taking her toy and i say ""i dont care, you can have it back when we get home"". I thought i was being perfectly normal until my girlfriend starts getting mad at ne telling me not to say ""i dont care"" to our daughter. This completely blew my mind as ive been saying it and ive never gotten this kind of reaction. I ask why I cant say ""i dont care"" and her response is ""look it up"". I personally am not a fan of ""going with the flow"" especially when it comes to parenting, it just feels to me like one of those things where you just gotta do it how you do it because thats the beauty of it. 
I honestly feel like i didnt do anything wrong and shes just overreacting, but im here to ask. 

Am i the asshole here?

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm M18 and moved in with my dad and stepmom back in November. This is going to need a bit of background though I think before I start.

My dad has always been a drug user, from very heavy stuff back in the day to now only weed and alcohol. He's aggressive and abusive but also caring. Very narcissistic and outright stupid sometimes, but also smart and logical other times. He's very unpredictable but he's always been kind to me. My mom's side of the family, who I've spent most of my life with, all dislike him greatly. I've always defended him as much as I can, but I definitely understand and agree with them, to a degree.

Like I said above, my dad is unpredictable. An accurate metaphor would be a sparkplug. Since November, he's gotten progressively worse and worse, consistently yelling at my stepmom and myself for the dumbest things, like not putting enough creamer in his coffee or no mustard on a sandwich. This is seriously the things he gets so mad about, he has to leave for several hours and come back that night and ""apologize"". My stepmom and I discuss him frequently when he's gone and we have no idea what to do. He doesn't have a job, except from Uber-ing occasionally, and my stepmom works 40+ hour weeks at a restaurant to support us. I help out as much as I can with my financial aid, mostly by paying certain bills or just taking care of myself and taking that burden off of them.

My dad is still kind to me, but it feels a bit backhanded. He bought me an expensive game (AC Odyssey Gold Edition) for Christmas, which is awesome, and he buys the food I like and treats me with respect, but he also kicked in my door because I was struggling with my counselors to get a schedule at college. He fixed it afterwards and apologized, and we talked about it all. The next morning though, he barges in my room at 7 in the morning and yells at me for the exact same thing, despite having an understanding the previous day!

Recently I've just stayed in my room and kept it locked. I go out and get food when he leaves, and I talk very minimally to him. I feel like I can't do anything in this house without getting yelled at or even potentially hit. I always hear him yelling through the walls. He gets mad I don't talk to him and spend time with him, but what am I supposed to do? As a result I barely eat and sleep and live in constant anxiety about what he's gonna do next.

Am I the asshole Reddit? I don't know at this point. I feel justified in not giving him the satisfaction of being a dick and still getting what he wants (time with me). But I also feel really awful because he does a lot for me and doesn't ask much in return (unless he's being a massive prick). So please, let me know.

I had to reformat this post, so some details might be missing. I don't really have any other place to go, or if I do move, I wouldn't have the privacy and freedoms I do here (like having to sleep on a couch).

Now complete the following example-
input: So basically I have an old truck I have been wanting to sell for a while because it’s diesel and I can’t deal with all the problems as a teenager right now. My parents told me they would be fine with me selling it and buying a new truck as long as I understand they still own it. So I put it up for sale and a guy wants to trade me this really nice truck in great condition because he wants a diesel, and our appraisals are almost the same and I love the look of his truck and it’s gas and I’m very good condition. 

We chatted for a while and I sent him all the stuff about my truck and he sent me all his stuff and we agreed on trading this weekend. I told my parents about it and my dad keeps blowing it off and saying he is having second thoughts and wants to research some stuff before selling the truck.

Now, this is what my dad ALWAYS does when he’s not interested in me doing something. He just keeps trying to blow it off until hopefully I forget about it. So now I am set up to trade trucks with this guy and he is keeping it from other sales for me and my dad is telling me no now after he clearly told me yes earlier.

So this is my question: am I an asshole if I cancel this deal after I told the guy I would this weekend and he cancelled other offers with people? Or is my dad being the asshole for not letting me sell it after saying I could at any time?

input: When she followed it in the past she went through my followers (don’t know why) and found a girl I admittedly used to flirt with. I did unfollow her but didn’t appreciate the drama of my girlfriend.

Fast forward to the last week, she (my girlfriend) asked my if she could follow my instagram again and I refused, telling her I don’t want the drama because she’ll go through my followers or something like that again and nitpick. 

We fell out over this and spoke again tonight and she said she feels as if I’m hiding something, but I’m not, I really just don’t want her looking at who I follow. She can’t understand this and says it’s a deal breaker for her. 

I feel as if she prioritises her friends online over me and she brought this up saying I don’t prioritise her or her feelings if she isn’t allowed to follow any of my social media and call her a drama queen for being upset that she isn’t allowed to. I said that’s untrue. It’s not a big deal at all. She said she understands that it’s ‘just social media’ but the fact that I outright refuse to let her follow me is strange. I disagree.

input:    So my friend was getting her hair done from a hairstylist, (she does her business at her house) Since she didn't want to be alone she asked me to come over. Me and my sister came and went inside. About 3 minutes later she starts asking me if I was from Africa. I was like...""yeah why?"" 

Then she starts a lecture about how I was suppose to greet her since it's a common courtesy in Africa. At this point it gets very awkward...because she looked angry and thought I was rude for not greeting her when I came in. Which I would admit...I was in the wrong, but the fact that she had to point it out made everything really uncomfortable for me, and she kept looking at me from before and I didn't know why..i guess it was because she was waiting for me to say ""hello"" or something and so when I didn't...she felt like she had to point it out. 

Normally in my culture, if I was the one at home, I was suppose to greet the guest that CAME to my house. I don't know why she couldn't just greet me and welcomed me to her house instead...

Now complete the following example-
input: Another post has me wondering. Lately the only way my kid will stay quiet and still for diaper changes is if I let him hold my phone playing kids’ music and sing along. This is fine at home, and if I’m sick to death of Victor Vito and Freddie Vasco eating their burritos up and down the west coast, I can change him on the floor and deal with squirmy worm for a few minutes. In public, he’s tried to climb off changing tables multiple times in the last week, and when he isn’t trying to crawl off the edge he’s trying to pull to stand or he’s screaming his head off because diaper changes are the worst thing that’s ever happened to him.

FWIW, I’m not a bad singer so long as I stay in my chest voice - a bad asthma flare left me with chronic cough, some airway scarring, and a really gnarly transition to head voice. The music he likes is all well within my range, and we rarely make it through more than two two minute songs. I know he can throw my phone, I have a heavy duty case and I’m pretty confident it can take it. If I don’t sing along and dance and make silly faces, or if I just sing alone without letting him hold the phone or without playing music, we’re right back to attempting suicide by four foot headfirst plunge onto tile.

Now complete the following example-
input: Where I live, one is legally permitted to bike on the sidewalk as long as you yield to pedestrians. Whilst biking, I use bike or car lanes most of the time, but if I have to make a left turn using a crosswalk and I end up on the wrong side of the road, I'll usually stay on the sidewalk until I hit another crosswalk and I can get on the right side again.

This was the case today, and the sidewalk I was going down was relatively narrow (I would say double-file, give or take). I saw a dude walking towards me with his kid and his dog, so I moved as far right as I could and slowed down (there was enough room for us to pass each other). He continued to walk straight down the middle of the sidewalk, and when he got close enough that I stopped completely, he pointed at the bike lane next to us (going down the wrong side of the road) and said in a condescending tone ""You know, they have the bike lanes for a reason"" or something to that effect. I didn't really know what to do with this so I just said ""OK"" and started pedaling again. He then proceeded past me and kicked my back wheel decently hard.

I'm relatively sure he wasn't justified, but was there anything I could or should have done differently in the situation?

Now complete the following example-
input: So pretty much the title.
I (21M) am in college, and my friend is a 19M. For context, he lacks social awareness often can be irritating at times, but I know he means well.
Basically, he has crippling anxiety all the time and constantly needs validation for every choice he makes. I’m talking topics where no one else could possibly know better than himself, and yet he never trusts his own instinct. 
I’ve tried helping him by simply giving someone to talk to, however this is mentally exhausting. He’ll essentially say something bad about himself(often true), and want the other person to give him reassurance that it is not true.
 I’ve tried giving him validation to ease his nerves, but I honestly now feel like I am feeding a bad cycle by doing this.
As of now I simply avoid talking to him in most cases, as I feel like he needs to learn how to trust his own instincts for himself, and to stop needing validation from others.

What do you guys think? Should I be there for him and give him someone to talk to, avoid him and let him figure things out for himself, or do you think another option would be best?

Now complete the following example-
input: Hi folks.  A small confession, this isn't really worrying me or anything, but when I found out about this sub a couple of days ago I LOVED the idea.  (Am I the asshole for not posting a serious situation?  Lol.)    So anyway, I finally came up with a situation which I could share.  Happened about a year ago.

I live in Spain now and my first year here I met a young Spanish guy about my age in a club that we both attended.  I was visiting from another town.  We became quick friends and used to have deep life discussions and stuff.  Before each of us had girlfriends, we would hang out every 3-4 months.  I would always hop on a bus or whatever and go meet him where he lives (Seville), he would put me up in his house and I would pay for our meals.  

Well, once we got girlfriends, things started to peter out, but we maintained contact more or less.  One day, we had planned to meet up, and I made my usual travel arrangements.  At the last minute he bails on me because he ""isn't in a good space mentally"" (to my knowledge he has no diagnosed mental health issues, he was just feeling down or whatever).  I tried convincing him but hey, whatever, he doesn't feel well.  Fine.  I cancelled all my travel arrangements and didn't think too much about it.

About 6 months later we tried again.  When we agreed upon my visit I asked him, are you SURE this is what you want?  Because last time you bailed.  He said yes.  I confirmed with him, AGAIN, 1 week before my visit - again making SURE he wanted me to visit.  He says yes.  And finally, a couple days later, he calls and I already know what it's about.  He says, can I please NOT come because it turns out this is the only weekend he can be at his flat alone with his girlfriend.  I made a big deal about it this time, like, dude, you've done this TWICE now and I confirmed with you two times before making my arrangements.  You're gonna make me do this again?  And, he did.  I had to cancel all my arrangements, losing time, energy, and a bit of money.

After that moment I pretty much decided, hey, this guy has no respect for what's going on with me and is too wrapped up in his own crap to be a good friend for me.  So I was sad at ""losing him"" but I stopped talking to him.  Just didn't feel like he had anything to add to my life.  

It's not like we were super close, and this is totally platonic BTW, but we definitely had a strong friendship.  Not my BFF but probably (one of my) BFF(s) in this new country.

For whatever reason I finally called him today, told him that what he did wasn't OK with me, but that I didn't want to argue and just hoped he was well and all.  And that we should stay in touch.

So, AITA / WITA for pretty much cutting him out of my life for a whole year over this?

Note: He also did not try to re-establish contact with me in this period.

Now complete the following example-
input: TL;DR at the end.

So it's Friday night. SO and I are playing video games when he gets a call at 9:30pm from a work friend who lives one street over, asking if we want to go over to his house to drink and hang out with some other friends.

I'm really not in the mood to go over there. I take medication every night for nausea and it doubles as a sleeping pill. I'd already taken this medication, plus I'm in my pajamas, about ready for bed. I told him he should go without me and that i was going to bed instead.

As he's leaving, I tell him not to do anything with any girls. He has never done anything with another woman as long as he's been with me, so I have no reason to think that he would tonight. I was mostly joking, but I'm also feeling a little self conscious. I'm in my second trimester of pregnancy, so I've started to get a little bit of a bump, plus I'm not pooping regularly and I'm extra gassy today. I just feel really unattractive and my anxiety brain was telling me he might think this as well. He obviously didnt find my comment funny, however.

Cut to about 10 minutes after he left. I'm in bed, getting settled in, and I hear glass breaking. I automatically imagine someone watching my SO leave and, thinking the house is empty, break in through a window. I jump up to lock the bedroom door and immediately call my SO, asking if he was in the house because I heard glass shatter. He didnt even seem phased by this, from what I could tell. He tells me he'll walk back and for me to get his gun by our bed. 

While I'm waiting for him to get back, I start to realize a couple things. 1.) We have a dog who barks if he hears anything strange at night. He w as s suspiciously quiet. 2.) The shattering noise definitely wasnt loud enough to be something big, like a window breaking. I started to feel pretty stupid right as my husband walks into the apartment.

He clears the house and doesn't see anyone, so I go to check the living room. Yup. Our dog licked a bowl off the coffee table and it shattered. He *never* does this, but the table was pulled a little closer to the couch tonight, so I guess he took his chance.

As we're cleaning up the mess, my SO says ""there aren't even any girls there!"" I was sincerely confused by this, so he explains that the only women at the party are there with their husbands. The way he says all this to me, I can tell that he thinks I broke the bowl so that he would have to come home. I told him, ""I didnt do this so you would have to come back!"" But he just muttered something that didnt make sense and then left for the party again. Didnt seem like he was in a great mood.

I do feel pretty stupid about not checking the house to actually see if someone was breaking in, but was I really being that big of an asshole to put him in a bad mood like this?

TL;DR: SO went to a party while I stayed home and I told him not to do anything with any women there, even though i have no reason to say this. After he leaves, I think I hear someone breaking into the apartment, so I call him home to check. After finding out it was just our dog, he thinks I tricked him into coming home and leaves again in a bad mood.

Yesterday he (Tom) met his GF and a friend of her (lets call her Bettie) in a local Burger King. Everything startet off pretty chill they talked a bit and everything was fine. Bettie weighs about 110kg ( 242 lbs)  and is about 170 cm (5' 7). Bettie ate a muffind and the GF ate something else and they asked Tom if he wants to eat something too. He said the doesnt feel like eating now because he feels fat (he isnt overweight). After he said that, Betties mood changed a lot and she was pretty offended and after she was offended his GF was also not so happy. They didnt talk that much afterwards and half an hour later everybody went home.  
Tom went home with his GF and they had a fight about what he said and she thinks he is an Asshole, he and i think he is not.

input: So this is all so stupid, but it started an argument and I can’t tell if I’m being unreasonable.  

At noon my boyfriend and I were hungry.  I was craving Taco Bell and he wanted 5 guys.  I offered to go pick them up.  I got our meals and came back.  I handed him his receipt.  He didn’t really get it so I asked him to pay me back.  


He asked me if I was serious.  He then went on about how he pays for all our dates and nights out and has never asked for a dime.  Which is true, but to me that’s different.  Those are times that he is taking me out.  Furthermore if he had ever asked me to split the bill I would have gladly, he just always picks up the check.   That’s his choice.  

Another thing is that he makes a lot more money than I do.  $20 for him is a lot different than $20 for me.  He ended up giving me the money, but now he’s being moody and not talking to me besides one word answers.

Now complete the following example-
input: The dog is not a therapy dog, just a friendly lab. According to my 4yo niece, the dog is at the preschool everyday. 

And don't get me wrong, I love dogs...I just love kids more. 

My 3yo nephews had a pretty severe athsma attack shortly after I picked him up from preschool last week following a coughing episode at the daycare. This is a typical allergic reaction for him and he's been hospitalized in the past.

My sister reminded the preschool owner that her son is allergic to dogs and the preschool/dog owner told my sister that she keeps the dog away from my nephew. She then changed the suject and called my sister out for my forgetting to sign the kids out when I picked them up.

Keeping the pet allergens away from my nephew when the dog is there all the time just doesn't seem possible. Not to mention the little guy LOVES dogs and will do anything to get close to one.

The athsma attack scared me to death and I don't think the owner is looking out for the health and safety of my nephew. WIBTA for calling in an anonymous tip about the dog? Are there any other options? 

Finding another daycare/preschool for my sisters three kids is not an option at this time. My sister is afraid that if we call the health department then the owner will find a way to kick her out and she will lose her job.

Now complete the following example-
input: Okay, so a little backstory. I suffer from anxiety and depression, and over the last year or so it's gotten considerably worse. About three months ago everything became too much and I took an overdose. One of my roommates found me and I was really out of it but still conscious - I had thrown up quite a bit. They called an ambulance, and we waited. 

I don't remember much but I recently found out that they rang some people for advice &amp; they were told i was being inconsiderate as one of them had an assignment due tomorrow and they were still working on it. She told me that while waiting for the ambulance I was complaining about being in pain while she tried to work on the project &amp; it bothered her. 

What really bothers me is that when the ambulance came, neither of my roommates came to the hospital with me so I was left alone on a hospital gurney for hours with no one. 

At the time I didn't think about it much, but i'm feeling really low again at the moment and my anxiety keeps bringing my mind back to this and I just kinda feel like shit about it all. I know i shouldn't expect them to drop everything for me &amp; it's not about that. I just feel really hurt and like i was (and am) nothing but an inconvenience. This isn't a pity party attempt - i want an honest opinion to try and figure out of I have a right to be upset or if it's my anxiety/depression making me feel like this. thanks.

Now complete the following example-
input: My family has always had 2 or 3 dogs at a time. I love dogs, and they usually like me back. If they don't, or if they seem to be only tolerating me, I leave them alone. But all of my dogs have either warmed up to me or been friendly from the start. I feel like I have only met one truly mean dog, and it wasn't her fault; she had been trained to be a ""fighting"" dog, and even she settled in and became friendly. But our new dog is something else.

I'm not even paying rent, so I don't think I get a vote as to whether or not we have new pets, but I did ask to wait for a while. Two out of our three dogs died of old age last year. It hit me hard, and I miss them like mad. My father brought home a 1-year-old yellow lab about 1-2 weeks ago.

This dog hates me and only me. For the first week, I gave him the benefit of the doubt, because he's moved to a new home and is certainly scared. He's loosened up around my parents and our other dog. He's friendly and even cuddly at times - to everyone else. I have been nothing but gentle toward him, but he can't stand me. He snarls and growls at me when I move. He barks every time I - and only I - open a door or use the stairs. Most terrifying: he seeks me out, growling, then starts barking and advancing when he sees me.

I am shorter than my parents and significantly smaller. If I were attacked, I would not win the fight. He genuinely scares me. At first, I tried speaking in a friendly/calm voice while giving him space, the same way that my parents did. This has worked for them. It has not worked with me; when they aren't home, he ""guards"" the bottom of the staircase and threatens me when I appear. His old home didn't have any stairs, so I tried staying downstairs all night with him. When my parents are downstairs, he jumps up beside them and lies down. With me, he moves to the other room, then growls and barks whenever I make noise or move around.

Honestly, I think it would be okay if he only did these things when I was near him - because then I would just give him space. But he comes looking for me or goes to wherever I am and acts like I'm an intruder. I don't even know how he knows when a door is opened by me as opposed to anyone else, but he only growls when it's me. He especially freaks out any time I use the bathroom, and I have some medical issues that mean I'm in there every 2-4 hours. No one has been able to get a full night's sleep because of the barking. I feel like it has been long enough that he should at least understand that I live here too, because I haven't done anything differently from anyone else!

I don't want to be all ""It's me or the dog."" That's not a fair choice. But I'm constantly on edge. I can't stay if this dog stays. AITA?

input: This is an alt account, for reasons I'll describe in the post/story.

Backstory: I've used Reddit over 2 years now. I almost exclusively use mobile on Android, but I don't know all the facets to the app. I hadn't put serious thought into making an alt until today, as I never saw a need to. This meant my casual-browsing account was also my porn-viewing account, and I didn't have any consistent qualms with this.

Cut to me browsing the Home tab. I'm enjoying the front page when, to my dismay, an untagged NSFW image rolls through. It's explicit enough to make you uncomfortable, if you were to notice this on my screen in public. This isn't the first time I've had this happen, so I go to my typical response. I comment, asking why an NSFW post isn't tagged. Almost always, within an hour or two the post gets properly tagged. I have unfollowed one sub for consistently not tagging posts.

Today, I got a new response. My comment, asking for the post to be properly flagged, received a reply telling me: ""you're on a very NSFW sub. unfollow"". I replied pointing out that the sub asks users to tag their posts if they're NSFW, as well as adding my concerns about casual browsing. That reply received a similar response.

When I posed the situation to a friend, he suggested making an alt account and showed me how easy it is to switch between accounts on mobile. So here's the alt.

Now complete the following example-
input: 5 1/2 years ago I moved by myself across the country. My whole family is still back in my home state. I come from a big family, lots of cousins and we were all very close growing up. Since then things have changed. We all still love each other, but my visits home are short and few. 

Six months ago I got married at a courthouse. I love my husband very much and it was a quick engagement and I guess you could use the word ""eloped""

My mother was understandably shocked and a little upset when I first told her. We're very close and I usually tell her everything. 

She now wants this summer to throw us a wedding celebration with my whole family when we come visit. She wants a band and to have it catered, and my whole family there, the whole deal. I do not want that at all. My family has very traditional expensive weddings. While I respect that and have enjoyed every one that I've attended and been in, that is not my style at all. I'm not one of those ppl that wanted a big party, I just wanted to marry my husband because I love him. I dont need a party to prove that.

My mother really wants this and tbh, the whole thing would make me super uncomfortable. I dont know these extended family members any more and I'm sure they couldn't care less weather I'm married or not. Like I said, my visits are short and not often and I would prefer to spend my time with the people I love and not partying with people i dont know any more. I'd rather hang out with my parents and brother and grandparents.

My husband is indifferent, he said he'd be happy either way. 

This whole party is for my mom, and shes told me that. If she wants a party just throw a BBQ or something. I should also point out that I am her only daughter. My brother is planning on having a traditional wedding though, so it's not like she'll miss out on both her children's wedding. 

I'm in need of some outside perspective, reddit, AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm a freshman in college, and I've known my girlfriend and her family since we were little kids. We both come from super conservative families, so when we first started to like each other we knew that going out was a big no-no. 

We started texting about 3 years ago, and we've gotten to know each other pretty well. We only see each other in church and stuff like that a few days a week, and we would always talk about how we wanted to be together, only us two. But we knew we had to wait a while for that to happen.

Fast forward to September of this year, in her high school schedule she has basically an hour of free time where she can do whatever she wants for lunch. My school is 10 min away so naturally, we were very excited at the prospect of finally having a chance to go out without our parents knowing. We have fun, go to eat, walk in parks, all of the cliche relationship things that we've wanted to do for years. She's the perfect girl for me.

I don't go out with her every day, two times a week she goes out with a friend. Her friend is nice and funny, it doesn't bother me that they hang out. Sometimes, though, my girlfriend says that she can't go out on days that we've agreed we're going to meet because she's going to be with her friend. Also, earlier in the year we would also somtimes skip class to have more time with each other, but we stopped because she didn't want to miss any more classes and she felt bad about it, and I agree with that. However, she repeatedly skips school with her friend even after she told me she doesn't want to skip school anymore. I don't even find out about it unless I see it on social media, she doesn't tell me. 

I've tried talking to her about it, but she says it's not a big deal and not something worth getting mad or annoyed over. And sometimes I think she's right, our relationship is pretty perfect in spite of our circumstances, and maybe I'm the asshole for getting mad at this. But sometimes still, whenver she cancels or skips with her friend, it makes me feel unimportant.

TL;DR: Girlfriend and I finally go out after years of knowing each other, I get mad when she cancels on me or skips school with her friend instead of me.

Now complete the following example-
input: My mother-in-law moved in with us about three months ago. It's been ok. She and I are clashing personalities and cultures, and it's come up more often now that we share a similar space. She is a traditional Hispanic woman with a strong sense of decorum and family hierarchy. I am white, liberal in all ways, and agnostic about most traditions, including and especially the need to obey elders.

Before, out of consideration to my wife and out of a belief in the my ""my house, my rules adage,"" I used to watch what I said around her very carefully because we only visited with her about once a month. But when my spouse asked if she could live with us, I said I was okay with it as long as I no longer had to walk on eggshells around her. My spouse agreed and told their mother that she needs to respect that we do and say things differently in our home than she may like. I don't know how her mother responded to that but it never came up again.

Last week, my 10-year-old and I were chatting while having breakfast while she was in the kitchen. We were goofing around and making bodily function sounds to each other. We are very mature, I know. But when I said, ""I fart in your general direction!"" and made a loud raspberry sound at her (she was giggling like crazy), my mother-in-law slammed down her coffee mug and said, in Spanish, ""Don't you dare teach my granddaughter to be so disrespectful. I will not allow this kind of vulgarity in my home any longer."" And I said, in English (I can understand Spanish but can't speak it well), ""This is my home. You don't get a say in how I interact with my kids, or how any of us speak or act."" She stormed away and now isn't speaking to me.

My spouse says ITA because I embarrassed her in front of our daughter and because I expected her to accept too much, too quickly. They also say that I am being a little culturally insensitive and that I need to respect that abuela will be deeply offended by how I spoke to her, so I need to apologize. But I think it was important for her to see that I will stand up for our interactions/myself and also to stick to what we originally agreed on--that I won't be policed in my own home.

Now complete the following example-
input: A brief background - I have been working in my career since graduating college 5 years ago and have lived comfortably thanks to my hard work. My boyfriend went to college a little later in life and is currently working on getting jobs in his field. Though we live in the same city, being in different places in our lives at the moment has created some conflict, since we can’t necessarily always do the same things.

I have done as much as I can to include him in things that require spending money by offering to cover it (I wanted to have the experiences together), always been understanding when he can't be around because of working odd jobs on weekends to keep his finances stable, those types of things. 

A few of my friends and I decided to take a weekend trip soon to a city no one but I had ever visited. I jumped on this opportunity to be the guide of all our debauchery! I instantly knew I wanted to ask my boyfriend to join. He said he wouldn't be able to because of the cost. I offered to cover it and he accepted. There's been a ton of excitement and chatting surrounding this trip ever since. 

Fast forward to now. I wake up this morning to him telling me that a large group of his friends from college are going to a cabin in the woods near my hometown next weekend and they miss him and want him to go. It's very short notice and would require him to take off of work. 

I know he was super excited getting that text and also rushing to get out the door to work, but as I sit here thinking there are a few things that are bothering me and 2 things that definitely have me hurt. I'm bothered by the fact that he didn't in the moment think to ask me about going or even hint at gauging my interest. I'm also bothered that he would so quickly be okay with not working for a weekend and risk his financial stability - I only say this because he has been very open and talks about his predicament quite a bit. 

What I'm hurt by is that for the last 2 months I have asked him to take off or work later hours on a Sunday (not the whole weekend) to come support me and my sports team during a match. This is a group I have played with year-round for 5 years and they are like family to me. Hasn't made the effort once. Not to mention… next weekend is the season ending championships and our team party, which I clearly expressed I really wanted him to be a part of multiple times. I'm also hurt that after just including him in my experience with my friends, he then went on to contemplate a solo group trip without even making me feel considered. 

The feelings are fresh and I don't think I would do this, but the thought crossed my mind to tell him he isn't welcome on the trip with my friends anymore. I'm not sure if I am right to be so bothered and hurt by this, and I do feel shitty that I've toyed with the idea of cancelling on him.

Now complete the following example-
input: Occasionally, I'll forget minor stuff that is unimportant to me and this makes my wife angry - case in point is tonight when she asked if I knocked her hairspray onto the floor, and spilled some. I assume that she didn't do it (hence why she's asking) so it must have been me. I responded by saying I probably did, but don't remember (It was afterr I worked 9 hours, went to the gym, and had dinner, so I'm pretty tired and was just focused on showering at that point). Apparently this was the wrong answer.

She starts going off about how can I not remember something that happened a few hours ago, and swears I'm lying to her. How it would be implausible that I wouldn't hear it or remember picking it up. Frankly, I didn't and was just trying to be honest. I knock stuff over all the time - it doesn't stick out in my memory. 

First of all, what would be the benefit of me lying? We don't have kids, and the dog can't reach it. If it wasn't her, it was obviously me. The fact is that knocking something over is something that happens all the time. She has stuff on the counter and sometimes I'm not careful about avoiding it if I'm distracted or doing something else. 

Second, if I had remembered or realized at the time, I would have cleaned it up so she wouldn't notice and get pissed later. 

I made these points to her, but she was just busy being mad. I ended up cleaning it up, but she still kept going on about how there must be something wrong with me to not remember it and she was pissed at me for ""lying"" to her. Somehow this also became about me being ""holier than thou"" about her having stuff on the counter (apparently this is what she got from me saying that there is her stuff on the counter sometimes and sometimes I knock it over by accident). 

To me it seems like a huge overreaction. Why couldn't she just accept that I was trying to be honest by saying I don't remember, but I'll clean it up?  What really pisses me off the most is that she doesn't ever seem to think she does anything wrong and seems incapable of apologizing for blowing up on me. I apologize for not remembering and she jus stays pissed, with no admission of fault on her part for the argument.

So, AITA for not having a good enough memory of minor things I screw up?

Now complete the following example-
input:    So we got a new assistant manager at work and he is extremely rude and demanding. He’s a “my way or the highway” type of guy. Personally I get a long with him great(I have to try really hard to stay on his good side). However I do it to keep the peace at work. It’s not the same for my coworkers. He’s made two coworkers cry on different occasions. I noticed him messaging a manager from another store and a nasty message popped up and before he could minimize it I was able to read it. It said something making fun of our store manager. So I was curious and I waited for him to leave his computer unattended then I took it to the back and opened up the messages. I read a ton is extremely in appropriate and rude comments about my coworkers.... so I took photos of the messages and anonymously sent them to HR and CC’d our store manager (who was one of the people he spoke about negatively on the messages). His messages weren’t awful but definitely inappropriate for work. I feel bad because to his face I act really nice and innocent (like I’m on his side) however in reality I was looking for opportunities to “out” him. He is a good person just had a poor attitude and as much as he was being unfair, so we’re all of us. So I understand why he felt so negatively towards everyone. Sure it was inappropriate.... but should I have spoken with him and my store manager first, instead of sending it immediately to HR. Should I have sent in anonymously, and continued pretending as if I knew nothing? So far no action has been taken by HR. My store manager did speak with the 6 of us individually about the messages without revealing what was said. He mostly just asked how we felt about the assistant manager. He definitely spoke with the assistant manager and he is clearly scared he’s going to loose his job (he opened up to me about the situation).

input: I'm fat. Always been fat. Never been athletic. I was a book reading nerd. It happens sometimes. However, I have a good career, my own home, a paid off car, two lovely cats and a fiance of 4 years. He's Mexican. This is important.

I live in Texas and my mom lives in North Carolina. I work in a financial industry and my typical work clothes consist of all black, black slacks, black cardigan or jacket, mostly black blouses and black shoes. Black matches easily, looks professional.

I text my mom daily (I'm an only child and my dad is dead) and she asked to see my outfit that day. I mixed it up with floral print ponte pants, black top, black shoes.

""Colors look so slimming on you! They really hide your problem areas!""

Gee, thanks mom. I told her ""How many times have I had to tell you to not make comments about my weight?""

""well you just isn't know how to take a compliment, that's how I meant it, everyone has problem areas! That's how I take it when someone says that, now tell me something else shitty!""

""I've asked you a dozen times not to make comments about my weight and you never ever ever do""

""I hope you show some respect to your new HISPANIC family unlike me""

She's made comments before and was real excited when trump was screaming about a wall, so I know she would prefer a white guy for me. I've had to tell her a few times to shut up with the racist shit. Doesn't get me anywhere. She also loves my fiance and is always saying he's a handsome hardworking man and treats me like a princess. I don't understand the logic. 

So I hit her back with the ""Yep, you're a racist old bitch! Leave me alone until you can change your attitude.""

Now she's pissy and blowing up my phone for me trying to ruin Christmas, saying it's my fault and I have bad language.

AITA for not just letting her spew her bullshit and telling my mom to fuck off at Christmas? If it was a stranger off the street telling me I had problem areas and making backhanded comments about my ""Hispanic family"" I'd tell them to fuck off too. Did I ruin Christmas?

Now complete the following example-
input: So, for context, on Wednesdays at our school, we have this thing called 8th hour. School lets out 1 hour early, and we have about 1 hour until buses arrive. That one hour is called 8th hour and we can use it to do homework, basically do whatever.

In the morning, my friend asks me if he can play Smash Ultimate against me in the morning(I usually see him in the orchestra room every morning). I said yes, but I got there late and wasn't able to. So I just told him I could play during 8th hour.

So, come 8th hour, and it seems like there's a mock recital for the Solo and Ensemble performers going on in the orchestra room. Friend is still there. The orchestra teacher is giving tips on everything the performers need to fix, etc. So, I was wondering if I could still play on my Switch if this was going on? I saw multiple people on their phones and there were some people talking as well. So, I decided, if I turned the volume down and didn't talk loudly, it would be fine. So, I start the game. We played through one performance. It didn't seem like we had affected the performance in any way, and the orchestra teacher didn't notice as well. No one had called it out either, so I thought we were in the clear. But cue halfway through the second performance(we still hadn't said a word), teacher sees it, gets mad, and confiscates my Switch until the end of 8th hour, meaning I couldn't leave either. I still don't get why it was a major issue, because it had already been about 10 minutes of playing before she confiscated the Switch, and we didn't make any noise, and neither did the Switch. Not only that, she seemed to be okay with people being on their phones. But, I can see where I'd be in the wrong. So, AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: Earlier this year I (25F) hooked up with a guy at a party who’s mutual friends with a lot of my friends. I gave him my number but didn’t hear from him, so I figured he wasn’t interested especially as we were quite drunk.

Several months later after reconnecting at various events we both attended we started seeing each other and have since talked about that first night. He told me one of our friends (F) called him the next day and said that I wasn’t into him and regretted hooking up with him, which wasn’t at all true especially since I hadn’t even spoken to her since the party.

Apparently, she’s done various other kind of creepy things to him that make me think she was into him the whole time and purposely did it to sabotage us. We’ve been friends for years but I feel like she betrayed me especially since she called him literally the next day to tell him that.

I’ve accepted that I can’t trust her anymore and to be honest I’m upset and a bit angry. I feel like I should talk to her but I’m quite non-confrontational and I don’t want to make it a big deal of it in my friend group so I’ve just been avoiding her and not really inviting her to things anymore. I try and stay friendly when we see each other but it makes me feel hypocritical and two faced (an asshole). Also it’s been quite a while since it’s happened and she will definitely just lie about it or deflect so I don’t think its worth it.

Sorry this is all very highschool drama and I’m really not used to it. This is a throwaway btw, thanks for listening :)

TLDR: Friend told guy i wasn't into him behind my back and I feel betrayed. Now I don't want to be friends and am cutting her out

Now complete the following example-
input: I've been talking to this guy for a few weeks and we hit it off immediately. We even had a short coffee date during lunch break, and we were on the same vibe. He was funny, charming, similar sense of humor. Everything went great. I should add that we had sex talks as well, discussing kinks and stuff. 

So we decide to have a real date and then he asks if I'm on birth control. I think a few hours and cancel the date. He was confused saying it's just an innocent question, unlike all the stuff we talked about before. And we were both hinting that we will have sex on the first date, so what's wrong about birth control question?

My reasoning is this: if a guy is about to have sex with someone he just met, he MUST be jumping out of his way to use condom. It's a MUST no matter how many times we flirted dirty. And if he even thinks of not using a condom with a girl he just met, that means he was likely to do it before, which means he is at a much higher risk of having an STD and I'm not cool with that. 

I don't trust people who even entertain the idea of having sex with a person they don't know without a condom. I can't risk that even if he ends up using a condom. Doesn't matter that we discussed the sex positions or what we like in bed. I want to feel safe and I don't feel safe even if he thinks of not using a condom on a first date even for a second. 

Hope I explained my reasoning well. Question is - am I the asshole for that line of reasoning?

Now complete the following example-
input: I was falsely accused of rape in high school. While she never filed a police report, she did tell everyone. She did this because I live in a really religious community, and having sex before marriage is a big no no. (Mormon)

Well, we had sex in high school (consensual sex) and when her parents found out about us having sex, she pulled the rape card, so she wouldn’t get in trouble.

Rumors spread that we had sex, and she told everyone I raped her. Obviously this ruined the rest of my high school years. I had no friends. My life was ruined. 

After high school I left and moved 4 hours away. I deleted all social media, made new accounts with no high school followers, and started over. 

All of my new friends know nothing about this. When asked about how high school was or if I have any high school friends I simply just say “I was weird in high school, kind of lonely. Didn’t talk to anyone” and end it at that.

It’s been a couple years, and I’m in college. I recently had a girlfriend (we just broke up) for several months and I never told her anything about it. She wonders why I am so secretive about my past, made new social media, etc. 


So WIBTA if I never told my future girlfriends about this? I don’t want to risk it. I think they’ll have a thought in their head that I was lying about it, and I really raped her, etc etc. 


On another note, what should I do?

Now complete the following example-
input: I am a student at a medical university, and yesterday I was walking to the hospital building to get lunch. The main hospital lobby has a piano in it which people are welcome to play. (Usually people play nice classical pieces with soft melodies etc...)

When I walked in there was a group of 4 or so people around the piano and one guy playing. They were singing ""praise God, praise God"" at the top of their lungs to whatever tune the guy was playing on the piano. For some reason, as I walked by, I became irrationally angry at this. I kept thinking ""get your praise God BS out of this secular university hospital!!"" I'm annoyed again just thinking about it. I didn't say or do anything about it I just kept walking to the cafeteria, but other people that were walking by were smiling and clapping along, which annoyed me more. 


I think the reasons I'm annoyed are;
1) it's a secular university
2) it's a hospital lobby where other people are bound not to feel as happy as you do
3) if you're overjoyed about some good news it's likely the doctor you should be praising 
4) don't throw God in my face 

I feel like an asshole for getting this annoyed about it. I'd like to know if you all feel like I am too.

Now complete the following example-
input: [I am a 21M, girlfriend 21F] My side: Her and her best “guy friend” have been in a pretty volatile friendship, on and off fighting and not. So Thursday night, I drop her off at a party at his house. I have to get up early for work so I stay in. She says she wants to be home by 12, I said ok, text me when you’re home. 

At 1 am, she’s at the bar where he works at, posting kind of inappropriate pictures. No big deal, we talked about it whatever. 

We’ve had numerous problems in the past like this where she would go to bars and parties that she swore she didn’t want to be at; she was never there at any of the times (2,3,4 hours past when she said she would be leaving), and generally not who she said she would be with. She claims she was not going to any bars, but I wake up and always find her there. 

Two weeks ago, she’s suppose to be coming over. It’s late, 3-4 AM. She hasn’t shown yet, so I call, say I’m coming to pick her up. 4 am I arrive, she reads my message, never comes out. I wait 20-30 minutes, and she never comes out. She’s at the guys house. 

My roommate and very good friend, early in our relationship heard a rumor; At a bar, someone asked if she was single, she said no. Always kind of in the back of my head. 

Back to Thursday night / Friday afternoon. While in the tanning bed, I looked at her phone. I am obviously suspicious, and I feel have a reason to be. I found some videos of her and the guy friend laying on his bed, which I find extremely inappropriate. 

Her side of the story is she’s fine, and that her father, mother, and sister agree her friend is not threatening or inappropriate because they are such good friends. She believes she is rightfully mad because I was distrusting. 

AITA? I feel like she’s being extremely manipulative, and if I were to talk into the room with them she would absolutely know it was wrong.

She threatened to cut herself if I didn’t give mine to her first, which I thought was just an empty threat. Sends me a picture of a fake looking cut on her thumb. Goes even further, another one on her index, darker this time. I called her to confront her about it and she said random shit. Then sent me one with her palm bloodied. Now, this looked decently real and shit. When I asked about it more she said “OMG, can’t you tell it’s fake?”. No, I’m not joking. When I asked why, she said it was because I wouldn’t give her my address. Are you fucking kidding me?

Now complete the following example-
input: So, I met this guy, let’s call him JOHN in college.

Middle of my freshman year, I broke up with my hs boyfriend from home. The breakup was mutual and amicable at first, but took a turn once my ex heard I had started seeing other people after we broke up. So, JOHN, being a nice friend, moved a third mattress into his and his roommate’s  (ADAM) room for a week so I could be w my friends. 

Shortly after, I made out with ADAM, but clarified I didn’t want a relationship, and we only just kissed a few times. ADAM was livid because he told me he had strong feelings for me, and we didn’t end on good terms. I had set boundaries before that I didn’t want a relationship, but ended up hurting ADAM anyway. So, JOHN, took my defense and said ADAM was being a jerk about the whole thing. JOHN suggests I should’ve made out w him instead of ADAM, avoiding the drama I was currently in. He then tried to kiss me, and I dodged it, but we laughed it off, and I told him it would never happen. Totally fine and our friendship grew.

middle of my soph year, my new boyfriend (Carl), and I just broke up. My heart was broken, seriously. But JOHN, being the guy that he is, was there every second I needed. Took me shopping, for ice cream, invited me over to watch movies, ETC. I guess we “flirted” by doing stuff alone like watching movies and holding hands, but I never had romantic feelings and felt like I made it clear when he tried to kiss me previously. Over that winter break, JOHN and I talked almost everyday on FaceTime and texted all the time. He was all around a great friend, and I appreciated having him around, but he would casually say he loved me and kissed me a lot. On New Years, JOHN texted me a very long message saying that he was totally in love with me, that I’m the person he thinks about before he falls asleep and as soon as he wakes up, that I’m the most amazing person and girl he’s ever met, etc,. I responded thanking him, but that I wasn’t interested in something like that, and he accepted it, and we stayed friends.

after winter break, I got back together with Carl. Since JOHN had been there with me through all the BS, I thought it would be better for JOHN to hear from me that Carl and I are back together, so I told him. He told me that he needed space, blocked me on Instagram, completely ignored me anytime he saw me, and still does today, over a year later. I recently texted him to apologize for how things went down (although I feel as if I didn’t do much wrong), and he basically just said thanks. We had a great friendship, and it completely ended when I told him Carl and I were getting back together. We don’t even look at each other when we see each other, wave, say hi, nothing. 

So...AITA for the way I handled things with John? Or Adam? Ps, Carl and I broke up for good right after all of this.

My (F26) boyfriend (M25) have been together for almost a year now. At first it was amazing (definitely honeymoon phase) and that lasted a while. Lots of cuddling and intamacy (not talking about sexual). My love language is a Physical Touch with a dash of Words of Affirmation. His love language is solely Acts of Service. What started out as a very fulfilling physical relationship has turned to pretty much zero physical contact. I know he loves me, he says 'I love you' and he always cooks me dinner. He does the laundry so I have clean work clothes. He fixed my car in the middle of a snow storm. But he doesn't hug or kiss me unless I ask. And cuddling is right off the table. We sleep against either side of the bed. Its breaking my heart, and making me feel unwanted. I can rationalize it and tell myself he loves me but I dont't feel it. I'm having a hard time with the feeling of instant rejection when I go to cuddle in bed and he asks me not to.

input: This happened several years back. My best friend lived in another city with a bunch of mutual friends. Her then boyfriend lived abroad. He had planned something special for her birthday even though he wouldn't have been able to visit and he was in touch with the aforementioned mfs to help him. She visits my city, which happens to be both our hometown, the weekend before her birthday. I was asked by one mf to get one of her gifts as planned by the bf and I was told that I would be reimbursed. It was sort of an expensive gift, not exorbitant but definitely over the budget one would spend for a friend's birthday gift. So we went shopping, stopped by a place for the gift and I asked her to pick the one she liked. She selects one, loves it and I think, fine maybe we should get this. We decide to grab a bite before buying it. And while we were at the restaurant, I receive a call from the mf asking me to abort the plan and that the bf wanted to get it himself. So I forgot about it and when we were done shopping she stopped at the gift shop again, took the one she had picked first and was just kinda admiring it. So this is where I know I screwed up. I went ahead and got it for her anyway. My reasoning being anyway the initial plan was to have me get it so it should be fine and if the bf doesn't want that, it can still be a gift from me. That blew up. I understand that he wanted to get it for her, but it's not such a gift that you can have only one of it.(think handbag, shoes, plush toy). And anyway if her boyfriend got the same one it will surely be extra special. I apologised to both of them. But it ended badly and they ending up fighting. They both stopped talking to me and blocked me on all social media platforms. I truly felt awful, and I understand why the bf was upset but I still feel the reaction was a bit extreme. It was not like I planned to sabotage their special day. Please tell me, AITA?

Note: things are good with my friend now. She started talking to me again after a year and they broke up sometime after that for reasons unrelated.

Now complete the following example-
input: First time posting.

Getting right into it, about a year ago I met this girl at work. Let's call her Sam. Sam and I became friends pretty quickly as most people at our job are older. Sam deals with anxiety/ depression and doesn't have a lot of friends, so I made an effort to invite her to outtings with my friends outside of work, who are the most supportive humans I know. As we got closer and hungout more, it became pretty clear Sam liked me. Eventually, Sam told me this and I explained that I like being her friend, but was not interested in anything else, which Sam was cool with.

Fast forward a year later and I start to feel like Sam has become way too invested in me for being just a work friend. Examples include her leaving work early because I didn't grab lunch with her (we normally get food together) and Sam calling me out at work about how I haven't invited her places when I hangout with my friends.  

Recently, Sam has been telling me that she needed to talk to me about something important, but whenever i brought it up she would never say what it was. This happened about 6 times over the course of a month. Finally, this past weekend at about 4am her and two of my friends were at a bar and Sam told me that she loved me and has never felt this way before. I didn't say much bc my friends were right there. After several texts the next day Sam confirmed this was what she wanted to tell me. I told Sam that I need space and that we can't do lunch anymore but when It comes to being in the office together that I won't act any differently toward her. Sam has called out of work sick since this happened so I haven't seen her since. I feel Sam is way too emotiallly invested in me to the point where it is unhealthy which wad affecting me at work. I also realize Sam deals with a lot of health issues and has a very limited friend group. 

AITA for telling my work friend Sam I need space after she admitted she loved me?

Now complete the following example-
input: My group was assigned a project of making a poster for an engineering class, and I offered to my group to design the poster so that they could just add in the text and we would be finished. There only thing was that this project was assigned on a Thursday and I told them ahead of time that I wouldn't be able to work on it at all the entire weekend, so I was going to finish it by Friday. They all agreed and thanked me for it because I was the only person in my group that knew how to use Photoshop well. The same day that the project was assigned, my groupmates got together and did all of the research before I even got to contribute. Cool I guess, now all I need to do is design the poster! The only thing I didn't know was that my groupmates already had an idea in their head of what the poster should look like.

I spent a good 4 hours that night creating a poster for my group that I figured would suffice, but once I showed my group, they said that it wasn't what they were thinking, and asked me to change a few things. I was a little annoyed at that point but it wasn't that big of a deal, so I changed the few things that they wanted the next day and showed them what I had changed. I got a message back a few hours later that they had gotten together and changed a few things about their poster concept and asked me to change some more, and even asked me to replace a part of what I had made with someone else's, that didn't even fit the rest of the design. 

At this point it was already Friday night and I didn't have much more time left, so on Saturday I just added all of the information and graphs to my original design and sent it to them saying that it was going to need to do because I didn't have any more time to work on this. They decided to message me back saying that they were just going to do it by hand and that it wasn't a big deal, and I'm still pissed off that I wasted a good 5 hours working on something that my group isn't even going to use. I attached a picture of what I made so that at least someone could see it. It's definitely not my best work and was really rushed, but I still think it would have gotten us a good grade.

Now complete the following example-
input: TL;DR at bottom.

So this is a bit complex, let me fill you in on background- we are both non-confrontational people. The disputes prior to this were minor. Let me also add that I absolutely **despise** lying. This has been difficult at times, as she was abused, emotionally and physically, in past relationships, and lies chronically to save herself from retribution of her SO. This behavior is well ingrained in her personality, however I have made leaps and bounds towards ending these behaviors and promoting honesty in our relationship. One of the results of her abuse however is her fear of upsetting me. (Let me add I have never and will never lay a hand on her in anger.) This fear manifests itself as her withholding information she fears will upset me, thus leading her to lie. This has nearly ceased over the past few months.

Til tonight.

We have an extremely active sexual life, as it was in part some similar kinks that first jump started our relationship. We are a long distance relationship, so maintaining our sexual activities is heavily reliant on Skype based ""playtime"" which between our visits slates our thirst for one another. Without going into detail these consist of me telling her precisely what to do while we both pleasure ourselves in tandem. I have a good sense of her 'rhythm' and would compliment this with questions asking her if she was close etc. to time my commands accordingly. I thought I had it down.

*Thought.*

Recently, I purchased a toy for her that aides our bedroom escapades. This has given her some genuinely astounding experiences. However, during the post-playtime glow of endorphins, she broke down crying and told me something long the lines of ""I'm so sorry OP... I know you told me never to lie or fake anything (referencing a prior conversation about faking smiles for the same reasons) but I normally fake every orgasm you see me have."" She then goes on to explain that this toy that I purchased for her has given her the best sexual experiences of her life. She explains that most girls fake orgasms through anything but penetration (a fact I know well) but this whole time I assumed she was one of the rare few who could.

Reasoning for said upsettness- ~~(English lvl. 100)~~ At the outset I specifically stated she should never lie or fake an orgasm to please me. I repeated this often. She reassured me every time I voiced these wishes that she wouldn't. She defied this. I am extremely hurt she openly defied my wishes and lied to me regularly in regards to a portion of our relationship that due to its nature is interconnected to practically all other aspects. She faked it. Lied to me every time. I am oddly hurt and angry.

TL;DR- So, proctologist pros. Am I the asshole for being hurt and angry with my SO for lying practically every day about truly orgasming to 'please' me due to Pavlovian conditioning form past abusive relationships?

Now complete the following example-
input: A girl I dated a few years ago and I have remained good friends since our breakup. I've still had romantic feelings for her since then and the past 2 years she's been dating this guy that nobody seems to understand them as a couple. I've never cared for the guy despite my best efforts. I want to support her more than anything and if she's happy that's great.

I've known the past few months things between them have been pretty rocks with multiple times of them almost breaking up. They have an apartment together and their lease runs up this summer, so staying together for the time being makes sense on a lot of levels.

Last weekend I get a call from her at 1030pm asking if I can come over because she might need some help. 20 minutes I show up and knock on the door, she comes out with her dog on a leash and wearing a hat. She is clearly upset and after we start a walk she says that he hit her.

I ask if it was open handed or a fist (not that it matters) and she doesn't know, she just knows her cheekbone hurts. Apparently they were is a super heavy argument, which has become the norm lately, and she shoved him. His response, from his perspective, was he tried hitting her hat off her head. But then she tells me this isn't the first time he's hit her but the second time.  After about a 45 minute walk she goes back to the apartment.  

Since then I don't know much about their interactions hut I've understood she has been looking around for a new place. She's been staying in the spare bedroom and he's been in the master.

I had an opportunity to see him tonight at a social event and in private I approached him, stating if he touched her again he's gonna wind up in a hospital. He asks if she told me what happens and I say ""yes she told me. Get home safely"" and then walk away, to which he responds FU.

2 hours later I check my phone and have 3 missed calls from her and a text saying ""wtf""

I haven't been able to talk to her since then, but AITA for stepping in? I just want to protect my friend, romantic feelings aside. How could she interpret this to make me out to be the bad guy?

So this story starts back in January of this year. My gf and I had been together for a few months and prom was coming up. She had never properly been asked to a dance before so I wanted it to be special. I spent about three hours making a poster with the word ""prom?"" On it in several different color patterns. She happily agrees to go with me. Everything is fine until a few days ago, when my gf and I were walking together. A mutual friend of ours stops us and tells my gf that she got the go ahead from our VP and all they'd have to do is get their prom tickets. When I inquired wtf she was talking about, gf chimes in saying she was taking other girl to prom so she could go (at least a month after she already agreed to go with me). When I asked her when she was planning on telling me, she responded that she had been meaning to, but hadn't since she figured I wouldn't mind. After that I walked away and didn't hear any more of it. 
(Not worried about her cheating on me or anything, just upset that she agreed to this without telling me and assumed I wouldn't mind)
Is this no big deal? Am I overreacting? I just need some unbiased opinions on this situation. Also this is my first post so I'm sorry if I do something wrong.

Now complete the following example-
input: My SIL is having a hard time getting pregnant. It's been a year since she started trying and she has become angry and bitter that she isn't pregnant. 

She openly admits to hating pregnant women now bc she isnt pregnant. 

SIL never liked my sister very much, but liked her even less when sister got pregnant. Now when my sister comes to visit my parents (SIL and my brother live with my parents) SIL avoids seeing her and goes to the basement in her room and cries. 

Things SIL has done to make baby talk uncomfortable:
* tells my mom to not leave baby stuff where she can see it.
* tells my mom she cant make baby blankets in the living room,  since seeing them upsets her.
* closes the door to the spare bedroom bc she doesnt want to see the baby stuff in it. 
* is mean when she gets a baby shower invite or someone she knows gets pregnant. 

Etc.

I get along with my SIL, even tho she is admittedly kind of a b*tch.  So when I found out I was pregnant, I was hesitant to tell her and my brother. 

A month ago I was visiting my parents and they (sil/bro)  asked me if I was pregnant. I panicked and said no. In truth I was 2 months. 

(Mom tells me later that after I tell them I'm not pregnant, bro and SIL talk about it and feel bad that I'm having a hard time getting pregnant too. They sympathize with me.)

I felt bad lying but I didn't know how to tell them. I was sure if I told her she would cry and make a scene and not want anything to do with me anymore. 

The next day I talked to my brother and told him I was pregnant and I was sorry for lying. I explained that I was worried about SIL and if she would hate me knowing I was pregnant. He said not to worry and he would talk to her. 

After talking to his wife, they decide they are mad at me for lying? 

So today, a month after, I have another doc appt and come visit my parents. SIL walks into the house and I say hello, as usual. She walks right by me as if I were invisible and ignores me completely. She goes to the basement and I never see her again for the rest of the day.

I realize I shouldn't have lied,  and I apologized and explained why I did so. But doesnt this prove my point? 

Or am I the asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm finishing an exchange program soon and hence moving out of the dorm I lived in for the past year.

However, I recently discovered through my roommate who moved out earlier that the rent payment system here is so bad that the university staff in charge of the student dorms actually have no way of checking whether you've paid the rent or not. The way this works is each month tenants get sent a slip to take to the post office, pay the rent in cash, and then hand the blank slip back to the university. Because of this, my friend who already moved back to his home country got away with not paying rent for half the year.

I thought this was just plain dumb. The thing is, I can afford to pay the last month's worth of rent, but having such a big loophole makes me want to just save myself the money. My friend on the other hand didn't pay because he didn't have cash and the university wouldn't accept credit or bank transfers. 

On the payment due date I just walked into the office, handed in the blank slip, and when they assumed I had paid I just walked out. I feel morally conflicted as technically I cheated them, but at the same time it's difficult to feel bad for making a public university lose a sum of pocket change. If my dorm was privately owned or something, I don't think I would have felt the same. If anything I kind of want to blame the university for having such dodgy management in the first place. 

So Reddit, AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: I came home tonight and my wife was telling me about her day. One item she recalled was going to target, and she specifically mentioned getting meyer's clean day soap. The last time meyer's clean day soap was purchased was the first time we purchased it for our house - she specifically requested for me to get it. I had asked, ""which variety"" and she had told me, ""any"" I then, like an idiot got different varieties of dish and hand soap, ruining the aesthetic she was trying to present in our kitchen. (never expressed to me.  No fight from this)

Anyways, that left us with extra of this expensive dish soap, which I thought we would use next and just get matching hand soap for that time.

So, she mentions she got new dish and hand soap, and I replied with ""ooh, remember that I got that other one last time that we should probably use?""

Her tone then becomes annoyed with me and she says that's not the one she likes and she got the variety she likes. At this point, I'm confused because regardless of whether it's her favorite variety or not, we should use that first. However, now I'm feeling a heavy bad attitude coming from her - my assumption (from our usual poor communication) is that she feels accused of a bad memory or lack of observation in our daily life by me. (She thinks I'm saying she didn't remember we had the extra soap and that she's stupid for it.)

So, after asking why she's perturbed, and verifying it is because she is upset about me asking a question about whether she may have forgotten the extra soap (she told me that my questioning of her was rude/offensive) I try to explain myself in hopes of setting the record straight, because I had absolutely no intention of passing any judgment about whether she knew the soap was there or not. 3x I explain that me asking why she got new soap was not me accusing her or having a poor memory or not being observant, and that it was simply because I could easily imagine MYSELF forgetting the extra soap was there that I asked that question. Each time, she answers in a fashion that ignores my explanation, and only escalates her frustration with me. I am remaining calm in my explanation the entire time, and quite honestly, begging to be understood.

Probably shouldn't have bothered explaining, but not being understood makes me feel utterly empty and disrespected / marginalized / villainized.

Anyways, this ends in her giving me ""advice"" as to how I could approach the situation better, while she spoke of each of us only being able worry about ourselves in the situation and that the only way something like this would improve in the future was for us both to work on our own end. (which I agree with, but paired with the ""advice"" to me on how to approach it, and no outward recognition about what she could have done different to help, seems quite hypocritical.)

Anyways, AITA?

Any thoughts are appreciated here. I really need the sanity check, even if it's hard truth for me to face.

Thank you.

Now complete the following example-
input: So basically, I'm an only child and I'm very close to my parents. I was living far away from home and working for a while but I ended up getting very depressed after some years and quit my job. I moved back home to live my parents for a while until I find a new job.   


My mom is pretty much the breadwinner of the family and runs a business and my dad helps her with the documents and stuff like that. She grew her business from practically nothing and now she's doing really well – in fact, her efforts and her business are the only reason I was even able to go to college (she paid for everything). I really am very proud of her because she made it big and that's hard for a woman to do because the country/ community I live in is super patriarchal and male chauvinistic.   


Anyway now she sees me – a jobless 24 year old/ with no direction in life/ looking for a new job and she starts hinting that I should join her business and take over the company. I totally understand why she would want me to continue her legacy but I honestly have no interest/ aptitude for the kind of business she's in. I think I would be really unhappy working with her/ for her. She is a great mom and we love each other, but she is super controlling and dominating and I know we would fight all the time if we worked together. But still, she insists that I'd be great at the business....   


I'm a digital designer so I try to help out in whatever way I can, like I'm building a website for her company. But I just don't see myself actually joining the business and dealing with all her stuck up clients. And today she asked me to come to this big company event and I was definitely going to be there but then we ended up fighting over a stupid thing (which was my fault) and then she starts yelling at me about how I don't do anything for her and how I'm useless. Later in the day, I text her saying I'm not coming. That was shitty of me because I know she wanted me to be there. And then she texts me back saying she never expects anything from me because I'm a disappointment.  


ANYWAY. I guess I'd just really like to know whether I'm an asshole for not helping her with work/ continuing her legacy/ and just generally not being there for her after she has done so much for me.

input: My friend had 3 positive dollar store pregnancy tests and was on birth control. If it's true, she's only 4-5 weeks along. She has one child already and is really struggling financially. I have bought her groceries on multiple occasions and pay for her to eat every time we go out.  
She took the tests because she believed her abusive boyfriend and his buddy tampered with her birth control. I believe this to be true. She was very upset when she found out, but as soon as she told the boyfriend, she became excited. She did not want another child yet until she found out she was going to have one and he brainwashed her into thinking this was what she wants. She refuses to terminate or give the baby up even though she can barely afford to care for the child she has. She wants to give her boyfriend another child like he wants. 

I have mixed emotions about all of this, but I ultimately am disappointed in her and I'm annoyed that she is not living her life for herself. Nothing she does is for her own happiness, it's all for her boyfriend. She could have a great job with her degree, but because her boyfriend wants her to work at \[insert big department store here\] with him, she won't look for another job. He wants her there so she doesn't make much money and so that they are eligible for government assistance. He will not get a better job to support her either. 

I have not expressed my feelings to her and I don't know that I would tell her I feel this way unless I was certain that I'd be okay with never speaking to her again. It's bothering me because she's not acting like herself. I am tempted to end the friendship. I feel guilty for being so annoyed, but I want her to be better. Am I an asshole for feeling this way?

Now complete the following example-
input: Sorry for the long post but tl;dr near the bottom.

I enrolled in a project course at my college back in May. The timeframe is flexible: you decide with your professor how long the course should be (up to 1 year), and that determines how much work must be in it, how harsh it's marked, etc. It's expected to at least be graduate level quality. I decided with my professor I only wanted to devote four months to it, as it corresponded to the spring/summer months and if it were longer, my other courses would interfere with it.

Part of these courses is you go in with a project proposal, it's accepted or declined, and if it's accepted, you do only what you defined in your proposal. To make it more manageable, you can define due dates for portions of the project and a proposed marking scheme. Everything was accepted and off I went.

Over the months and after updating my professor with my progress, demonstrating my work, and discussion meetings with him, he kept asking for more and more. He loved my work but thought I could make so and so adjustments to my proposal and implement them. I was keen on the idea as it could mean better marks. If he liked my work, surely encompassing even more would be better? He continually told me to not worry about the due dates so much and instead focus on adding abc or xyz to my project and just updating him with the progress.

I took his advice. I missed deadlines by weeks. It got to the point where the final due date approached and he told me again and again don't worry about it, just keep working. It worried me because I was soon starting a full courseload but still kept going anyways. It became difficult to manage what is basically a mini-thesis alongside a 15hr/week schedule of lectures and labs, but since I was assured to not worry about deadlines (I assumed my 4 months would end up being 8-10 months), I spread things out a bit.

On November 1st, I was abruptly told through e-mail that I have exactly two weeks to submit everything. At this point, my project was completely different from what I originally planned to do, and I wasn't finished. I mean, I finished what I set out to do originally but not the added stuff my professor convinced me to do. I had to rush things and admittedly submitted subpar work to my standards. In my summary paper, it was clear things were in disarray but I had a time frame all of a sudden when previously I didn't.

I ended up getting a 20%, not only failing but killing my GPA. I was told it had ""no academic merit"" and he was ""embarrassed"" to be part of it. He said he would never work with me again. How much this hurt me was indescribable: he was my favorite professor, an inspiring force in previous classes I had with him, and we were on a first name basis to top it off. He never replied to my e-mails.

#tl;dr

Signed up for a 4-month course with my favorite professor. He told me to not worry about the 4-months and take as much time as I need to add things to my project not originally in the project scope. I did my best until was abruptly told to hand it in and I submitted poor work. I failed.

#end tl;dr

WIBTA if I appealed his grade? Normal procedure is to hand in material verbatim, but since I got my mark, I've still been working on the project, even knowing I've failed. What I would have considered 55-60% grade material back then I firmly believe is 80-90% material. If I appealed, I would obviously hand in my revised work. The supervising professor left the country for sabbatical and would otherwise be unable to verify the same work was handed in. He's going to look bad and cannot defend himself.

Even if I was caught handing in different work, I have a strong case I think for a re-evaluation:

- I have documented proof of him stating to not worry about deadlines
- likewise I have proof of him expressing desire for project expansion, which AFAIK is allowed but should warrant extensions
- and I have proof he looked at my source code but I didn't even submit it. He marked strictly off my report

Now complete the following example-
input: Pretty low impact one here but I thought reddit might enjoy it. My girlfriend, her mom, and my mom teamed up to get me a Nintendo Switch and Mario Odyssey for Christmas! Super surprised, I was wanting one bad and hunting down good deals with no luck. Very grateful for that. We've been playing it a bunch since getting it with me holding the sticks for most of the time (video games, especially Nintendo/Mario, have been a huge part of my life ever since the original). My SO is entertained by video games but usually gets bored after 15 minutes and moves onto something else. I get way into it, and I am WAY into Odyssey. 

I had been talking about this level called ""New Donk City"" and how hilarious that name was, how I couldn't wait to get there, etc. Today, I was at a rehearsal (I'm a musician), and after a bit of playing I see a text from my SO from an hour prior. It basically said ""Hey we're playing New Donk City \[oops emoji\], do you want us to not beat it?"" (we have friends in town). I obviously put my drumsticks down and responding ""Wait! No! I want to play it!"" It was too late.

Later on speakerphone I very calmly and light heartedly said ""Hey, I really wanted to play that level, I was looking forward to it. How many moons did y'all get?"" She said ""...all of them"". I calmly said something like ""aw man"", and she proceeded to shrug it off saying things like ""whatever you can just replay it who cares?"" And I said ""Well the level will have changed and the collectables will be grayed out"", to which she said ""Oh well just start over then I don't know"". I stayed calm and said, see y'all later, bye! 

I then texted her very respectfully how it made me feel and that though she may find video games insignificant, they are very important in my life and I was very excited to experience this one fresh. She, through a few texts, got defensive, and even tried to guilt me into feeling bad about the way I felt a couple times. Things like ""K well everyone is freaking out over here now"" and ""I get it Aaron obviously we wouldn't have done it if we knew you would be like this"". To be clear, I simply stated that I was upset by what she did knowing how important the game was to me. I said that we'll just start a new file and replay it all (honestly, I'm okay with that). She still has not apologized for playing without me nor the way she handled the situation, and she's seeming like she has no intention to do so. This is what's getting me. 

So. Am I the asshole here? Like I know I've said it a thousand times how calmly I handled this (rare form for me), but am I an inherent asshole for getting upset by this? I know it's ""just a game"" and all, but she knows how much work I've put into the game and how clearly enthralled I was with exploring everything. She's an awesome person who is generally very in touch with approaching conflicts and all that, which is making me think I might be the asshole. Let me know, y'all.

Now complete the following example-
input: Buckle up folks because this is a long one. 

So about 2 and a half years ago I reconnected with a girl I met online from canada that really seemed to click with me, we shared alot of personal interests, links, etc. She was in this on off thing with another guy and living with an abusive father. She sends me a nude which causes the on off guy to flip out on me over Skype and I not wanting drama backed off for awhile but something about her hooked me like a drug. We start talking again and she says she wants to be with me and builds up the idea of a dream future. I'm into it naturally but she seems really avoidant of making our status known to anyone which is fine, shes got that weird ex right? So I message a mutual friend and he blows up and starts a shitstorm of drama because she was evidently sexting him, the ex, and making plans with me. I have alot of drama in the place I'm living at the time and see red flags so I deuce and end up in another relationship that I rapidly lose interest in but hang around because it's better than where I was before (I am the asshole for that I know) 

Jump forward 6-7 months and she starts messaging me on Skype again and we reconnect as friends and I tell her I still think about her and flirt a bit, a week or two later she sends a picture of her wet panties to my Skype while I'm at work and current gf sees it at home and almost kicks me out making me homeless across the country from family so once again seeing a red flag I block her on everything, 4 months later current gf cheats on me when I play fallout 4 after it comes out for 3days so I say screw it and deuce. Being in a bad place mentally and stuck moving in with parents again because my car died in a flood and I didnt have much money, i cant stop thinking about Canada girl so i unblock and message her, shes moved out of her dads, broken things off with the ex more completely and now has an american trucker friend paying for her apartment while she is slowly slipping into depression from abusive father and ex(he had been visiting her a few times at this point) we hit it off again and trauma bound over childhood stuff (toxic abusive mother and constant fighting as i grew up with step dad) and one day she just vanishes for 18 hours and I panic because shes had several prior suicide attempts. I call numerous people trying to figure out if shes okay including a guy who she hung out with irl sometimes, he flips out on me and tries to tell me to go find an american girl so that sets off a weird flag... she calls me a short time later with a black eye and mad I contacted her friend up there (I somehow ignored alot of red flags) 

Suddenly she drops a bomb on me, her dad showed up and hit her ""accidentally"" because she wouldn't hug him and she also breaks down and informs me of just how abusive he was when she lived with him. In the following month she spirals out hardcore, trucker friend lost job, she isnt working, food runs out, shes starving slowly to death, suddenly starts acting really strange and informs me she ordered helium to off herself. I call a crisis team immediately because I've fallen hard at this point and I've lost several friends to suicide so its terrifying to just let someone go through that, cop and psych lady show up, ask questions, she convinces things are fine and they leave. She panics after because she self medicated for epilepsy with weed and didnt want to get in trouble but she also cancels the helium order.

At this point she starts disappearing on me again but I dont give up because I'm terrified she'll off herself. Turns out shes talking to abusive ex again, so I in my infinite wisdom, somehow get roped into a 3 way relationship for the sake of getting her away from stalker father and not ending up homeless or starving to death. Trucker guy also has job again at this point and wants to help too (hes her friend of 15 years who has always been hung up on her but she refuses to date because shes not into him) 

SO the first 3 months of the 2 year shit saga begin... I fly up, the other 2 drive up a week later, I help her get her passport renewed, clean up her apartment (which is a disgusting wreck, she was letting her dog shit on the balcony and it was like 4 inches thick but I was in the army and a plumber at one point so fuck it, shes been through some fucked up shit, I'll clean the place nbd) she meanwhile fucks me like crazy and ignored her ex and tells me she just roped him in to help get this all done (hes already been a sleezebag, I moved in with him shortly before going up to Canada and his place was a shithole too and I guess I have a bleeding heart) and shed drop him after. So first we drive all the way to trucker guys hometown with ex guy trying to sexualize her and grope her every chance he got despite her trauma and her not initiating and obviously being uncomfortable and telling him to stop.

After a weird argument there with her being pissed with everyone but me; me her and ex continue to his place against everything she had told me before, basically I end up having 2 or 3 threesomes minus the fact the guy gives a weird vibe, her and ex start having arguments that spiral into insanity and end with her locking herself in the bathroom and self harming(no shame, just stating for clarity) and only allowing me In to calm her down, he knocks her up but we dont know it at the time (I'm sterile from birth because mom smoked and drank while pregnant, its caused 2 other relationships to end which is why I got tested because having a kid wasnt working out) and she starts getting really sick he takes her to hospital while I'm at work and i get a call saying he ""lost her"" she freaked out and had an argument and let her walk off in a major city by herself in a delirious state and she gets lost and almost snatched but she goes knocking on doors and a stranger helps her back. A day or two later upset at him, she goes through his laptop and desktop. First she finds out he cheated on her with 14 other people and then she finds 10 gigs of .... well some shit you just cant fucking unsee. It's all I can do not to kill the bastard and I feel sick af about everything, she blows up his Facebook, he comes home, immediately wipes hard drives and destroys computers while we pack up and gtfo.

Queue Feb of 2017, it's already been the most insane shit I've ever been apart of in my life, but she has me hooked and convinced we need eachother. We move up to Trucker guys hometown and he helps us get set up before she starts getting really sick again (we hadn't been eating well at this point because money got drained away by her ""needing"" weed, bills and ex guy being literal garbage) so we take her to a hospital there, she finds out shes 3-4 months pregnant and insists on abortion because it's ex guys kid and hes a pedo. I personally do not support abortion myself but I do believe in your body your choice. We end up going to the wrong clinic and it gets botched, she almost bleeds out but makes it, recovery is long and I spend the next few months keeping the house somewhat clean (I've been the only one cleaning since this started) and we have a backyard now so I lax on walking the dogs. Meanwhile with no vehicle I've found a job 1.5 miles away from the house at a mcdonalds and it's the best I can do but I'm walking there and back every day and I start losing steam on keeping up with the housework solo while she recovers for the next 3-4 months evidently, in this time I catch her flirting with other guys online and lying to me about things, she also caught me apologizing to my previous ex in secret because with what I've let go at this point, breaking up with her and deucing seemed pretty shit.

Shes not getting periods at this point, something is wrong, not pregnancy, some super rare shit where uterine tissue turns into bone and it blocks the way. So she has to have another surgery around this time last year, they fail at fixing it and retry (successfully) a few weeks later and she has to have a catheter for a week, in this time period she told me shed leave if I didnt let her have an open relationship and I caved because I have problems and we've already been through so much and she still talks about suicide. I say it's okay as long as I'm informed/involved and she starts acting shady. I had work the day of the first surgery and I came home and had a weird feeling after some recent arguments about her suddenly telling me shes poly and how I'm not meeting her needs (but she doesnt want to have sex at this point because pain, ex, trauma, etc.) And I find out shes been lying to me about video chatting with a guy who bought her a vibrator and she was sexting him the whole time and logs prior to her getting me to agree to the open relationship thing (meanwhile i have no desire to pursue anyone else, I have enough to deal with) so I send her a text saying ""we need to talk"" and she flips out and says I'm a piece of shit for causing her anxiety when she just had surgery and it turns into the first of many terrible arguments where she turns everything around on me. Christmas eve me and trucker guy have been making trips to Colorado to get her weed, the red a horrible blizzard, hes a dumbass and I warn him to slow down and we get into an almost fatal wreck with the trailer of a semi, trucks totaled, hes fine, I have bruised ribs from bouncing off center console (get a Ford f150 if you wanna feel safe lol) we have to jump through some hoops but we make it home in time for xmas, a few days later shes picking fights about me walking the dogs or doing housework because she just had surgery but I'm still going to my new job at a phone store making more money and supporting us both with bruised ribs which is agony in and of itself, fast forward (there's alot of fights she starts over minor shit

Now complete the following example-
input: My class (Grade 9) is the oldest class in my school, and we've been under the same advisor since Grade 7. The Grade 10 are supposed to be the oldest, but my school is small, and has so little students that whole classes are empty. Since no one is in Gr 10, all responsibilities given to the seniors, such as looking after the lower years, helping plan for school events, and filling in for teachers, is dumped on us. Our advisor entrusts me and the other officers of our class (I am the class secretary) to manage the class, and rarely ever helps us, which is understandable considering that my school's staff is limited and she has to teach five other classes. 

She has been our advisor for three years, and has dealt with a lot of our shit, so sometimes she gets mad at us for the smallest reasons because she's really tired of us as she has voiced out countless times. This week, my class has been preparing for an outing for our assigned clubs. Combined with our other projects that we had to submit within the week, we were all really tired. Usually, in the mornings when we wait for our first subject teacher, we like to mess around and talk before lectures start. This morning we were particularly noisy, our advisor comes up, yelling ""WHO'S SCREAMING?"" then accuses a girl who's known for being loud. She goes apeshit, kicks over our trashcan, pushes stuff off the teachers' table, and breaks her own glasses. She rants to us how tired she is because the coordinator of events of my school is absent and that she has to take care of the outing, then starts calling us inconsiderate for not helping, despite the fact that it was us who planned it in the first place. She starts crying, makes someone call in the Gr 7, the only other highschool class. After humiliating us in front of the Gr 7 and FINALLY giving the announcement she was supposed to give, she lets them go back and starts saying we're so irresponsible, that we're the worst batch she's ever handled, then says ""I hate to compare, but it's true."" She says how we were abusing her because, and that we should be good to her because she's our ""second parent"". She opens an open forum and tells us to say what we have against her and she say what she doesn't like about us. We didn't say anything. She starts pointing at my classmates one by one, calling them immature, lacking in common sense, and even called someone stupid. She tells our class president, who literally busts his ass everyday, that choosing him as president was a mistake. Then she asks us what we want and suggests that we cut ties so she'll be nothing but a subject teacher. I say it's a good idea. It's for the best anyway, because obviously she can't handle us, and we're just as tired of her as she is of us. She just walks out.

Later, another teacher comes up and informs us that her BP was high because of us, and if something happens to her, it was our fault and that we would pay for her if she goes to the hospital.

Now complete the following example-
input: I’ve known this girl, let’s call her Sally, for about 3 years now. She used to live close to me but moved to another state for a job, but we text everyday. Throughout this time she’s graduated with a doctoral degree, went through a residency, got a job, etc. Also through all of this she has complained, incessantly, about anything and everything. She hated her residency, she hates her job, etc. I complain about my own job, too, so I can understand, but it was honestly all day, everyday.

Recently, she had a baby with a guy she knew for about 2-3 months? Since she got pregnant and had the baby, the complaining has gotten 10x worse, and it’s harder to hold my tongue. She doesn’t like something the baby daddy did, she doesn’t like his family, etc. She’s sent me video of her family fighting with the baby screaming in the background. It’s just exhausting because I’m expected to give emotional support and advice what seems like 24 hours a day. If I have any sort of issue that I complain about, she brushes it off.

Anyway, onto the wedding thing. We’re going to a mutual friend’s wedding in May and I feel like I have to continue to be civil until then, because I don’t want to ruin said friend’s wedding with any awkwardness. I just really want to end the friendship, but have no idea what to do since I have to see her in person soon. Would I be the asshole if I just kept things civil then cut off contact?

Now complete the following example-
input: Basically I'm facing a bit of an ethical dilemma and I'm pretty deep into this emotionally so who better to ask than the internet? At the core, my question is WIBTA if I were to tell the ""baby daddy"" of my ex-best friend that he is most likely not the father, and at the very least he needs to get a DNA test done to confirm it before he throws his life down the drain? Seems like an easier question, but tbh my main motivating force behind this is revenge against my best friend, so that seems....conflicting.

My best friend is in her early 20's. I'm in my 30's, and male. A bit unorthodox, but we've had a strangely open and honest, close connection since we met, the age thing never bothered either of us, so we've just gone with it. It works for us. But we are in different places of our lives obviously. She's trying to be young and free and I'm looking more to settle down. I also have things figured out a lot more and she's trying to find herself and be young and free. So she is always needing support. Sometimes financially, and I've helped her with bills before, but mostly just always being there for her, being supportive, encouraging, and helping her see herself the way I see her when she's depressed. She is not able to do a lot of these things for me; she's been surrounded by garbage people her whole life that treat her like trash so I don't think she's ever really learned how to be a good friend. But I don't need the support usually the way she does, and we've talked about it honestly with each other, and she tries, and works to be better, so it didn't seem like a big deal usually. 

Glossing over a lot of drama (cuz she always has drama), I catch feelings and fall for her. We've always been flirty since the beginning, and we've gone back and forth on the dating thing, but thru it all we've been able to talk openly and honestly with each other so we've remained best friends. She doesn't feel the same way, but has off and on had romantic feelings for me according to her and has gone back and forth on it. 

We end up having a fight (reason not too important, basically she told me she wanted to try a relationship then a week later told me she only said that to make sure I stayed her friend and so I wouldn't leave to go back on the road for work),  and she ghosts me for a couple weeks. She supposedly gets pregnant during this time with ""baby daddy"". The night of our fight tho, she had taken a pregnancy test cuz she was worried she was pregnant with a guy she had broken up with right before I got back and she wanted us to try. She had sex with him up to a couple days before the test was taken. 

I was suspicious from the beginning that it was really baby daddy's kid. She and I started talking again when she found out she was pregnant and then baby daddy ghosted her a week or two later cuz she wouldn't have an abortion. He was in college, came from a good family, and his parents saw her as white trash that was wrecking their sons life. I was a bit more distant when we started talking again cuz I felt like I could no longer trust her, but I felt bad for her situation and still cared a lot about her so I tried to help how I could. 

So we're getting back into things over the next couple months, getting very close again, and start looking for an apartment together. I still have the feelings, she's still back and forth, but I just want my best friend to have a safe, good home while she's pregnant since she's basically couch surfing at this point after getting evicted. 

So everything is good, I'm being crazy supportive again, we're having good times, I'm going to her doctors appointments with her, we're planning a home, baby daddy is nowhere to be found. Then as she's texting me pics of the place we are getting while I'm at work, she blows up about a flirty joke I send her. Says she doesn't want to be in a relationship with me, never will, and the apt is off the table. She said she only told me there was a chance between us to make me happy. It had taken a lot for her to regain my trust and I felt like our lives were moving in a good direction, she and I had talked a lot about how even if we weren't in a relationship she wanted me to be there as a male role model and doing all the pregnancy stuff with her had made me start getting really attached to the idea of having that kid around. And she knows I want kids. It doesnt help that im in love with her and we were planning a home. It was incredibly vulnerable territory for me emotionally, but i was trying to do the best i could so she was taken care of. All that was gone in the space of 20 minutes, for what I felt like was no reason. 

I asked her the next day what the hell happened. Her response is that baby daddy had shown back up, told her he loved her and wanted to be a family. I told her she was being an idiot. We tried to work things out for a day or two, but I was feeling incredibly hurt, incredibly betrayed (I already had massive trust issues she knew about), and she was dead set on never anything romantic and she couldn't see past my feelings for her. So she blocked me on everything and ghosted me. 

The other day I noticed the time stamp on a picture I had of her, worked some math in my head, and realized her supposed conception date was literally the day after she had taken her pregnancy test. I am almost 100% certain at this point it is not baby daddy's kid. I am feeling hurt beyond belief, I feel like I lost my best friend for not a very good reason at all, and I feel like she was just using me this whole time for financial and emotional support. She won't talk to me, won't talk about what happened with our mutual friends, and offers no explanation. So I'm feeling super used and betrayed. I know if this guy finds out its not his kid that he'll happily bail. He never wanted the kid in the first place and she and him had been done before she discovered she was pregnant. Telling him will blow up her world and cause her immeasurable grief. I want revenge, as petty as that sounds, for being such an incredible friend to her and always being there for her no matter what hurt it caused me, and then her dropping the friendship like it meant nothing. That would make me an asshole, but the ethical dilemma is should the ""baby daddy"" be told the truth so he knows? I would think if I was not involved that he should be told for his own happiness, but I have to admit my driving force is revenge. 

So yea, WIBTA for telling the ""baby daddy"" of my ex-best friend that it's not his kid?

Now complete the following example-
input: So this is something I've kind of struggled with for a few years. To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.

I've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.

Until this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. 

The drive home is where my memory cuts out. 

Next thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.

Honestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. 

Anyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: AITA for getting my feelings hurt for something my sick MIL is (or isn’t) doing? 

Some backstory: My BF and I have been living at my MILs house for a couple of months while the house we bought together is being renovated. About a month ago, she was having trouble breathing and went to the hospital. While at the hospital, we visited her and got her anything she needed. One day she said she wanted us to bring her pills that were by her bed to help her sleep. We bring the pills. 

Just to be sure she can take them, we checked with the doctor to make sure these pills won’t interfere with anything she’s already getting.  She was furious. Tried to rip the pills out of my boyfriends hand. Starts yelling and saying all kinds of hurtful things about my boyfriend (that she knows will bother him), that we don’t love her, and when I try to say something she tells me to leave her family alone. We end up leaving the hospital with her yelling even though the doctor told her she was approved to get the same pills but it has to given to her by the hospital. 

Fast forward to when she comes home: She keeps her distance from us. We keep our distance because there was no apology or thank you after we cleaned the whole house from top to bottom so she can come home to a clean, sterile environment.  She’s still not fully recovered or back to her old self and after a while, my boyfriend puts their differences aside and tries to be there for her. I talk to her here and there. 

One thing he’s always done and expected from me as well is kissing his mom on the cheek before we leave the house and when we come back home. I used to do it before but stopped after the whole situation. Since she’s still not back to normal, I try to start doing it again but when I kiss her on the cheek now I get the cold shoulder. She turns her head away from me and doesn’t kiss me back. You ever tried to kiss or hug someone and they obviously didn’t want it? That feeling. 

When my BF does it she kisses him back. It hurts my feelings when my kiss is obviously not wanted and so I stop doing it. It ruins my mood and my boyfriend is upset that I don’t do it anymore, that she’s sick and I should put my feelings aside. Am I the asshole?

input: My GF and I have been dating for almost a year. As of late, I really noticed that she costs a lot. I mean she goes to Starbucks every single day, eats out atleast one meal a day, etc.
Lately I’ve been blessed and have made ~$5000 this month. This information, I chose to share with GF. 
Since some time has passed, my GF has been wanting to go out and eat and do things, without realizing that I myself have things to pay for. So this lead to her wanting to go to a restaurant last night and I said I wanted to save some money before going out again.
I’ve spent $200 in the past 3 days and she has spent $30.

Whenever I say no to her she’ll say something like “u don’t hesitate to spend money and go get food with ur friends but when it comes to me you say no”... I’ve gone from feeling 100% validated, to talking to her and feeling 100% in the wrong. AITA here?

Now complete the following example-
input: So I want to start this by saying that I’m not the sort of person that does favours expecting favours, I’ll never accept any form of payment from my friends for doing them favours e.g. I used to take / pick up my friends from the city centre which would take about 60-90 minutes and cost around £3-5, I’ve seen my friends pay others £10 at minimum to get picked up by others (taxis are around £25) and I’ve never really wanted to be that guy (not that there’s anything wrong with being that guy, it’s fair to be compensated for your time &amp; cost) however these friends have been my friends since we were 12/13 &amp; others from when we were kids. 

I’ve noticed a lot of annoying behaviour from my friends such as I’ll do so much for them and help them get through daily life from things like taking them to do their food shopping, dropping or picking them up from various places and also lending them money without any interest, not a single penny.

These friends don’t pay me back on time, blow whatever money they do get or just flat out lie and that’s annoying, I wouldn’t mind if they just told me flat out “Hey man, I’m sorry I don’t have the money can I pay you another time?” Over the whole lying thing as lying really pisses me off.

Along with that the other day I was stuck in city centre as there were no trains in to where I live however I let my friends know this about 6/7 hours in advance and I got told by them that they’ll come get me and they were going out near the city centre so it wasn’t an issue for them. The time comes and they’re no where to be seen and they’re excuse was they were eating (they started queuing for a restaurant 30minute before I was going to get off the train), 45 minutes later they hadn’t even bothered to text or ring so I spent literally my last bits of money getting a taxi home. Along with this we never really go out to wherever I suggest it’s never an option and always just thrown aside &amp; I’ve got another friend who we constantly wait for because he’s constantly late and will make you wait outside his house for 10-15 minutes average before coming out of his house. 

I’ve got another set off friends who I hang around with here and there so they sell me out whenever but I’m not too frustrated at that as they’re not my main friendship circle.

All of these little things building up constantly have just left me to exhausted mentally, I can’t find it within me to really get out much and just prefer hanging out on my own and going on drives, I’ve got somewhat of a plan to further my own personal development starting 2019 too so yeah any advice would be great

Sorry for the long read! 

P.S there are a few other annoying things I’ve left out because this has gotten too long

Tl;dr - my friends never treat me how I treat them and I feel very much left out / unimportant, AITA for expecting them to treat me the same way?

Now complete the following example-
input: I’ve been with my girlfriend Lisa for 2 years. Overall she’s a good girlfriend but she’s a little controlling and really insecure. 

I have this friend Anna who I’ve known since high school who is a total smokeshow. We used to hookup but we stopped about 3 years ago. Lisa HATES Anna. She thinks that Anna acts inappropriately toward me and she’s not totally wrong but I think it’s unfair of Lisa to try to control my friendships. Anyway Lisa doesn’t know that Anna and I used to hookup so she shouldn’t have any reason to feel insecure. 

A few months ago Anna started sending me nudes over Snapchat. The first time she did it she said that she was drunk and meant to send it to someone else but I told her that I liked the picture so she started sending them to me more often. 

When she sends the nudes, I tell her that she looks sexy and sometimes I tell her what I wish I could do to her but I’ve ALWAYS made it clear that we can’t hook up because I have a girlfriend. I’ve also never sent her nudes back. 

I know Lisa wouldn’t be happy about this but it’s basically the same as porn so i didn’t think it was that bad. I haven’t hooked up with Anna since Lisa and I got together so I’m still being faithful. 

Anyway somehow Lisa found out that I’ve been sexting Anna and wants to break up with me. Idk how she found out because she won’t tell me. She says I cheated even though I explained to her that I haven’t actually done anything with Anna. 

Lisa never told me that she thought sexting was cheating or that I wasn’t allowed to do it so I think she’s being unfair by not giving me a second chance.

I know I’m not totally in the right here but I think Lisa is more wrong because she’s mad at me for something that we never decided was against the rules.  

TLDR:  Girlfriend wants to break up because I sexted a friend but I didn’t think sexting was cheating. AITA?

input: (Obligatory apology for posting on mobile) 
Ok, for context, this is not just a normal teacher. I go to a highschool where you have a ""major"" and you take some classes pertaining to that major . All of these classes are taught by the major teacher. So I've had this teacher for 2 classes last semester and 2 this semester. All that to say that I see this teacher a lot. This teacher is supposed to be your mentor.
Recently, we had a certain state competition for an event in which she was the teacher organizer. The competition went fine, or so I thought. When I came in to class today, I realized that I have my scoresheets from the judges. So I asked her to see them and she refused.
When I asked why I couldn't see them, she said that she needed to go over them with me. This teacher then proceedes to pull me in her office (in the middle of class) and ""go over them with me"". That consisted of her pointing out every point I got off and how bad I must have done to get that score (she was not there to see me perform). I asked her multiple times throughout this ""interaction"" to have a moment by myself with the scoresheets.
This was my first time seeing the scoresheets. I was extremely upset about how the judges scored me. The hardwork I put in was not enough to do well. And while I was feeling this, she proceeded to nit pick through the comments on the sheet. 
She reached a particular comment on one of the sheets that said ""[I] seemed angry"" and this teacher digs hard into that comment saying things like ""what went on in that room? You're representing this school and me, how could you seem angry!?"" When in the performance (it was a speech) I thought I was passionate. 
I snapped and told her something like, ""you don't know what it was like. You (the teacher) didn't give a shit about my speech until the day of the competition"" and then stormed out of the office and went to my next block. 
Am I the asshole?

Because of this she ended up suffering alot of injuries including her right arm ""dying"" and becoming unusable. Because of this she can't live on her own, can barely go to the bathroom on her own and has 2-3 doctor's appointments every week with a variety of different doctors.

I work 60 hour weeks and my wife is left to take care of two kids and her mother on a daily basis. Through the past two months or so my wife confessed to me that she doesn't believe she can keep up with her chronic pain acting up and her depression flaring up greatly. She feels exhausted every day and feels she cannot even put any effort into our relationship because of this.

I made the comment and she agreed to set up her mother with SSI because she is physically and mentally disabled now. Then once she gets SSI to get her set up with Medicaid so she can get assisted living and move out and have a nurse come in to her place and help take care of her.

Since bringing this up the Mother In Law claims we are being assholes and we don't love her anymore. That we are just abandoning her and trying to get rid of her so we don't have to deal with her anymore.

Now complete the following example-
input: This woman (TW for The Woman from here on out) I’m kind of familiar with had 5 cats. She posted about how she was going to have to “get rid” of one because he was terrorizing the other cats, trying to play and taking it too far. I thought he was adorable, so after a couple days I messaged her, asking about the cat. TW told me nobody had wanted him, and if she couldn’t find anyone to take him she was going to take him out to a back road and dump him. So of course I took the cat. 

Fast forward to now, almost a month later. His name is Stub and he’s an adorable,  affectionate, pain in my ass. I ended up getting a kitten for him to play with, and they get along great. :) The other day, I got a random text from TW, asking me if she could have the cat *back* because apparently, her seven year old son couldn’t accept that he’d “run away” as she’d told him, and was inconsolable about it. She claimed he was still leaving cat food out and calling the cats name in the backyard at night, and just really laid it on thick. I haven’t responded yet. I want to figure out the best way to tell her I’m not giving the cat back, no matter how much her kid cries. AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: So my roommate likes to leave things on top of the shared fridge, like pasta, bread, and snacks. We have a fridge where the freezer is on top. She left for the weekend and was in a rush and apparently just shoved all her shit on top of the fridge/freezer. She must have left some stuff on the top of the closed door of the freezer. I woke up the morning after at like 5 am to get ready for school and opened the freezer, and her container of spaghetti came falling down along with her bread and bagels. Her container is [this one](https://www.amazon.com/OXO-Good-Grips-POP-Container/dp/B000UHT0MM/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1MBTC3M17YD25&amp;keywords=tall%2Boxo%2Bcontainers&amp;qid=1548183589&amp;sprefix=tall%2Boxo%2B%2Caps%2C290&amp;sr=8-2&amp;th=1) . It broke on the bottom, just a small hole on the corner, still usable lid and stuff just a busted bottom portion.

I texted her after I did it letting her know that I broke it and she said it was fine. Today, about a week after it broke, she comes in my room and asks for money to replace the container. I was confused because she didn't seem too irritated by it before but she said the containers are expensive (they are, who the fuck pays $15 for a plastic bin and lid?) so I should pay her back.

I said I don't think I should have to pay for it because she left the container in a precarious location and I didn't do anything wrong to have caused it to be broken. She said I should have checked the top of the freezer before opening it, but that's kind of ridiculous to think to do at 5 am and also I'm 5'2"" so I can't really see the top of the freezer anyway. I also said she could just tape the hole closed on the container and it would still be usable. So now she's off in a huff and called me a cheapskate. Honestly I'll give her the cash if I'm the asshole here but I legit think no one is really in the wrong here, so I shouldn't have to pay.

AITA? 

Tl;Dr: Roommate left her $15 pasta container on top of the freezer and it fell when I opened it. I don't think I should have to pay because she is the one who left it in a dangerous spot and the container is still usable with mild repair. AITA?

I've since then have asked her multiple times to not look at my phone, which she didn't listen to and looked anyway.

input: So me and my sister were at a holiday resort and there were 2 elephants in an enclosure. 
It was late at night and I saw that the elephants were swaying their trunks and sort of “dancing”. I quickly recognized that they were probably hungry and this was their ‘day job’ to entertain guests at the resort. 

It seemed like they were dancing for us to beg for food; it seemed like they were hungry to me. I had no elephant food on me but I saw that their keeper had left some elephant food (sugar cane) nearby, and no one else was around. My sister was telling me not to feed them because “they’ll just end up hungrier tomorrow night when we’re gone”. 

However I fed the elephants anyway and they gobbled up the sugar cane. We kept arguing about it the entire time back to our rooms. 

So AITA for giving those elephants food without permission?

Now complete the following example-
input: Throwaway account for obvious reasons, and a heads up that the situation is a little weird.

Long story short, I’m living with two women I’ve known my whole life, they’re married, and I’m dating both of them. Everyone knows, there’s no secrets, no cheating, none of that. 

But before we became a triangle, they would basically have weekly date nights where they’d go to the movies. They’d see literally everything. I see less movies these days, mostly because I feel like I’m turning into a bit of a snob, or maybe I’m just less willing to put my money into movies I just know I’m not into.

The exception is animated movies. I see basically all of them, and even if I know they’re bad (less than 30 on Rotten Tomatoes bad), I might see it if I’m bored and they aren’t interested.

How to Train Your Dragon just came out, and I’ve been on a new work schedule for a few months now. I work seven days, 12 hour shifts, then I’m off seven days. Naturally it makes seeing movies that come out on the week I work difficult, so there’s a bit of a wait on some of them. I told them they could see HOTYD without me, then a few hours later after really giving it some thought, I said I’d rather they wait. It’d only be a 4-5 day wait, but they went and saw it.

Of course we can always see it again since they liked it enough that they’d be willing to, but for whatever reason I’ve always preferred to see movies I know I want to see with them for the first time for all of us. It’s caused issues in the past, and they know I’m upset about it now, and one of them told me ‘You always get angry about this kind of thing, and we feel like we’re not allowed to see a movie without your permission.’

I know I’m at least partially the asshole, at least because I attempted to rescind the permission to see the movie but if they know it bothers me because this has happened before shouldn’t they be able to  see that maybe if they’re doing something that upsets me that maybe they should stop doing it? I’m not trying to control the movies they see, but for the movies all of us want to see that they know are a must see for me, is it too much of me to ask them to wait a few days?

input: My sister has a 7 year old chihuahua that pees and poops everywhere. Ive tried talking to her, asking her to take him out more or keep him in her room. All this has sparked was an attitude from her, and she does nothing to change it. 
He pees everywhere in the house. The walls. Shits and pees on the couch. The carpet. Theres literaly not a DAY that doesnt pass by where this isnt pee (im really not joking. There can be up to three puddles a day and they completely ignore it expecting someone else to clean it up)

&amp; its not like they dont have time to clean it up or take him out? She goes outside on the porch to smoke 5x+ a day but she still doesnt let him out, even if hes whining at the door.

Ive witnessed her blame it on MY dog (medium sized shiba inh, LARGER poop than a chihuahua &amp; i walk him DAILY. even if he does go i pick it up as soon as i see it), Ive seen her just leave it there for MONTHS (literal MONTHS. not exaggerating). She had a teenage daughter that could let it out in the morning and afternoon but she doesnt. I feel bad for the dog because its just decoration to them at this point. 

Obviously, I already know some people are gonna recommend i take him out myself. I just wanna say that im absolutely NOT going to do this. Its their dog, Its not my responsibilty? Why get a dog if you arent gonna take care of it?  I feel like if i take care of him for them it just reinforces the behavior that they dont have to take care of him at all. Thsy have no care for the fact everything smells like shit and piss and dont care about cleaning it up AT ALL. Theres literally a puddle of pee on a suitcase near the couch thats been there for a week. Im sick of cleaning up after them. 

Hes not registered under a vet. Has has no shots. Eats out of my pets dog bowl.

Now complete the following example-
input: Going to try writing my first post as objectively as possible.Please bear with me.

Some back story: My brother is in his last year of University and has vehemently wanted to own a car for reasons that are pretty legit but I may not agree with. Some of the bigger reasons are how public transports are wasting his time(takes about an hour-ish), he can drive grab (a taxi service) to earn and pay for the car as well. Why I don't agree is because I've always felt that having a car is a luxury and where I'm from, public transport is convenient and ALOT cheaper compared to owning a car so it really is a debt to have before you even start a real job. And lots of working adults at my age can't even afford one. So letting him know my stance and advise was against his, i still trusted him enough to loan him money for a second hand car. (he wanted a first hand car initially) 

Also.. a very crucial point in this AITA post. I've always felt like my mum dotes on him more than me. If i hadn't stepped in to loan him the money, she would have ""loaned"" him the money a 100% and she would not have expected him to pay her back. At the same time she would always be seeking help from me for her financial issue that she never fully shows me full disclosure about. 

I don't have anything to gain by loaning my brother the money except the satisfaction of knowing he has to pay the money which in itself is a lesson worth learning isn't it? And also helping my mum to ease whatever financial issue that she seems to have or not have? or i guess some people just likes to scream poor. 

He has failed to pay me twice and i've told him that 3rd strike he's out cause he clearly can't afford a car. 

And today I happened to see a text from him on my mum's phone asking her to transfer money to him so he could pay me. I felt betrayed and upset that they were doing this behind my back. ( I already found out that she pays gas for him without letting me know).

So i confronted him with that text and told him i was disappointed in him and i could not longer loan him the money.

He replied me that exams were around the corner, he had some taxes to pay and there were big holidays during the month so he couldn't earn enough for the month's payment. And he apologized for not telling me because he was afraid I would be angry. ):

&amp;#x200B;

I was upset about the betrayal by both but hearing his apology made me wonder AITA if i were to stop loaning him the money?

input: So, it all started last summer when I asked out this girl, A, and got rejected: no big deal. However, from there we started texting and meeting up, and became good friends, completely platonically. (all of my friends know this)

This year I discovered that me and a girl, B, both have feelings for each other, which was cool. A few days ago however, A asked if I wanted to meet up on Thursday (not as a valentine, it's just we were both free that day.)

Today, I mentioned in passing to a ""friend"", C, my plans for Thursday, (Keep in mind that I had had no contact with B, and had definitely not been asked to do anything on valentines by her,) and was told that I was being stupid by C, and that B would be angry. I took it with a pinch of salt, as he is one of B's close friends, and want us to get together, but not before asking him not to tell her, to which he promised. I pretty much ignored it until a few hours later, when mutual friends all begin to chime in, supporting C. I asked C how they knew, and he told me that he had ""accidentally"" told them. (I later discovered that he had immediately pulled B aside and told her upon seeing her, and had gone on to tell others in the group.) Just now however, he sent me a screenshot of a conversation he'd had with B, where she mentioned that she'd be ""fuming"" if she had found out any later, or from someone else. In my opinion, she, and C, had no right to be upset at all, and my meeting A will have no bearing on any interactions that I might have with B in the future, yet judging by my friends reactions, I feel like I'm missing something. So, AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input:  

Throwaway here because people know my regular account. 

I’m getting married in June. I’m going to have my friend Jim as my dude of honor, and my friend Jane as my bridesmaid. 

Jim and I have been friends since college, but my friendship with Jane is longer and a bit more complicated.

We started to be friends in high school where we were friends with two other girls (they’ll be important later). Typical teenager and 20 something drama happened, and I’m not close with the two other girls anymore. One straight up said she didn’t want to be friends with me anymore, and I guess the other friend just followed her lead. I’ll admit that Jane and I used to be closer when we were younger, and we drifted apart but I still considered her a close friend.

When I got engaged I asked Jane to be my bridesmaid. When I asked she was kind of hesitant. She was engaged too and said we’d probably be planning weddings at the same time and she was worried she wouldn’t be able to devote a lot of time to my wedding. I told her it was going to be super laidback and she wouldn’t have to do much and that I wanted her there, so she agreed. 

Planning the wedding has had its own ups and downs (lots of drama from family), but Jane has been a good enough bridesmaid. My friend Jim has been planning my bachelorette, and they both went to see me get my veil. I think she could stand to be a bit more involved, but considering distance and time she’s doing enough. 

When Jane first got engaged, she wasn’t even sure if wanted to have a traditional wedding. She was talking about doing something really small and only inviting immediate family and close friends. It turns out that she actually is going to have a ceremony and reception in the fall. 

I awkwardly found out over dinner after pushing her for wedding details that she was planning on having bridesmaids, and I wasn’t one of them. She claimed it was because I live far away (not really, we live on different cities on the east coast and are about a train ride away) and she didn’t want to bother me because I’d be busy with my wedding and marriage. 

To make matters worse, the two girls I had a falling out with are of course in the wedding. 

It hurts so much since I assumed we’d all be together during our weddings. I’m hurt. Jane and I went through a lot together and I really wanted her to be a part of my wedding. I’m hurt that she doesn’t feel the same way. 

When I told my mom she was shocked and said how rude Jane was. My fiancé said it was okay to feel hurt and that it was a dick move, but that Jane also has a right to have whoever she wants in her wedding party.

Am I wrong for feeling like this? Should I confront her? I don’t even know if I want her in my wedding anymore.

Now complete the following example-
input: My first post and I'm on a mobile so apologies if the formatting is wrong.

So I'll start off by saying that I have never and would never cheat on my boyfriend, so in a way this whole thing is pointlessly hypothetical, but it's still been bothering me. We've been together for over a year and are both in our early twenties. He's always had trust issues, mainly due to low self-esteem which wasn't helped when his last (long term) girlfriend left him for someone else.

So basically the other day he told me that if I cheated on him he'd revenge-cheat on me. He's mentioned this before but it was a lot earlier in our relationship so I kinda figured the more he grew to care about me the less this would be an issue. Apparently not. I'm hurt that he's the kind of person who would want to hurt me, even if I hurt him. If he cheated on me, I'd be distraught, but I'd never do anything to hurt him because I love him. I kinda feel it should be the same for him. I'm also hurt that he even considers the possibility that I'd cheat on him, because I never would.

Just a bit of background regarding our relationship, I'm not sure how relevant it is. When I first started going out with him I was already in love with someone else, unreciprocated, and I'd never made any attempt to be with this person either before or during my relationship with my boyfriend, so it was merely an internal struggle of mine. He found out about this and was extremely hurt that I hadn't told him about this when we first got together. We hadn't even said the L word to each other at this point. This, I think, has made him trust me less than he otherwise would.

  BUT am I the asshole for not wanting to leave my wife despite me not really being happy? Getting a divorce would absolutely destroy my life (I'd more than likely loose my kids because of the nature of my job/ We'd all be financially fucked)
 We both know that our marriage is not great, we recognize that but usually put it on the back burner because we're so busy. Plus, due to her upbringing she's not  really supportive of the idea of divorce. 
  But We argue constantly, nothing dramatic just consistent. We've both kind of let ourselves go and I find myself looking elsewhere. I'm sure she does to. 
  I understand that having kids exposed to this type of relationship isn't ideal however I took this job and moved our family to a different part of the country to a much worse environment in the first place; us getting a divorce would only lead to her taking them back.
 I also understand that being in a marriage with someone and not being happy with it isn't a good situation for either of us but sacrificing my kids well being and stability for some abstract idea of 'happiness' seems like a terrible idea.

input: If there needs to be any clarification, please ask in the comments. 

So, yesterday, I F(17) went on a dinner date with a boy (M17) will call Gary for the sake of anonymity. He was really sweet and just seemed like a genuinely good kid and was very respectful. Thing is, I agreed to go on the date to give him a chance, I think that’s kinda the point of a first date. Regardless, I just don’t find Gary physically attractive. I just seen him more as a friend than someone I’d be interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with. He asked me on a second date afterwards, and I told him I wasn’t sure and I would definitely get back to him with my decision within a couple days.

Here’s the predicament: Prom is this Saturday and I don’t have a date. That, on it’s own, doesn’t matter, because I’m perfectly content with going with friends and without a date. However, Gary does online school, and thus will never have a prom to go to. I would love to invite him to be my date, but I don’t want to look (or feel) like I’m using him. He seemed down when he mentioned he would never have a prom, and part of me feels like it would be fun for both of us. BUT, I’m 90% sure I do not want to pursue a romantic relationship with him. 

Would I be the asshole if I invited Gary to Prom with me, even though I don’t have intention of dating him?

We took his keys and all that and we thought everything was good. Well about 3 weeks ago I found a juul pod in a pair of shorts. I haven’t seen him wear these shorts in a long time and they were stuffed under his bed so I figured it may have been from when he got caught before. Just to be safe I bought a nicotine urine test and tested one morning when he forgot to flush and he tested positive. We had a talk and he ended up lying at first then told the truth once I told him I tested him. I took his PS4 from his sisters and I’ve never seen him this mad. He keeps insisting that I couldn’t take it because he paid for it and it wasn’t in our house, etc... I told him to get it back he needed a job and needed to pass a nicotine test. It’s been a week and he has a job but hasn’t passed the test. He destroyed the juul and gave it to me but I’m waiting for the nicotine test to test negative. It seems that we just argue every day and it gets worse. He’s never been mad for this long. AITA?

input: I live with two roommates. Because of my schedule and training, I often eat at unusual times and thus cook for myself (I would ask them if they want some as well, but I know the answer from experience). Recently they and another common friend got mad about it saying I was being wasteful and egoistic. The thing is, I pay for 90% of the food because I don't want to eat the crap they would buy (canned vegetables/packaged meat) and I want to eat in a way that doesn't affect my training and schedule negatively (no food 2h before training and eating within 1 hour after training). I know one of them is quite the environmentalist, but I really don't care about his politics when it comes to my personal life. Besides, we'd just cook more together, essentially using the same amount of resources except for the electricity for the stove. AITA for living my own life?

input: Throwaway.

I met a girl at an event I was helping out with, and we had a pretty good conversation (surprising for me, since I'm normally an awkward gal.) It was all going so well and I thought I'd made a new friend, but then not even an hour into the conversation she asks me if I'd like to join a 'motivational course'. I'm like oh cool, that sounds good and then she tells me it costs about £1,000.

Like, dude. How can you try and sell a £1000 program on someone you've literally just met? I felt like I've been MLM-ed. Not only that, I'm a student, so I don't have that kind of money around. I jokingly say this and she goes 'oh it's cool, you can pay in instalments over a year.' So great, I get to go into debt?

Now, to be fair, she seemed like she was genuinely pushing a motivational course (for those who think it might be some sort of MLM thing) because she could give quite a lot of details on the course (unfortunately I've forgotten the name) and what they have to do on it and how its structured. She also seemed genuinely passionate about it. But it just really soured everything for me- I thought that either there's some kind of benefits for her to recruit others, or else this is some kind of culty thing that they're recruiting for. So later, I deleted my number off her phone when she wasn't looking, because she said she was going to contact me 'so we could go together'. AITA? I feel a bit like one, because it was her phone and I did willingly give the number, and I felt like I should have been a lot more upfront about not wanting to join the program instead of just going 'mm-hmm, interesting.'

Now complete the following example-
input: No matter how this ends, it's gonna be awkward because one of the friends is my college roommate. Also, this is my first post so here goes. I've been annoyed by how often my roommate rants about even the most slightly controversial things (she's always been doing this somewhat regularly but it's been daily since last week). For example, last night, my friends and I were watching a movie and there was a scene where a woman takes off her bra but her breasts weren't on-screen (the movie was rated PG-13) and she whined for a solid 5 minutes about how sexualized breasts are and that they should be revered as ""life-giving and sacred,"" then ended it with how bras are ""designed by men to oppose women/women should 'free their nipples.'"" She does this with other things she sees and reads about, and although she's entitled to her own opinion, I hate how out-of-the-blue and constant it is. Every time I try to counter her with an opposing opinion or become visibly irritated, everyone calls me rude. I just think they're overreacting. The fact that I'm never taken seriously since I don't talk and act like they do has bothered me since day one, but I kept my mouth shut about it since they're--apparently--good people. 
It doesn't end here though because what really set me off was another one of my friends saying that everyone in Wisconsin is racist--and they all know that I was born and raised in Wisconsin. I then explained that from personal experience, that's not true, but they ignored me anyway. Overall, they claim to be accepting but treat me like I'm from another planet and aren't afraid to personally offend me when I'm right in front of them. I've been considering drifting away from them and making some other friends instead, yet I'm afraid to at the same time since I need to pick my roommate for sophomore year next month. Am I as inconsiderate as they say I am, or am I just a bad friend?

input: So to make a long story short a friend and I got into a new friend group consisting of about 6 people. Almost instantly i hit it of with 2 of the women in the group and i started to hang out with them alone and not only within the group of friends. Ive even developed a huge crush on one of them that i let my original friend know about.

Almost a couple weeks after telling him my friend started to act differently. He inserted himself into conversations i was having with these two girls, started to speak to them alot more which i was conpletely fine with. Then his behavior changed even more. He became very white-knighty trying to do everything their way and really just trying to get their attention. It was nice in the begining but its developed into a huge annoyance when he goes out of his way to please them or to be liked by them. This personality he puts on in front of them isnt his real self, its completely fake and its really difficult for me to see him act fake in front of our mutual friends, or to try that hard to be likeable and not the person he is in reality (which is the guy ive been friends with and know since we were 4.)

Recently ive thought about confronting him about the situation and explaining what i feel is happening but i dont know if im just jealous because of one of the two girls or if everything is as i make it out to be. AITA?

But I'm not sure if we'll go that frequently tbh. We live kinda far and rarely do much on the weekends. It seemed too pricey to spend on something I may not use with my current financial situation. I explained this and he understood. Then my friend suggested seeing Wicked next weekend. I was so excited as I've always wanted to see it. It costs around the same amount and I told my bf I was thinking about going. He got upset because he thought I was too broke to get the passes for Knotts. He said ""you didn't have the money to go to Knotts but suddenly you have the money when it's something YOU want."" I didn't know what to say. I didn't ask him to go as I know he doesn't like musicals and I'm okay with going with just my friends. I haven't confirmed that I want to go yet.

input: My girlfriend (long distance) and I have been dating for 6 months now and talking over over a year. She doesn't live in the states and doesn't have daylight savings so she doesn't fully understand it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I wakeup at 8AM and we call and chat for about 2 hours almost everyday. Well yesterday I had my alarm set for 8AM as usual and wakeup to call my girlfriend who is angry at me because I ""woke up late"". Now mind you my phones clock adjusts automatically and I had no idea that today was daylight savings day. Nothing alerted me at all.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as I realized I told her that it must have been daylight savings and I had no idea, my clock adjusts on its own and that it was an accident. She is claiming things like ""how could you not know? did you not feel like you slept too long?"". Well the answer is no, I don't know if that's a normal thing or not? Are people able to tell if they over slept an hour? I sure can't...infact I have sleep apnea and feel like nomatter how long I sleep, I never get enough..which she knows this but thinks I use it as an excuse and over-exaggerate it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm not trying to paint a bad picture of my girlfriend...there are times I've woken up late or fallen asleep after waking up on accident..I totally get it annoys her even if its not done on purpose..so for this to happen again I get that she's angry about it..but I had no idea it was daylight savings!! I tried explaining but she just says I'm ""trying to reason out""!

&amp;#x200B;

I told her I couldn't argue about this tonight (since she wouldnt call me today and we didn't talk since) and that I wouldn't want to entertain the argument when I already stated it was an accident and I didn't do it on purpose. I just told her goodnight because she thinks I'm being an ass for calling her out and thinking shes being ridiculous..so I just muted my phone now and will be listening to what you guys think.

&amp;#x200B;

Now complete the following example-
input: My sister wants to get a second dog. My sister and I both still live with my mom, she's turning 20 soon and I'm 18. We have a few pets, namely a cat, dog and a few fish. The cat and dog are just kinda ""the family's"" but the fish are bought and kept by my sister.

&amp;#x200B;

You have to understand where I am coming from. I love dogs and cats, but my dog is the light of my life. The one we currently have is called Marvin, and we've had him for six years. This dog is everything to me. I'm a huge introvert and due to having to move a lot of times throughout my childhood, hopping between schools and such I haven't got many friends. Most of my friends I only see online, and the only times I go outside are to go to the store and to walk my dog. So this dog has helped me through some rough times.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday my sister and my mom were both downstairs. I went downstairs to grab a drink when my mom says something about how my sister was in a predicament. My mom wanted to hear what I had to say, but my sister seemed less eager to hear my thoughts. My mom told me that my sister was gonna get a second dog with her own money, and if I thought the dog looked cute. Now, I was kind of tired and generally speaking not thinking too hard so I simply shrugged and said ""yeah it's pretty cool"" and kept walking.

&amp;#x200B;

It's only when I got back to my room and sat down that I actually thought about it. And then it hit me, I really don't think this is cool at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, we live in a duplex apartment. We aren't poor, we could probably sustain two dogs although it would cut things kind of tight. As for myself... I just can't. I hate the idea of another dog in the house. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's mostly just the fact that I'll have to get to like this second dog, and I know I won't. My first dog, it clicked instantly. But a second dog? I just don't have room for that. And since I spend most of the day at home, and walk the dog most of the time, I just feel like I can't get myself to care. No matter how hard I try. 

&amp;#x200B;

Worst case scenario: The two dogs hate each other. In which case we just brought an actual invader into our home. If the new dog is a piece of shit then I will probably grow to hate it, as I love my current dog too much. If the dog is actually nice and friendly, the two will become inseparable. This will basically mean that by default if I wanna spend more time with our current dog I better start liking this new dog too. Then there's also the fact that I doubt my sister can care for the dog properly. She barely cleans the fishtank enough times, let alone something as fragile as a dog in an apartment. Our cat won't like it either, and just in general the time and effort it'll take to get used to this new dog will just be too much. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I told my sister I hated the idea of getting another dog in the house, we had a debate about it. She ended up calling me selfish and saying that I'm not the only one living in this house. She told me she had been planning this since 2018, and wasn't gonna give up on it now. This was my boiling point, and I didn't really wanna have a massive fight with my own family so I just gave up and continued with my day. The reason why this comment pissed me off so much is cause of how inconsiderate it feels. She's the one who wants to bring a new dog. She's the one who's forcing everyone else in the house to adapt. And she never decided to tell me anything about it. All just because she wants another dog.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know why she wants another dog so badly, and I'm not about to ask as it'll probably lead nowhere. I really just don't know, am I being selfish? I hope this whole situation fits here.

Now complete the following example-
input: To begin, he doesn't actually ask my permission to have guests over or even warn me or the other tenant. I signed the lease with him and my best friend of 6 years (31M) 1/1/2019. Since then we have lived 5 full weeks with his girlfriend and his male friend who do not pay rent (aren't on the lease) or help around the house. Me and the other tenant want to talk to him but don't know how to approach it since his guests are still around.

&amp;#x200B;

A little context, we are not perfect roommates either. He has complained to me about dishes not being done. Totally understandable! No problem! and we have immediately cleaned them if he is cooking and often times its just a dish or two my friend or I have overlooked but still should not be an on going thing. During this cleaning session he passive aggressively told us that if he complains to management about us 3 times we will be kicked out even though we pay $2,600 a month and he pays $1,200. My fear is bringing up this issue to him and having our living space become uncomfortable. So far we have not used the kitchen in 6 weeks out of fear of his complaints.

&amp;#x200B;

Along with this he throws parties. Loud weekday parties. I work at 7 am and have to wake up at 5 am every day on the weekdays. I get the sense that he is lonely. I want him to feel free to do as he pleases but I am quiet and have to go to bed at 7-8 pm (i have a hard time sleeping a full 8 hours). I told him this before signing the lease with him and he told us this wasn't an issue because he worked ""nights"". This turned out to be untrue. Since then he has taken vacation from work for some reason, gotten hair plugs and stays home all day complaining to us about how loud we shut our doors because his ears are sensitive to sound due to the hair plug procedure.

&amp;#x200B;

I do NOT want to get a lawyer or do something crazy or hostile until I can figure out how to approach this. I just want to have a discussion about it with him. In fact, if I haven't already expressed it the other tenant isn't okay with it either and has had multiple discussions with me about his girlfriend blocking the driveway, basically living with us with out paying any rent and finding random strangers just walking about. I'd like to note that he makes close to 100k which is much more than what I or my friend/other tenant make separately. We pay rent each month on time and have no issue paying but the reason I mention this is because we know he doesn't need financial support from his friends/gf to split his portion of the rent. He just likes having guests over. My theory is its a cultural thing, he is Indian and moved to America about 8 years ago. idk? 

What should I do? AITA

Should I be okay with this?

Now complete the following example-
input: I like to think I'm right on this one, but posting to make sure I'm not missing anything. My son is 13, and his middle school is currently in off-season after their first year of football. He doesn't plan to join the team next year, because he's not as good as others, but he still loves to play along with other sports with friends. For the longest time, the wife and I didn't really give it much attention. Growing up, I played the same way, and the worst I came out with were a couple of fingers dislocating and a sprained knee. Some friends had it worse, but I guess I never considered my son's health until recently.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that he and his friends play tackle football without any pads or proper equipment every weekend. I got a call this past weekend from my son asking about an emergency. Some of them wear cleats (spiked shoes for better traction), and somehow, one of his friends got stepped on face first by the cleats and was bleeding like no other. He ended up going to the ER and getting stitches, but it certainly made me realize that playing tackle football without any protection can lead to far worse things. I know there's been a lot of discussion about concussions and I feel like that is only more expected if you're not wearing helmets.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, I told my son he can't play tackle football anymore. I'm fine if he and his friends want to play flag football, but my son started giving a huge fit. Got into an argument, told me he hates me, says how its unfair because I used to play without pads back in the day,how his friends are still planning to play next week,  etc. My son has been radio silent with me and only talking with my wife. My wife is on my side, but she's playing the good cop in this situation so that he is communicating with one of us. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I offered a good alternative to play flag football. It's actually something I still play with some co-workers and it's great. But I just want to know if I made a mistake?

Now complete the following example-
input: My mother remarried when I was 18 after being a single mother for years. I'm 32 now.

Recently my mother decided that my choice of spouse and my spouse's religion did not align with her expectations, so she cut me out of her life last winter.

Fwiw, she's sent a few texts saying she loves me, but also refuses to apologize for her actions. She also thinks I'm being disrespectful for standing up for my partner's freedom to believe what she will. 

The only reason I ever talked to her husband is that I'd go visit every few months. When I was younger he asked me to go hunting with him, but I didn't really enjoy it. 

His mother passed away a few years ago and he asked me to attend the funeral. I did - I even filled in as a pallbearer because one dude had a back injury.  I felt super uncomfortable doing that because I had never met his mother. And now I'm a pallbearer at her  funeral. Apparently he insisted to his brothers that I do it because he saw me as “her grandson.” I didn't want to make a fuss at this poor woman's funeral, so I went along with it.

Now that my mother disowned me, I haven't visited or contacted him. He texted asking if he had done something wrong to make me push him away, and I basically told him what I'm writing here now. He's an okay dude, but we don't really have anything in common.  And with my mother freezing me out, I don't feel like navigating the complicated politics of him, her, and me. Even if we keep our contacts brief and relatively discreet. Ain't got time for that lol.

I felt bad about it, but I've been reflecting on just how much I've bent backwards to accommodate his “son I never had” fantasy. I've no interest in a surrogate father figure, and I've no interest in helping him live out his fatherhood fantasies. He has a daughter - age 36 - that he never really spent time with either and never fully acknowledged.  

Plus, he once tried to extort my mother out of $100,000. He asked for a divorce and said $100,000 would get him to go away quietly. This was years ago an apparently they figured it out. But still, once bitten twice why, right?

So. AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: In my country women greet anyone and everyone with a hug and kiss on the cheek (mostly cheeks touching and making a kiss noise). Men get to shake hands with each other but greet women this way. 

When I was little, this wasn't a problem because kids aren't expected to do so. But when I turned about 14, the time had come when I had to engage in this social practice.

I have never been a touchy person. I hate physical contact even with close family. With close family it does not at all gross me out. It's just a little awkward. But with strangers it absolutely disgusts me. 

I try to not be rude and greet people the traditional way but their faces are faces and therefore often sweaty, smelly, greasy, etc. I guess I don't hide it well often and people just don't get that I don't like it. And some will even get mad at me and complain to my parents if they are present (even though I'm 19) that I am a disrespectful child and whatnot.

I have tried shaking their hand politely as a man would but they ignore this and squeeze me (specially women which makes me accidentally touch their breasts and makes it even grosser). 

AITA for not complying to my own culture? I know I'm rude, but come on! Does any one of you want to press their faces against a stranger's?

input: I am a law abiding citizen, always have been and always will be. However, I do have a friend who has been involved in aspects of organised crime and met up with him about a month ago. 

I am aware that he has been involved in certain criminal activities, processing goods and such. It is not my business and I have never pryed further.  Although, I stay on the side of the law, I have no great regard for the police and no certainly desire to aid them. 

So recently, my friend shows me a picture of the group he hangs out with (they did a paint balling session). One of the faces I recognise, as I have organised deliveries (I am involved with logistics) as being a police officer. 

I tell my friend this, and say that it seems somehow a police officer has got into their group and say nothing more. Maybe, the cop is just a friend and not undercover but I feel my friend should be informed. 

My friend is surprised but thanks me for the information. We leave and won't see each other again till next Spring. 

Since, I am not involved in organised crime or any crime in fact. I see this as just one friend informing another and nothing more.

Now complete the following example-
input: This has been something I constantly ask myself and I’m sure other people have felt the same so hopefully this can be relatable to some people. 

I’ll start with how I know I’m a generous person because I love my friends and family and am always looking for ways to help the people in my life. I constantly want to give to everyone so they can be happy and also I just love gift giving. I don’t really have to buy friendships, so it doesn’t feel like that. It’s more of like when I want to buy drinks for a friend or give a person I care about a small gift or just simple little things. Sometimes though, I tend to draw myself back because I feel like people notice this and want to take advantage of it.

One time in particular, a friend had came in from out of town and gotten his car towed. He expressed how he’d be in so much debt and wouldn’t be able to get it out so I offered to help find other solutions. The easiest and quickest solution was to bail his car out then and there, so I told him not to worry about it right away and just pay me back when he can. It’s been almost 8 months and I don’t think I’m gonna see that $300 ever again.

Another is more recently and slightly different, I’ve let a friend stay at my house for about a half week since they’ve been in a difficult situation. They also don’t have a car so I had to drive them to work for a few days as well. I didn’t mind this and they said they’d pay me back in any way they can (buying me drinks or giving me cigs) which was totally okay with me. But when I asked for those things (for instance, just asking if they could buy me a drink when I see them out) they acted like I would owe THEM for it now.

So in conclusion, should I feel bad for asking for my money back? Should I feel like a dick because, even though I give a lot, people never want to return it? 

I know the simple answer here is stop being nice to people that don’t deserve it. But sometimes it’s more difficult than that. I just want to not feel like I owe people things after all that I’ve given them.

I hope some people can relate to this in some way, and thanks in advance to anyone reading

input: This is probably better in r/parenting but here it is anyhow. My son is 2 and a half, and he likes to arrange his toy cars in a neat row. He gets VERY angry when you move a car out of line, and so I generally try to respect “his” toys and leave them be. 

Anyway, he had a bunch of flash cards (numbers, alphabet, etc) and they were in a big messy pile. I was sorting them out while he was playing in the room with me (with other toys) when he came over to look at what I was doing. I could tell he wanted to mess up my neat piles, so I asked him very politely and seriously not to mess up my piles. He got a mischievous look on his face and then batted all the cards all over the room. I got up, walked over to his cars, and said “I asked you not to mess up my cards, and you did it anyway, so now I’m gonna mess up your cars” and I calmly scattered them all around. He flipped out and started crying, and I explained to him that if he wants people to respect his things, he needs to be nice to other people too.

I was trying to use this as a teaching moment for him, but I honestly just feel bad about the whole thing in hindsight and wonder if I made the right move. In the moment, I felt like it was the most appropriate way of teaching a toddler, since his language and comprehension skills are not completely developed yet. AITA for going the “eye for an eye” route with him?

When a movie we both want to watch hits one of those media sources, I always suggest we watch it together when we have time. I almost always get the same answer from my wife where she does not want to watch it right now. Her reasoning for this is she finds the two hours for most movies is to much of a commitment, but then will watch 3 hours of crap TV.

input: My boyfriend (well just call him M) and I are creators on Instagram (he is also on TikTok). I'm a digital and traditional artist and in one of my classes we create t shirts and things (socks, lanyards, water bottles, stickers, you name it).

Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

input: I really don’t think they are that small but she believes she has super small boobs. I admit, they aren’t big nor medium but I think it’s perfect. I never really liked and implants of any sort, but especially when it came to breasts. 
To me, they look odd and too “perfectly” round. They are just fake balloons and don’t feel anything like a real boob. Plus the scars. 
We were having a discussion a month ago about it and she asked if I would find her just as attractive. I didn’t want to lie to her. I told her I would still love her but I wouldn’t find it a little unsettling. I didn’t want to lie to her and have her get a boob job only to come back not getting the smile she expected from me. 
Most of my friends acted surprised and told me fake “tits” are awesome. I never liked fake boobs but I somehow feel a little bad for telling my girlfriend my opinion.

Now complete the following example-
input: Some back story: my girl had a really rough life until she was 14 and finally came to live with us. I've known her since she was 7 because I lived with her mother and we were both heroin addicts. There's a whole lot of back story so I'm not gonna get into it, but I realised how shitty of a person her mother was and separated myself from her, but I ended up meeting my stepdaughters father about 9 years ago and we've been together almost 7 years. My girl ended up in foster care and cys (children and youth services) never even tried to contact her father and when we finally found out where she was he had to fight for a year to get her. She had a lot of issues at first, the worst of it was the pathological and compulsive lying, but then came the boys. I don't totally blame her, her mother was horrible and slept with anyone she could. Now she's 19 and she has this boyfriend who is abusive, physically and emotionally. She has cheated on him multiple times with multiple different people, so she's not innocent either. The kid isn't allowed here because he has no respect for our rules and she lies to us constantly ""oh brandy is picking me up"" like I don't look out the window and see it's this little asshole. She started college and she met a kid who's a really good guy and she's basically using him for his car, I think she does care about him, but as soon as the good kid leaves, she's getting picked up by ""brandy"". This kid is legitimately crazy, he drives past our house on a regular basis, when he was allowed here he would pinch her/slap her over and over again until she finally defended herself and he would gaslight her into feeling bad that she hurt him back. He would constantly be trying to get in her pants right on our couch and it definitely worked at least once because my husbands blanket was on the couch and I went to get it and there was fucking sperm on it. That's when we decided he's not allowed here anymore. Last week she told me she was getting picked up by ""brandy"" and usually before she leaves she'll tell me she's going and we say our I love  you's but she didn't that day so I went and looked out the window, sure as shit she's getting picked up by that fuck bag, literally an hour after the other kid left. I stewed over this for a couple of days until she said something about getting picked up by a female friend and I said something along the lines of ""oh, does this one have facial hair too?"" And she totally freaked. Saying that she's acting like her mother and no one believes a word that comes out of her mouth was probably a bit much, I do feel bad about it, but we have no idea what to do! We've gone about it every which way we can, including telling her if she's going to continue seeing that asshole, we just don't wanna hear about him or the drama that comes with him. I've asked her repeatedly not to lie to me about who's picking her up, don't say a name or anything, just say ""Hey I'm going out I'll be back later"" it's the lying that pisses me off. I know she has to make her own choices and mistakes, so I don't tell her what to do, just give advice if she asks for it. I'm her mom, she is MY daughter and we love each other. I told her I was sorry for what I said and we've made up. Please someone give me some advice on any aspect of this, even tell me I'm an asshole if that's your opinion. We just don't know what to do.

Now complete the following example-
input: So I have this girl added on Snapchat that lives a couple towns away from me, she was very nice and we talk everyday, we had a 9 day Snapchat streak, because we talked everyday. So I work overnight, and she works in the afternoon so as far as seeing each other goes we barely can, but we both were off yesterday which was Thursday AKA Valentine's day

so this whole week we were talking about meeting up to go get some ramen noodles on Valentine's day, and we agreed for 4 p.m. there was a state of emergency in my state 2 days ago that made it so my dough didn't ship in until 4 am, so I had to stay and bake everything at my job and left at 9 am, when I would usually have to leave at 5 am. you would expect me to be tired and pissed off, but I'm actually happy when I'm leaving work because I have plans to hang out with this girl later.

So I go home and fall asleep, and I wake up to her giving me a snap saying she's sorry that something came up and she's out with her friends right now. She said she can hang later, and I told her oh yeah that's fine let's hang out when you get home. So she gets home around 6 or 7, and she sends me another snap saying that she's busy once again, that's something came up at her house. This honestly ruined my day.

I looked forward to hanging out with this girl for such a long time, just for her to seemingly blow me off. I took a nap and woke up around 11:30 p.m. and realize that she didn't text me to hang out at night. What transpired happens in my previous r/rant post. In the comments of that post you'll find what I sent to her, somebody told me to send her how I truly feel, so I did. I told her that I understand her situation, that I know things come up but we had a plan to hang out and I told her that it ruined my day that we couldn't hang out, because it's not like we can hang out everyday.

She was asleep so I didn't get a text till a couple hours ago. And she was having none of it, she didn't necessarily tell me I was a horrible person, but her whole demeanor changed. I could tell she didn't want to talk to me anymore, she vilified me for no reason. she basically told me that she didn't want to talk to me anymore.

I told her how I felt one more time, how I wish she would just fucking tell me what's going on instead of being so vague, and then I removed her as a friend on Snapchat. I feel like I didn't do anything wrong, however my mind is conflicted, I screen recorded all of our snap conversations, and I will post them for further clarification if need be. I just don't know how.

Am I the asshole?

input: a few things first: he was *awful* to me. i was in a bad spot, and was binge-eating sugar due to stress at the time. he'd forcefully take any sugar i had while ridiculing and making fun of me for it, which would stress me out more. id basically inhale it when i got it back. he'd also take my phone whenever he wanted, threaten to lock me out unless i gave him the password, download incest porn on it, read ALL my (very personal) notes, then read them to me in a mocking voice while holding it away from me, *constantly* teased me..

&amp;#x200B;

i found out i was pregnant after he dumped me. i told him, saying i only wanted him to know, wanted nothing from him, and was only telling him in case she wanted to meet him, so i wouldnt show up at his door with a 5 year old. so far he's: talked about how hard it is on *him,* how *his* friends made fun of him when *he* told them (in response to me talking about how im doing all the work. carrying her, buying everything, going to end up being the main caretaker.. as if those were equal), asked me 30 times about *my* plan as if i was incompetent, without offering up *anything* ***he*** was going to do, threatened to sue me when i explained again i didnt want him around (making me sob and stressing me out in the first trimester, the most common time for miscarriages) only stopped after my parents called him and chewed him out, got arrested, told me he only wanted in her life because he was obligated, asked about details on me and my new (wonderful) partner, stressed me out more, etc..

&amp;#x200B;

he stopped for a bit, (bc prison) but now hes messaging me again. and, again, i explained why i dont want him around. she'll already *have* two wonderful parents, we're not friends/im not comfortable around you, its for *her* health and safety, everyone elses problems always have to be about *you,* the porn, the drinking/smoking/drugs (hes said he'd fix those three, but im not sure), you stress me out, strained relationships between parents can *really* mess with a kid, you threatened to sue me, you dont even *want* her and have done nothing but act like shes ruined your life, (to which he said he sees her as his ""last chance for redemption"" and ""the thing thatll fix him"" .. who puts *that* much pressure on an *unborn infant??* what happens when she DOESNT magically fix him? which, she *wont*) and theres not a *single* reason why you *should* be around. all he could come up with is ""shes ***my*** daughter!"" (which, i dont feel dragging a girl off into the woods to get off on her for 5 minutes entitles you to fatherhood.. dna isnt everything, doesnt make you the father of my child, and youve done *nothing* to be one) and ""are you just being overprotective because its ""close to your time"""", ignoring what i said *completely!*

Now complete the following example-
input: So, I know most of the stories on here are way more serious than this but here’s something to lighten it up I guess. 
So me and my friends have all been enjoying Super Smash Bros Ultimate (like any sane human). However, I’ve found myself becoming resentful towards my friend group. I wouldn’t consider myself an amazing player or anything, but I am definitely better than my friends who play. In a 1v1 scenario, I can usually win with most characters.  This doesn’t mean that they never beat me or anything, but I am just slightly above their skill level. The problem is that when I play with them, they always seem to team up on me. They will occasionally fight each other, but usually the battle goes like this.
1) They shoot projectiles at each other for 30 seconds and get one or two hits.
2) I hop in to try to actually fight them and not just fire off a projectile every five seconds.
3) They both spring into action and hit me up close as much as they can until I rack up damage and die. 
This is basically a rinse and repeat for every battle, every character. I don’t find it fun at all to sit on opposite sides of the stage and shoot at each other hoping you get a hit in for 10 minutes. I feel like they aren’t even playing the game, at least not the way it’s meant to. For this reason, I play with my friends less and less, and it doesn’t seem like they care anyways. This both makes me resentful and it hurts me because I don’t have many friends and I feel rejected by my group. So, AITA for feeing this way?

Now complete the following example-
input:  This was last year, I was 14 at the time and this was the first relationship either of us had.

Background: me and my ex (let's call her ""M"") were in the same class in 8th grade, she was very shy and socially awkward and I was pretty much her only male friend, There were pretty big hints that M had a crush on me, and I also had a crush on her, but eventually forced myself to get over her because I was afraid that if we would end up dating I'd stop liking her (hint: that's EXACTLY what happened).

Half a year went by and M asks me out via a mutual friend, I rejected her because of the reasons I mentioned her and we barely talked for the rest of the year. Fast forward a few months to the start of 9th grade, me and M talk about the rejection and decide we should go back to how it was, it all goes well for a week, cue the AITA.

I eventually develop feelings for M, and after about a day of thinking about it, I ask her out. It all goes well at first, but after 3 weeks or so I start to doubt if I liked her as much and she liked me, I think about it but don't do anything about it yet, a week later and it's our 1 month anniversary, I,  being the unoriginal guy that I am, ask my best friend for an idea for a gift, she tells me to draw a heart but instead of lines, it's all the reasons I love M, I think about it and wake up super early the day before to make the gift, I give it to her and she absolutely loved it, and it all goes well, for about a couple of hours. 

Me and my best friend were talking and the conversation drifted to me and M, and after a couple of minutes I realized that I was correct in doubting my feelings, and so I decide to break up with her the next day, not wanting her to be in a relationship with a guy who doesn't return the same feelings. 

Now, normally, this would be a normal thing to do, if it weren't for the fact that I gave her a gift to show my love for her, the day before breaking up with her because I don't have any feelings for her anymore, which lead to all of her friends hating me.

As for me, I think I was totally the asshole in this situation, but what about you, strangers of reddit,  do you think I was an asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: Hello Reddit, we meet again through a throwaway. Not sure how to organise this, so please tell if you find something unnecessary/confusing and I'll edit it. I'll try my best to answer questions and be unbiased.

I'm 15F. And my friend, let's call her Laura, is 17F. Laura's always been really critical and sometimes very harsh with her words, sometimes towards me. I've dismissed it as just her personality, but there was one conversation that bothered me. 

In a group chat, the topic was ""people who don't talk unless they have something valuable to say"", and I started to say a lot from my perspective. I basically said that it's okay to say anything as long as you're doing no harm. 

Laura and another friend, let's call him Noah, started to make fun of me. I usually don't mind when people insult me as a joke. Laura, however, sounded pretty serious and I felt like she was just bashing me for no reason. She said things like ""she thinks she has something valuable to say"", and after I was done, she said ""you just gave us a lecture about something we never said was wrong, and I bet it was just because you wanted to talk"". I later messaged her about it, to see why exactly she did it. She said she was just making the point that I just don't stop talking. I still didn't really understand *why*, but I brushed it off as me nitpicking.

She also likes to write, so she wrote some descriptions of group members that were supposed to be nice. Mine was about 8 lines long, but there are some parts I thought were rude:

""she hasn't read half the books or seen anywhere near the required repertoire of films for the proper level of respect.""

""she's one of those psychopaths who actually likes maths.""

""all you need to know about her is that she's easy to make fun of.""

I wasn't sure if I was being oversensitive, so I messaged another member of the group chat about it. Let's call her Sarah. Sarah called it ""brutal"" compared to everyone else's descriptions. Sarah said that Laura basically called me a psychopath and undeserving of respect. So I decided to confront her about it. I also asked her if she feels pressured to agree with Noah or act like him (since he does make fun of me), because I know that she has feelings for him. Her response was basically denying that, and that she gets anxious and projects on others. We went off-topic and it basically turned into me trying to suggest solutions for her problems. It was still filled with those kinda snarky or rude comments I've been mentioning. It hasn't been brought up again since.

I really can't tell who's wrong here, I'm trying to see if I was hypocritical and made fun of her before or something but can't remember anything, or if she was even disrespectful at all. Regardless of whether I end up being the asshole or not, I'm not sure what the next step is.

input: I’m 26 my wife is 23. I work about 50-55 hour weeks doing 2 jobs at a factory, desk and stocking soda machines, so she can stay at home and take care of our 11 MO son. I come home and decompress for about 30/45 min before relieving her if mama duties for the night. I feed him, play with him, change him, and put him to sleep every night and all weekend long unless my mom babysits. During this 2 hour or 2 day window  I want her to either clean or cook or do something. I don’t do regular cleaning around the home, but neither does she. I do laundry, dishes, trash. And all the difficult things with our son like clip his nails or clean his nose out (cuz he’ll scream bloody murder). I just want her to clean up more often too. She’ll only clean if someone she cares about is coming over.  What she does usually the entire time I’m home is watch videos on her phone or streamed on the tv. After the boy is asleep around 9pm I don’t want to do anything to else but rest but the home is a mess and it makes me restless. Tonight I went on a cleaning binge out being sick of it. AITA?

input: I have been friends with this girl since 6th grade (im currently a junior in college). We dont see eachother a lot because i go to college an 18 hour drive away. 
She says she doesnt want a job she doesnt like so refuses to get any job. But then she complains that she has no money. Shes blames her parents for not teaching her how to drive so she cant get her lisence. She wants to somehow get money for the government for her epilspy that she had 6 years ago. All she does all day is go on tinder to find a guy that will date her and buy her stuff basically so she can get things without working for it like she does now with her parents. She doesnt even leave the house ever she just watches tv and complains about her life and blames everyone else for the reason why she cant get her shit together. Sometimes shes get jelous of me and says how easy my life is (when its not) and sometimes ignores me because she ""cant relate to me when I do ""cool"" stuff"". In one case the ""cool stuff"" was going to canada for spring break.
I would consider myself as pretty ambitous and I dont like to complain a lot so that fact that all she does is complain and not take responsbility for her life annoys me. She was my best friend for so many years and the sweetest person ever. 

TLDR: childhood best friend annoys me by constantly complaining about her life but refuses to do anything to change it.

input: Hi, I’ll keep this short and sweet. I have a friend, not a very good one, who tends to be an asshole with people including me and the rest of our friend group. He’s just an overall very unfriendly and abrasive guy.

His girlfriend of two years broke up with him about a month ago, and he did not SEEM affected by it, of course he could’ve hid it well. So he has been talking to this other girl for maybe two weeks, and whenever I talk with him, if she comes up he will always talk about how he’s gonna “fuck her brains out” and things of that nature.

So I told her and she was disgusted by how he talked about her to us, let alone talking about this stuff before they did anything and before it’s gotten serious. She confronted this to him, and told him that I had told her, about the stuff he says and so she broke up with him.

Am I the asshole for warning her about this? Because now he won’t talk to me, and some of my closer friends in this group have made it very clear that I’m not welcome.

So my gf and I were together for 7 months but argument started to occur due to lack of communication. After about a week about more arguing/consolidating we decided that being friends with benefits (fuck buddies). This obviously didn't work as we caught feelings for each other and were currently in a limbo between relationship and FwB 

So yesterday for Valentine's we went to see a movie (Marie Queen of Scots) and went for a coffee b4 I kissed her goodbye and left for my train which was delayed *Ffs greater anglia*.
Before I left I asked what are we and she quoted me by saying, go with the flow. I assumed were together but I'll update on how it goes.

No we want to fuck tomorrow but she's starting her period. Now while I was her bf I would have been 100% ok with it. Like I don't like it but I would put up with it for her. Now we're in our current state I REALLY don't like blood on my dick (oh we usually go bare back). I never really gave a response b4 she went to bed but would IBTA if I cancelled tomorrow?

Now complete the following example-
input: A little bit of backstory: We're both 17, I'm a male and she's a female. I'm fairly considerate, as in I often give my friends stuff (for example cakes my mother makes), and so does she. A couple of times i asked her if she wanted me to bring her cake or whatever to school, and she always declined. One time i talked to her about it, and it concluded with her saying ""i don't want anything from you"" (as in material stuff i hope, anyways it's an awful thing to say). So, i kind of got mad because she never accepted my stuff but i always accepted her's. Also i confessed her love a month ago, which didn't end well because she was flirting with the other guy at the moment, but everything was pretty normal in our relationship since then, not even uncomfortable.

Today we had a fight about it. She brought me a chocolate bar i like, i declined, she kind of begged me to take it (begged is obviously too hard of a word). I didn't accept it in the end, and because she didn't want it back i just left it laying on a table (she saw that). After that she was mad about me not accepting her ""attention"", and saying, and i quote, ""i'll stop with acts of kindness/attention, so you won't have anything to decline, it will be easier on you, do what you want. I don't want to lose any more nerves on you, just know, ever again"". I shrugged at that statement, saying that i have no problem with her decision and that i didn't want to hurt her or anything. Also that i too feel bad about her not recieving my ""attention"". She was just really mad that she had to beg me to take her ""kindness"", because she thinks i humiliated her. I was pretty calm entire time, i told her that i really appriciate her kindness apart from not taking my favorite candy. She didn't really accept that, and is angry.

I hope i didn't give out too one-sided perspective, and i feel bad and dumb about this situation. Didn't really want a fight, and i literally had 0 problems with her, ever. But i really don't want to say sorry. How right am i?

**TL;DR** i got mad at my best friend for saying ""i don't want anything from you"", so i declined her next casual gift. She thinks i humiliated her because i so stubbornly declined, and is now angry at me.

input: So I've been best of friends with a girl I met a few years ago, before I started dating my now fiance, we'll call her Marta.  She's been stanning our relationship since day one. Has basically been saying she's going to be my bridesmaid if we ever get married. 

Over the years she's become one of my closest friends and I'd do anything for her and she seemed to feel the same way.  She's also kind of a flake due to some severe social anxiety, but mostly, has been there for me and has really cared for me.

December, my boyfriend proposed to me and she couldn't be more happy about it. Her dreams come true, she totally knows she's gonna be my bridesmaid. We set the date for May 16, 2020 and she's known for weeks.

I officially ask her to be my bridesmaid last week, card and gift and all.. she's thrilled! Next day I get the text that she didn't put 2 and 2 together.. she's booked for May 16, 2020. Her friend from growing up owns a dance studio and she does the photography/lighting for this three day dance recital. No one else can do this job.  She's not getting paid for this, it's totally volunteer, and it's 15 months from now. She's not even trying to find a replacement. She's flaked. 

I feel like she's choosing a volunteer position over my wedding.  She has said that dance is a big part of her life and it's really important to her.  She says I should be more understanding.  I can't see myself staying friends with her after this. AITA for cutting her out?

tl;dr my best friend has a volunteer commitment 1.5 years in advance and is choosing that over being a bridesmaid in my wedding.

She right away said that it's a joke, but I knew it wasn't, because this isn't the first time and she was dead serious last time and I told her this. She immediatly fired back with why am I so salty and things like that, and my response was that she's always hurt that everybody leaves from her company, but she fails to realise that what she does is wrong, and I gave her the example of why one of our mutual friends doesn't talk to her anymore, which was that she straight up called herself Allah. And when the guy who worshipped Allah blocked her, she messaged me saying how that guy is a cry baby, and she is right. She outright denied that she ever said these, even after I showed proof. And after that she started attacking me saying how I'm a loser, and how I will always be lonely, and I'm pathetic, and she brought up the problems I currently have with my family, and said nobody can be sadder than this man. So as a last thing I told her ""I will always be happier than you because atleast I see my faults"". And I left the group. After this I asked my friend if she said anything about the incident, and the only thing she said is that these are the early signs of autism. And around 2 hours ago I saw her instagram story, saying that everybody she cares about is abandoning her, even though she didn't do anything, and she's always to get hurt.

I'm really on the fence here.  Obviously I didn't write down more personal things, but this was the core of the argument

input: My best friend's girlfriend (27F) has a medical condition (Lupus) which affects her quite a lot. She gets tired really easily, has joint pains and gets fevers and headaches a lot. She has a decently paying job in an office, although can only work part time, and lives with her parents who are quite well-off so she doesn't pay rent or utilities or anything. She only recently became part of my friend group when she started dating my best friend, she is great and everyone really likes her. Whenever we do anything with her she isn't expected to pay, either her boyfriend pays or the rest of us just split the cost. I don't really agree with it since she has a job and lives rent/utilities free, but I go along with it since it's usually just like splitting her meal between 4 or 5 of us or something. We are planning a trip around Europe for 5 of us, including this girl. Her boyfriend wants us to split the cost for her to come, including flights, accomodation, food, etc. I don't see why we have to pay for her. She must have plenty money to spend since she lives with her parents and I don't think she really needs us to pay. I haven't spoken to anyone about this and am worried I am being an asshole because of her condition.

input: (I posted this on r/acting and decided it would probably work well here too. I added to the story so it was more interesting) Hello! Let's just have some background on this story. 

  I've gotten a role for my first play ever. It's at my school, so it's not the most professional. I'm not super picky with roles. There was one role I really wanted. We'll call this role S. S was a main role. She was smart and funny. One of my friends (A) wanted to smaller roles, F and T. It turns out that I got F and T, and she got S. She was mad, and originally I was to. We talked about asking to switch roles. The day we agreed to, she went home early, so I was alone. I don't like confrontation, so I got really nervous. One of my friends helped me out, and I asked the director. He said he would think about it. I played as S, F, and T throughout the entire rehearsal. I became much more comfortable with the roles, and embraced them.  I don't know how A feels still. I'm worried that she'll bother the director enough to get our roles switched. She is a better actor than I am, and I think she'll do better as this role. She also looks the part much better than I do. She can get kind of angry sometimes. I worry she'll still want F and T. I like my roles, and don't want to switch. I'm willing to fight for this. AITA for changing my mind, and not caring what my friend thinks?

Now complete the following example-
input: This isn’t one of those validation posts, though the title may seem that way. I’m being accused by my now ex of being the asshole.

Yesterday was my birthday, so my boyfriend picked me up to go out to eat when he got off work. We noticed two dogs on the side of the road, wearing collars/tags, and I insisted we stop and try to save them, though he did not want to. I got out of the car and was walking toward them, when two men on bicycles came from the other direction, so the dogs ran across the road, and one was hit by a car. We managed to get the dog out of the road, and I asked my boyfriend if we could take the dog to the emergency vet. He agreed, unfortunately the dog died on the way. 

He subsequently was upset because he was worried about the interior of his car, which I did offer to have professionally cleaned. As I sat there crying, clearly very upset, and said that had I not stopped, the dogs wouldn’t have crossed the road and died, he just said, “probably.” No words of comfort. Though I do believe it was my fault, I was still traumatized. Had he been upset and crying, even if I disagreed about why, I’d try to comfort him. He took me to a bar after, though I just wanted to go home, and freaked out when he finished his drink and I asked him to take me home. I got out of his car and shut the door harder than I intended (100% my fault) and said I’d talk to him the next day. He peeled out, and I was worried he’d get hurt driving like a maniac. I asked him to let me know when he got home, and one hour later with no message, I kept calling and then got sent to voicemail.  At least then I knew he was alive and not in a ditch somewhere. Either way, I sent a text breaking up with him, because he had been a complete jerk and then didn’t let me know he was home safe (I’d also like to point out, I’m not asking if I’m the asshole about the breakup. I shouldn’t have done it the way I did, that definitely makes me an asshole. But it’s also been coming for a few months. Every single person in my life told me they didn’t feel he was right for me, and this was just the last straw for me. We definitely had other issues, both his fault and mine. We just aren’t right for one another.) 

At the end of this, I think he’s an asshole because he cared more about his cars interior than the life of the dog, and treated me like I was the asshole for not caring about his car. Also for not letting me know and sending me to voicemail when I wanted to know he was home safe. And I will admit, I was upset and not looking at it from his perspective, which is why I had wanted to talk about it the next day, when we were both calmer. And he thinks I’m the asshole because he can’t really afford his car and wants to get rid of it as soon as he can, and the dog could have damaged his interior (which he did not I mention before we put the dog in the car, and the interior was not damaged, as the dog was not bleeding.)

So, Reddit, AITA, or is he?

Now complete the following example-
input: I (26M) recently got a bit upset after a conversation with my parents. It wasn’t much of a big deal, they just left me feeling slightly undervalued and a bit down.

When my girlfriend (25F) and I got home she could tell that I was upset and tried to comfort me. I realised that this feeling about my parents wasn’t particularly meaningful, and I would get over it after sleeping on it, but my girlfriend then got upset that she wasn’t able to successfully comfort me enough to stop me from being grumpy.

We end up getting into a minor argument because she had exhausted her efforts to try and cheer me up but I remain to be in a generally melancholic mood. My argument is that I feel I just need time to get over it and be cheery again, I can’t simply snap out of feeling a bit down. I suppose she might feel either like she is failing in what she might see as her role as my girlfriend to cheer me up, or perhaps she feels unappreciated herself by me and got frustrated. But I don’t think I can just decide to start being cheerful and forget about being upset with my parents. And I don’t want to just effectively lie to her and pretend that yes I am now all better even when I don’t feel it myself.

I can understand why she’d be frustrated, but AITA for not being able to just cheer up?

Now complete the following example-
input: My girlfriend and I have been together almost 10 years and have a 3 year old together. She works part time at the moment so money is a little tight. We're basically living paycheck to paycheck.

This month my gf got paid a little less than usual and won't be able to pay her half of rent and daycare. Which normally wouldn't be a big deal because earlier when she's been a little low on cash, she at least chips in a little bit towards those two things. I pay literally every other expense that we have. Streaming services, electric bill, gas, car insurance, everything. Which again is fine as long as she chips in on the two biggest expenses.

But this month she tells me she can't pay anything because she's going away for the weekend with some people from her choir. And that the hotel is going to cost pretty much half her salary. I get mad because I think her priorities are stupid and that she should have saved up for this trip months ago. She gets mad at me for being mad at her and just tells me it's her money and she can do what she wants with it.

AITA for thinking she should use her money to support our child and pay rent, instead of going on this expensive weekend?

Now complete the following example-
input: Earlier today I was out on a cold walk with my wife in the countryside. The lake had frozen over, and I was absentmindedly throwing stones into it to make that weird sound that lakes make when you throw stones on them when frozen. A guy pulls up in his van, rolls down his window, and the following conversation happens:

&amp;#x200B;

Him: \[...\] throwing stones in the lake?

Me: Uhh what?

Him: What the fuck do you think you're doing? They're expensive fish in there.

Me: I'm sorry... I didn't think it would be...

Him: You didn't think?? You're a grown man! Look at that fucking mess!

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I didn't get to respond, as he drove on to turn his van around -- I'm glad I didn't, because what had occurred to me was ""They're just stones on an ice lake, it's not like I'm vandalising"". I think if I had said it, it would have only escalated the situation.

A woman, who was walking with her family close by, asked me what he said ""He seems to have a problem with me throwing stones in the lake!"" I responded. At this point, I noticed that he was turning back and I didn't want to give him any more of a reason to be pissed off at me, so I pulled myself and my wife out of the way in anticipation of where he was going to be driving. We were now out of the direction of where his van could go and he stopped his van again and for the second time said something I could only catch the end of:

&amp;#x200B;

Him: \[...\] run you over!

Woman: What? You'll run me over?

Him: No, I said \_he\_ should get out the way because I \_don't\_ want to run him over. Don't get fucking mouthy with me!

Woman's husband: What did he just say to you?

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, the woman's husband appeared to be following the van and wanted some kind of conflict. My wife and I just left that area and walked off somewhere else; I didn't want to anything to do with that. It's not in my nature to want conflict over anything, not least of all over stones on a lake.

So here's the thing, the guy was confrontational and seemed to really want a fight with just about anyone. That said, him being confrontational by nature doesn't automatically make him an asshole, and certainly doesn't prevent me from being an asshole. I looked it up and found that apparently breaking ice with stones on a lake can indeed harm fish, so whether or not the guy handled it in the right way, he was right to call me out in doing something wrong. Not that I knew it would harm fish at the time. But the impression I had was that I was vandalising the lake with stones -- now admittedly they were large stones... like rocks... bigger than an apple I guess, but it has never occurred to me before that stones on a lake could be considered any kind of vandalism.

I feel like the fish being ""expensive"", and the ""mess"" I made aren't really an issue. If I knew I was harming fish I wouldn't have done it. So I guess in addition to AITA, I guess my question is: Is it vandalism to throw stones, or even large rocks onto an ice lake?

Spent the day with a very dear friend who always uses the wrong words and also mispronounces words. I don't correct her, because I've always figured it's rude. I won't deny that it annoys the hell out of me. Anyway, we went all over town browsing furniture stores, shopping for nothing in particular, when I observed that I liked the look of a certain dining room suite. She said, ""It's a *suit.*"" Okay. I know she always says ""suit."" That isn't going to make *me* say it that way. I looked at her and rolled my eyes. 

""Well,"" she said ""I'm just trying to help. I know you don't want to run around sounding like an idiot.""

""Thanks, but you are the one who sounds like an idiot. Google it or something."" She got on her phone and I guess must have looked it up, but commented, ""It might be spelled with and ""e,"" but it's silent."" I probably rolled my eyes again, but didn't say anything.

Later, she said, ""Hey look at the price of that CHESTER DRAWER!""  

""I believe you meant to say, 'chest of drawers?"" She didn't respond.

We were driving home. I passed up an opportunity to correct ""pacifically,"" ""rod iron,"" and ""touch basis"" but I did correct her when she said she hated driving under ""viadocks"" in the rain.

That prompted her to stop talking. She just sat there staring ahead until we got to her her house. She got out of the car, slammed the door, and hasn't responded to any texts.

My one friend whose been asking stupid questions all night told me to get out of his fucking room for that question when i was just fucking asking.

Now complete the following example-
input: Let me preface this a little. 

I graduated college a semester early and moved back home while job shadowing and waiting to get into grad schools. Since I have no money, my parents are actually paying for what I used at college (ie- rent, utilities). I have lived with my roommates for a couple years. Every summer, we agreed that the roommate who lives there pays the utilities that are fluid, meaning they change with amount of usage. These utilities are- gas, water, electric. 

So, since I have moved home, my roommates are still wanting me to pay 1/3 of the gas, water, and electric. I said no because my parents are already letting me live here rent free and paying for what I use here. I also do not contribute to the usage of said utilities, so the **prices went down**. They said that they were not ""comfortable"" paying 50/50 because it was not fully discussed, even though we have done this the past two summers. AITA here???? I have not used any water, gas, or electric, so I am actually confused as to why I should be paying? I told them I would pay the bills that didn't fluctuate, because I thought that was fair since we all signed off on Wifi/cable. I am trying to discuss this with them, but they just don't respond, except for saying they are not comfortable paying it. 

Also, just to add, one roommate has a bf that essentially lives there without actually being on the lease. He does not go to school, and sits in the house most dat. He uses MUCH more water, gas, and electric than me, so why is he getting it for free?

If anyone can contribute feedback or solution I would really appreciate it! 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR i am not using utilities so why should I have to contribute?

Now complete the following example-
input: Context: I live in some townhomes that are independently owned, but many are owned and rented out. We rent and the people next door rent as well (from different landlords). The HOA rules state that no dogs are allowed. We got an exception because I have a ten pound, very well-behaved dog. He barks when someone knocks on the door but other than that I doubt anyone in our neighborhood knows he exists. It’s important though that we actually have permission to have a dog. We didn’t sneak him past anyone. Most of the neighbors do have dogs. It isn’t a well kept secret, but it doesn’t bother us. 

The neighbors directly next door, though, are starting to be a problem. They have two big breed dogs in a ting apartment. They only let them out on to a tiny patio. It’s the kind of dog we want- but refuse to get yet because they deserve (and need)  a massive yard. When the owners aren’t home the dogs whine / groan all day. It’s a sad sound that makes my dog pace. For hours a day. When they come home they put the dogs upstairs and begin band practice. 

Band practice is another issue. For a townhome with thin walls I don’t know why they’ve decided to practice here every night. It’s gotten louder as time goes on. At first, we were just like “well they pay to live here too”. But then it started going later and later and getting louder and louder. To the point where we can’t watch tv because we can’t hear it. We’ve asked them to turn it down twice and they’ve been very nice and complied. But I don’t think we should *have* to ask. 

During band practice the dogs are even more worked up, too. They know people are home so they bark to hang out. And then get yelled at to shut up. The yelling makes it even worse. 

I can’t really drown it out. White noise isn’t enough unless I’m wearing headphones. I shouldn’t have to wear those 24/7 in my own home though. 

WIBTA if I turned them in for having dogs, even though I have one? I know it’d result in them violating the lease and being made to move immediately (or sadly giving the dogs up, which I don’t want- but they are not being cared for) while complaining about the music would be a slower process.

Now complete the following example-
input: I was at the local gym and was really pumped to try a new workout routine I read about. It was about 5:45pm on a Tuesday, so the place was packed with after-work crowds getting in a workout before dinner. I was working on a quick circuit with a treadmill, some free weights, and a bench. I notice a pretty jacked dude getting setup for his bench presses, which is right next to my bench. Though he looked jacked, he definitely couldn't easily lift the weights he had and was really struggling, and making loud annoying breathing sounds. I HATE THAT, it immediately makes me want to make eye contact and scream.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. dude loudly finishes his bench press set, after which he begins getting free weights for some squats, again right next to my area. Again, he picks up at least twenty pounds too much and begins to squat and almost fall over into me. I felt I had to constantly move my gear further away because of him. During his last set, I was finishing up some curls and heard that annoying loud breathing sound. I had enough, so I dropped my weights and walked up to him and looked him dead in his sweaty eyes and yelled ""SHUT UP AND SQUAT! He was so taken aback, he didn't know what to do...so he dropped his weights and proceeded to walk over to the security desk to report my lashing out.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm banned from the gym, even though I was working out quietly like any normal human being. WTF?!

Now complete the following example-
input: So my boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years. He’s a very talented musician. He was in a band when we met. About a year into our relationship he joined a different band that’s much more involved. They’re moderately successful. They usually tour April-September ish. honestly, it depends on the festival season and a ton of other stuff. Also, I live in Virginia because of him. I moved here about 5 and a half years ago to help my brother and his wife out with their baby. They’re military and got transferred elsewhere about 2 years ago. My boyfriend and his family are the only family I have on this coast. ALSO I’m a flight attendant based in Boston so I travel a lot and don’t have a traditional work environment to make friends. I don’t really have any friends in Virginia. My boyfriend and his family are literally all I have here.

Since college I’ve always been a bit weird about my birthday. My birthday was always over spring break so I never really got to celebrate it. I can honestly recount every single birthday I’ve had since I met my boyfriend. A few of them have been disappointing and we’ve had issues with it before. He knows it’s important to me and the last few years he’s really tried to make it special.

A couple weeks ago his band’s manager posted on their instagram that they were going to be playing at Savannah Stopover which is March 7th-8th. This was the first I’d heard of it and my birthday is the 5th. It’s at least a day’s drive down there so I asked him if he was going to be gone for my birthday. I just wanted to be prepared if he was. He said no he should be home, and that was the start of a couple weeks on the road so they probably wouldn’t be leaving until the 7th or the 6th at the very earliest. I asked him if he was sure and he said he was pretty sure. 

This morning I brought it up again. He said he couldn’t imagine them leaving before the 6th and that he was pretty sure that was the start of the tour. I asked him point blank: “are you *really* not sure or do you know you’re going to be gone for my birthday and you just want to say?” He said “babe, I’m telling you what I know.” 

I took that to heart and started planning my birthday this afternoon. I texted my best friend who lives in Boston (and is also a flight attendant) and asked her if she wanted to come visit for for my bday. She of course said yes. I said to her “all I want for my birthday is to go to brunch and then day-drink and watch movies at home with you, boyfriend, and the kitties.”

The band has been recording some new songs about 30 min away from here. He left not long after our conversation. When he got home this evening this is the conversation we had:


me: I invited *bff* to come down for my birthday, I hope that’s okay.

bf: oooh about that. We have a show.

me: excuse me? what? we just talked about this less than 12 hours ago.

bf: yeah *band manager* reminded me today. we talked about it over email a few months ago and I totally forgot I said it was fine.

me: what? you just said today you didn’t have any shows before savannah stopover. how did you not only forget this conversation but also forget that’s my birthday!?

bf: sorry if was over email a few weeks ago and I just didn’t notice. 

me: seriously what the fuck I’ve asked you about this multiple times over the last few weeks.

bf: it wasn’t on purpose I didn’t even realize it was your birthday but even if I had I would have still said yes because it’s $1700 and we could use the money.

I was speechless at that. He tried to hug me and I told him to go to bed and he went upstairs. I’m downstairs drinking wine and stewing. My feelings are really hurt. He’s come down once since and didn’t say too much but suggested I could come to the show on my birthday and tried to hug me. I pushed him off and told him to go to bed.

Three years ago I went to New York for a show on my birthday and he didn’t tell anyone it was my birthday. It may as well have just been a regular day. I’m not trying to do that again. Not to mention the fact that we have cats now so if he’s gone and I go too then we have to get someone to take care of them. 


I don’t know where to go from here. I’m really upset and my feelings are really hurt. I realize this is definitely a first world problem but he knows how I feel about my birthday and could have done so many things differently to not make me feel so shitty. I really don’t think I’m the asshole here but I want to make sure before I make a big thing of it. If I’m the asshole here I’ll try to accept it and stop being upset at him. I know not everyone cares about their birthdays the way I do. 

Very interested in outside opinions.

input: To give a little backstory, my girlfriend (who I’ll call Ann) and I have been dating for almost a year now and we’ve been going pretty smoothly. I introduced her to my friend (who will be called Bob) who introduced her to his boyfriend (who will be called Jim,), everyone got along well. One day I get a text from Bob  saying that Ann and Jim are over at his and asking if I want to come up as well. I reject the offer as I was pretty ill that day, he sent me a few images of them having fun together, she texted me a few times. I had gotten a text later from Bob showing a picture of her T-shirt pulled downed a bit showing her bra, I texted her asking if she was alright and she replied that Jim and Bob were poking her breasts and ass and that she felt a little uncomfortable (in case anyone asks, they were bisexual).

Fast forward a few months, Jim and Bob have broken up and we all, more or less, cut off contact with Bob and Jim and Ann are best of friends. Now Jim personality is very flirty and that can make me a bit jealous at times, though Ann never flirts back. I was texting her one day and I ask her “What’s up?” And she replies “I’m on the way to [insert my hometowns name]” I ask her what’s she’s gonna do here as she hadn’t texted me beforehand to ask if I wanted to hang out, she said that Jim and her were gonna hang out and asked if I wanted to come along, I responded with a simple “Yes.” They both come of the bus and I greet her with a hug and say hello to Jim (who had also came on the bus) and they two immediately got to talking, I just kind of floated around feeling a bit like a third wheel. We eventually got to the town centre and I told them that I was gonna run home quickly to get a coat as it was a bit chilly and for them to wait there. When I returned we continued walking around. Fast forward to the end of the night, I got into a small argument with Ann about drinking, she felt like I was a bit too restrictive with it (I don’t drink) and basically didn’t want her drinking because she doesn’t handle it well. I stormed off back home. I apologised next morning through text and admitted that I had been a massive asshole. 

Fast forward to about a week or two ago, I had, more or less, come to the conclusion that Jim didn’t like me very much, I talked to Ann about this and she kinda confirmed this. We basically talked about Jim for a while, and that I especially disliked him for showering her with compliments. She revealed to me that after I went to get my coat, they had talked about me (he had basically said that I seemed a bit insensitive), and after the argument over alcohol he had encouraged her to break up with me (she didn’t, luckily), and I have grown to have a big disliking of him. Am I an asshole for wanting her to stop being his friend?

tl;dr - My girlfriend best friend poked her ass, flirts with her, dislikes me and encouraged her to break up with me.

Now complete the following example-
input:   

One year ago, during the spring semester of my freshman year at college, I started dating my first girlfriend, and my roommate, being a good friend, would leave the room 3-5 times a week for several hours late at night so that we could spend time in there. However, I never explicitly told him to leave in a hostile way, and I always made it clear that he wouldn’t have to leave if he didn’t want to. She would also spend the night maybe 1-2 times a week, but I also would ask him if it was OK each time and made sure I had the green light. For about the first month or so, we did abuse the room usage. A couple times he stayed outside the room until past midnight. After this, he expressed annoyance at me, and eventually I realized I was being an asshole. Even though I never explicitly told him he couldn’t come back in, I was taking advantage of his kindness by asking for extreme hours of having the room to myself.

Over the summer, we talked about the situation and I apologized, and said that I would try to be a better roommate. The next semester (fall) we were once again sharing a room, and this time I tried to hang out at my girlfriend’s place more. My girlfriend and I usually study together almost every day.  Although there is a living room, I prefer studying in my room because I have a desk setup with a monitor, and there are usually people in the living room watching TV or talking. We were in my room 3 times or less a week and spent the other days at her place or on campus, and I never commanded him to leave the room, but I did ask about 4 times over the course of the semester when I knew he didn't have anything important to do. A couple of these times were late at night but did not alter his sleeping schedule since he sleeps very late. I tried to schedule sex around his schedule, but he rarely leaves the room, and only attended one of his classes, which my girlfriend was also taking. He was generally in the room 24/7 (except to make a quick food run), but he would leave the room 2x a week for a couple hours or less when we studied in there, even though I never asked him to. 

From his point of view, he said that he feels a societal pressure, and that we wanted him to leave the room when we were just there studying. I always tried to make it clear that he didn’t have to leave, ever, if he didn’t want to, and told him this many times.  Also, my girlfriend and I are very quiet, and spend most of the time in the room studying. She would sit on my bed and study and I would sit at my desk. We didn’t talk loudly or laugh loudly. However, my roommate was still extremely frustrated that he had to deal with me and my girlfriend. He always said that us being in the room made him leave and complained that we “locked him out” to me and our friends. He said he feels like a dog being let in and out of his room.

Fast forward to this semester, because of his increasing frustration, I tried to have my girlfriend in the room even less. Since the start of the semester, we haven’t been in the same room as him more than 30 minutes (such as right before or after we go to an event), and I only have sex with her when he leaves the apartment. There were 3 times he came back to the room while we were having sex and knocked on the door. At this point I really don’t want him to be annoyed so as soon as he knocks my girlfriend and I put on our clothes, no matter where we are, and rush out of the room to not bother him. This would take 2-5 minutes tops, but each time this happened I could tell he was really angry. I should have given him a warning that we were using the room, but I didn’t want to make him feel like he was locked out of the room, and I made sure to leave immediately each time he came back. The last time we did this, last weekend, was when some of our friends came over. My roommate and about five of our friends were playing smash (a video game), and my girlfriend and I were kind of just sitting there not playing. We went into the room and it eventually led to sex. Later, as our friends are leaving, he says that he is very annoyed at me. 

Yes, I admit having sex while our friends were over was a really cringy thing to do, and I wouldn’t do it again. However, my roommate is super angry at me. He called me selfish and ungrateful for what he has done for me and tells me that I’m an asshole. He also said that if I asked anyone else that they’d tell me I was an asshole. Honestly, I’m not sure what other people would think since I haven’t explained the whole situation that much to others. I know I was an asshole in the beginning of the relationship but since then I’ve tried to be with my girlfriend around him less and less, so I don’t really feel like an asshole at the moment. So reddit, AITA?

TL;DR

I got a girlfriend and we used to spend a lot of time in the room, but now we spend almost no time in the room when he’s there, and he still thinks I’m an asshole.

input: My boyfriend (well just call him M) and I are creators on Instagram (he is also on TikTok). I'm a digital and traditional artist and in one of my classes we create t shirts and things (socks, lanyards, water bottles, stickers, you name it). I'm a big fan of putting my art on t shirts so I can sell them.

M wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

Am I the asshole for wanting to wear the shirt I made just once?
output: wanting to wear a shirt

input: Pretty much was hanging out with two friends. I was watching the Lakers game. They won at the very last minute and I immediately hopped up and celebrated. Before I could even finish celebrating one friend started going on about how the Lakers suck. It just pissed me off so much I screamed at her to get out my room until she left. 


She knows I'm a huge fan and she likes them too. She was only saying it to antagonize me. Am I the dick here?

Now complete the following example-
input: I was seeing a girl for just over 3 months, we would see each other roughly 4-5 times a week so it was quite often I saw her. We did a lot of fun activities in this time that it was like we were dating, but not with the official ""relationship' tag yet. We had talked about this quite heavily and we were going to wait until sometime in the early new year (this year), we both wanted to wait until this year so it was all mutual. We both were quite regularly in each other's lives that we had met friends and parents etc.

&amp;#x200B;

But now on to the question, it was New Year's Eve (just been) and we had already agreed to a plan that I would hang out with my friends earlier on in the day for a few drinks and then we would catch up together when we went out for the night life. Once it got to New Year's Eve she tried to persuade me to spend the whole day with her without getting to see my friends at all &amp; I of course said no, because this was the plan for my friends and I before I started seeing her. 

&amp;#x200B;

She didn't like this answer and told me that she didn't wanted to speak to me (just for not wanting to spend the whole day with her when I was going to see her later on in the night anyway). I tried reasoning but to no avail. I put on a happy face and had a good New Years. I then wake up on New Years day to a text from her telling me that she was really sorry and that she kissed someone last night, and that she would do anything for my forgiveness. I was upset but I wasn't going to let a little kiss (presumably when she was drunk) ruin the amount of time we've spent together. So we sorted it out, but 2 days later I found out that she also had sex with this person from a mutual friend early morning. Since she wasn't staying at mine that night I sent her a text message about it and she told me everything, my very last response to her was ""I don't know what to say anymore"", I was in utter shock. I didn't contact her again.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I The Asshole for not telling her that I didn't want to continue what we had? It's been twenty-ish days since this happened and I still feel guilty I didn't properly tell her. Also keep in mind that she has tried contacting me a few times since then &amp; that we weren't technically in a relationship but I still was 100% invested in her.

Now complete the following example-
input: So for context, I live in an area where although marijuana is illegal, it's not strictly enforced. The police normally just take the weed and be on their way. He's approaching 18 years of age.

He does it consistently every day, comes back late and high when my parents are asleep and I'm just going to bed. I wouldn't normally care, he's got a job and he can do whatever he wants, but a couple of things have changed.

One : He's getting quite a bit into debt with my parents, they've lent him money for a new car after he crashed his old one, he has a crap ton of insurance to pay, and has racked up about 10-12 parking tickets (that I know of), that he refuses to pay.

Two : He's driving constantly while high. I've heard it's not as bad as drink driving, but given that he drives badly anyway it's slightly worrying.

Would I be the asshole for snitching? I generally don't feel comfortable with the idea, but I think my parents have a right to know if they're helping finance him. I did tell him I wouldn't tell our parents when I first asked him about it, but have since regretted saying that.

Now complete the following example-
input: There's more backstory here but I feel like it might actually just cloud the answers(happy to expand on this if asked). My sister's bf thinks I am maliciously gaslighting him and trying to mess up his life, my response was that I don't really think about him all that much and maybe this is his diagnosed paranoia/anxiety cropping up? 

&amp;#x200B;

That comment made him very upset and he actually used the word asshole in his response...sooo am I the asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: So I’ve got a really close friend who recently came out to me as MtF transgender. We’ve always gotten along really well, but since she’s started her transition Ive started to get the feeling that she’s been copying me - a lot. 

It started off with little things. She talked about really looking up to my style and asked to go thrifting with me. Of course I agreed. But over the past few months she’s started doing more and more of the same things as me- poetry, yoga, listening to the same music, watching the same shows. I wouldn’t mind if she was just taking inspiration from me or if she only did a few of these things, but I’m genuinely feeling like she is taking my entire personality. 

So far, I haven’t been able to bring myself to say anything to her. I know that transitioning is difficult and that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery— but I also don’t think it’s an excuse to copy every aspect of my style, interests, and personality. I don’t want to cut ties with her because she’s genuinely a really good person, but right now I’m honestly resenting her too much to think straight. Am I the asshole? 
output: ",asking my trans friend to stop copying my style
