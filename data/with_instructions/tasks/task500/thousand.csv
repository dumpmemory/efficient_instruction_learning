input: My boyfriend (well just call him M) and I are creators on Instagram (he is also on TikTok). I'm a digital and traditional artist and in one of my classes we create t shirts and things (socks, lanyards, water bottles, stickers, you name it). I'm a big fan of putting my art on t shirts so I can sell them.

M wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

input: Im making a throwaway account because i don't want anyone to know this and this has had a really big emotional toll on me so please be respectful in the comments. I want to know who's in the wrong but please be respectful when doing so. So i've been dating my girlfriend for a few months now and i really felt like she was the one for me. I thought we were getting married. I remember when we were dating she used to talk about how wedgies were funny and she would give me them a lot. I did it to her a couple times back and i felt it was weird she seemed to enjoy them. She would even ask me to give her them too which was even weirder. Wedgies are supposed to be a prank, they hurt and are embarrassing, definitely not enjoyable to receive one. She was giving me wedgies every time we hung out and it was getting really really annoying and i'd tell her to stop. She'd calm for a bit but then revert to it. Eventually we're hanging out and she leaves to go the bathroom. I go on her computer to look up flight tickets or something and i see a closed tab of a youtube compilation of guys getting wedgies. There was also one of guys getting wedgies on google images and thats when i realized that wedgies are some sort of weird fetish. This whole time i felt i've been violated. SHe'd only did it a couple times in public in front of my close friends or hers so it wasn't that big of a deal but now knowing she gets sexual pleasure out of it I feel like she also cheated on me when she gave my guy friends wedgies too. I told her i figured out what is going on and that her wedgie fetish is disgusting and degerneate and i can't be with someone who gets turned on by that. She starts crying and she's on her knees begging me to not leave her and give her another chance and to find a way to work things out. I leave and everyday i get missed calls and texts which I've been ignoring. I'm considering maybe giving her a second chance but idk. AITA here? all my friends think so and her friends have been harassing me nonstop, i had to block them all on social media. Should i give me gf another chance or did she violate me? I really feel if the gender roles were swapped I would be considered the asshole

Now complete the following example-
input: So I often drink a couple of beers after work to wind down (not every day, but it’s a normal thing for me). Tonight I was watching tv and my son asked if he could try some. I held the bottle and let him have a small sip. I thought he might spit it out but he just kind of made a small face and that was it. 

My wife was right there when it happened and she gets this horrified look on her face. I say “he just had a small sip”. She said nothing and ends up putting our son down to bed and proceeds to let me have it in a the weird hushed/scream voice she uses when she’s upset but wants to be quiet. 

She said she thought for sure I would tell him no when he asked and she can’t believe I gave him alcohol. I explained why I didn’t think it was a big deal but she’s still pretty angry. I guess I’ve always been more easygoing when it comes to parenting...

Anyway I’m just wondering if what I did sounds so terrible to the average person. I mean, it’s not like I let him chug the whole bottle! I figured he was just curious about the taste, and now he knows. Literally one sip and that was it. (Although if you ask my wife she’ll say he had a “gulp” of it). 

So was I the asshole in this situation? (Using a throwaway because I post in other parenting subs on my main, and I don’t want any judginess spilling over).

Now complete the following example-
input: So my friend and I have been super close for like five years now, but living together for only a year.  In that one year though I've grown to not like his behavior.

We run with a very tight knit group that all know who the type of person he is, and when you don't see him as much, is a great guy.  But he's had a history of changing how he acts based on friends we have hanging around us.  When he's around those people he begins to insult me and my other roommate, who's also a close friend of ours.

We've told him before how we don't appreciate him insulting us, especially when he doesn't do that to his other friends.  His response was just that he didn't mean it to be rude, he just thought since we were close he could.  Even though we don't ""joke"" back.

But there was a part where he crossed a line for me.

I work with kids, so naturally he thinks it's funny to call me a pedophile.  Not only to other friends, one who also works with me, but his online friends (he games)  that I've never met.  I tell him to not do that, and he persists.

I'm also very close to someone with a kid.  And one night I was playing with the child, in front of the friend.  The child wanted to play foot doctor and asked me to take off my shoe and sock.  I thought I was cute so I recorded the interaction and put it on a social media story.

He then puts me in a group chat with a friend of ours, and then goes on ask me why I have videos of little girls playing with my feet.  And saying that he thought it was creepy.  He knows that girl and my relation to the mother and that's where I drew the line.

I told him to go fuck himself and have yet to talk to him again.  I've let other people know that I'm currently not on good terms with him and they have essentially said ""that's just how he jokes"" and made me out to be the bad guy for being stuck up and sensitive about it.

I don't think it's personally funny, especially when it's the child of a very good friend of mine.

AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: My daughter is 9 and just started going to a new school in January because we moved. It is a public school in an urban city which is quite multicultural. She is half-Chinese and half-white. Although she is part Chinese, not many people can notice. Some have thought that she is Italian or Greek or even Irish for some reason.

Anyways, a month and a bit ago, my daughter came home a bit sad. I asked her what was wrong and she told me that in school, everyone shared what they did for the weekend. My daughter said that her family is Chinese so they celebrated Chinese New Year. The teacher (who is white) apparently told her “But you’re not Chinese. You shouldn’t lie.” My daughter said she felt embarassed in front of the whole class.

I was amused but also angry. I phoned her teacher and VERY CASUALLY told her that my daughter felt hurt by her being dismissive of her heritage. Her teacher was strangely defensive and asked me if I was accusing her of something. I said no and just that she should try being more open minded. 

A few days after this incident, my daughter said she felt like the teacher was treating her unfairly, namely refusing to let her go to the water fountain during class, giving her a “time out” for not lining up in time for recess, putting her on the spot to answer a question and berating her when she had the wrong answer. This time both my husband and I booked an appt to talk with the teacher, who was quite dismissive of us and very unhelpful. 

At this point it was affecting my daughter’s enjoyment of school. She would cry at night and beg me to send her back to her old school. Finally I had a talk with the principal, who told me that other parents have been accusing the teacher of racism in the past and said they’re trying to work with her. In the meantime my daughter was transferred to another class which worked out great.

Flash forward to last week when I was picking up my daughter from school. Her old teacher approached me and we made a bit of small talk, then she said casually, “Well Im not going to return to teach next year so I guess I can thank you.”

I was super taken aback. I told her I did NOT mean for her to lose her job. She then walked away from me.

I also learned from another parent that she was 4 kids and is a single mom. This made me extremely sad and I can’t help but feel guilty for playing a role in having her fired. My husband told me she was probably gonna get fired anyways and said I shouldn’t feel bad.

AITA though? I feel so so horrible knowing that she cannot support her 4 kids anymore partially because of my complaint against her.

input: I really can’t tell if I was being too insensitive or not. 

A few friends and I were invited to play some touch football at the beach one day with some random people we met who were throwing around a football. After a while we were getting out of breath from all the activity and one of the guys made a joke saying something like “I’m going to end up tearing my other ACL.”

He talked a bit about it a bit later on telling us how he tore his ACL in high school and how it sucked.

After a while of playing, we all getting very tired and almost falling over. I ended up tripping myself out of fatigue when running for the ball and said something along the lines of “I better watch out or I’ll end up tearing my ACL.”

After saying that, the guy who tore his ACL started to criticize me about how tearing an ACL is a serious thing and shouldn’t be joked about.

I understand tearing an ACL is serious but this guy seemed perfectly fine playing the game and I thought it wasn’t too serious of a thing for him since he was making a joke about it earlier. AITA?

I asked him to get out, and my memory is not perfect but it led to him punching me in the face. I got angry and punched him in the shoulder. He looked aghast and told me that I had to move out by tomorrow because he didn't want to son like me. I'm going to talk to him tomorrow and hope that we can come to some sort of compromise.

Now complete the following example-
input: So I just recently found this subreddit and figured I would share my story from a couple of years ago.

I was in the cinema with some friends watching Super Bowl. Patriots vs Falcons. We had booked our seats several weeks prior in order to get the best possible seats just below the walking area, so we could just jump down instead of having to go all the way around and inconvinience people.

When we got there some guy had taken the very center seat and refused to move. So after several minutes of confrontations and threatening with getting the usher he finally moved a couple of seats to the side. But before he could move he ""accidentally"" spilled cola on my seat. Now I spent the first quarter of the game sitting on a soaking wet seat. This was so fucking frustrating and I had a hard time enjoying myself for what is a fun night of tradition with my friends.

Patriots were really far behind and this guy was an annoyance constantly making hand signatures and grunting whenever the refs would make ""a wrong call"". We are roughly down to 5 minutes of the first half and Patriots are behind with 20-25 points and this guy goes out to get some drinks before the halftime show. As he goes away I prepare my revenge.

He had locked his seat so he could jump down instead of going around. I however had noticed this and decided to unlock his seat so it would go back and forwards whenever you move in the seat. He comes back with a very big cola and as he steps into his seat he gets surprised about it not being locked, he trips and spills his drink all over himself while me, my friends and a good chunk of the cinema burst out laughing.

He ends up leaving, presumably to go get cleaned up, however he never returned, which I figure was due to his team losing badly.

Well for people who remember Patriots overcame a 25 points deficit and managed to win in the biggest Super Bowl comeback in history and this guy missed it all because he had to spill drinks on a seat he didn't even pay for in the first place. 

I ended up feeling like an asshole but at the same time it felt so good after having to sit on a soaking seat for almost 5 hours.

Anyway, I'm in a local LGBTQ+ WhatsApp group and we talk about many different issues, so I tried to talk about my concerns.

I immediately get blasted by a guy who tells me that I ""should have more respect because dysphoria and similar issues can't be self-diagnosed"" and that he ""got diagnosed with them by professionals"".

That made me feel kinda bad, because I was just trying to open up about my personal experience with a group I thought I could trust and that could relate with me, nothing else.

input: we're both 24 and been together for 2 years, and I just got promoted to a very stressful role in software sales in July and the amount of stress of having to hit targets/quotas per quarter is insane and it was giving me crazy anxiety and making me really sad. I've been feeling this way since I got into the software sales industry out of college because of having to hit quotas but now with the promotion its even more stress. But the thing is that I hold it all in from my GF, family and friends and I sometimes just cry in the shower. I don't want to seem weak to my GF and complain about my job to my parents so I just deal with it, but its been fucking me up mentally so badly. 

I started seeing a therapist in December and its been helping a good amount, I've made some good progress and she has experience working with people dealing with high amounts of work stress. I get reminded of my appts, which are once a week for 1 hour by text message 24 hours in advance and on Sunday mid day my GF was over and I got the text reminder about my appt on monday at 4. My GF saw this and googled the name of the therapist and found everything out, when I was in the shower and when I got out she was furious for not telling her anything and going behind her back seeing a therapist and she was yelling at me a lot saying how could I keep this from her and calling me an ass for hiding it. I just broke down crying and apologized a lot saying I didn't know how to tell her but I was going to one day. She's been very dry and mad at me since and wants to take a break.

she didn’t take it very well, and is now ignoring me whenever she sees me. i’ve gotten mixed reactions from my friends about ending it too, saying i should have just gone through with it if i actually loved her. others are proud of me for ending if for both me and my ex’s sake. i’m feeling guilty about it, even though i found out she had been cheating on me with one of my best friends (who didn’t know we were still dating and apologized a ton) while she dated me.

input: Okay, so I, a 13-year-old, work small jobs for money. Rake some leaves for a neighbour for 5 dollars, mow the lawn for another 5. Really simple jobs that give me some money to buy what I want. So we were at the mall, and I wander off with 10 dollars and went to Subway. I buy a simple Meatball Marinara for 6.00, and some chips for a dollar. With 3 dollars left, I decided to save them and go to find my mom who is sitting in the playground area with my brother sitting right next to her. I promptly sat myself next to her, and began to eat my food. My brother started whining about how he was hungry, so I instinctively went and handed him my bag of chips. But; this didn't satisfy him. He started CRYING about how he wanted a sandwich.

Now; my brother REFUSES to eat any sandwich other than the Turkey Italiano Melt(T.I.M), which is 6.75. I only had 3 dollars. 

Now, the wining PISSED my mom off. (Keep in mind this is my biological mom, who I see a few times a year. I have a way better stepmom)  She DEMANDED I buy him a sandwich. I explain he only eats the T.I.M, and I didn't have the money for it. Angrily she hands me about 5 dollars, and I take my brother to buy it. I'm staying at her house for the weekend (right now im in the closet because its the only place I can get away from both of them. Its a small house, and me and my brother share a room here.) and shes actually pissed at me for not being able to buy my brother a sandwich even though it was my own money I earned??? AITA???

Now complete the following example-
input: So some backstory, in my English class we are studying a text by a Nigerian women, it's basically a collection of short stories with there own characters focused around the lives on women in Africa during certain events.

We where given the essay topic

""Jumping monkey hill highlights the pressures women are placed under at the hands of men"".

I chose to do the thing that every other teacher at my school recommends and agree/disagree not completely either. So I said that yes it does show that but it also shows how men can be placed under that same pressure. (As it does, it's about a group of people at a writing conference (men and women) and the old man running it is a pedophile who harras some of the women, the story rather clearly shows the men feel pressure not to say any thing as the man can provide them with opportunity. (Very clear).

I got my essay back and the teacher *corrected* my intention to be that women as supposed to what I originally said ""jumping monkey hill explores how women are pressured by those around them, however it also highlights that men can face the same pressure""

She ""corrected"" it to not include the bit about men. 

When she came over and asked me (and the rest of the table) if we had any questions about our feedback. I in no uncertain way said that I think she's wrong, and that the point of a contention is to state your interpretation, my interpretation was that and she has no right to edit that contention if it's completely related to the essay topic as it was. 

Everyone at my table seemed to think I was being rude and sexist for pointing that out.... 

This was a practise essay but I just got the three options for our assessed essay and all three focus exclusively on women (although the story does explore things like religion, race, war, politics, immigrants and so much else) even things that could super easily be multi gender she's chosen to say only happen to women. 

Am I the asshole for choosing to disagree with these topics all going along how women are the victims ect ect.

*I'm not sexism I believe in just testing everyone the same, if gender isn't needed to make a point (and imo the only time it is is when talking about physical differences) I just don't think you should make things about gender, if she was doing the same thing about men my response would be the same.*

input: I have been a long-time lurker on my main account but created a throwaway to post because I don't know if my GF uses Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

This happened during break, and it's really been weighing on me. 

A few days ago, my GF and I had planned to hang out, but the day of, she said she couldn't make it because she needed to help a family member move.

We are kind of long-distance couple: I only come back home on the weekends, so hanging out is tricky for us. She also hangs out with her friends on the weekends as well and not during the week. (This comes up later in the story).

This wasn't the first time this had happened; it happened once three months back as well but she said that she was with a family member atm. So I was kind of upset that this had happened twice in a row, so I told her how I felt. We don't really have that many chances to hang out because of my weekend constraint, and most times when I try to set up a date, she's been busy. However, she hangs out with her friends on the weekends once or twice a month. We've planned out three dates, and have only been on one.

During our conversation, I also brought up how we had only hung out once during our entire relationship (5 months now), but she had hung out with her friends 3 times in the past two weeks. After that, she's been distant, and this morning, she told me that she was upset that I brought her friends into the conversation.

I felt like I was trying to make a point that she wasn't spending as much time with me, but AITA for bringing it up? Am I just jealous?

I will clarify if you guys need additional info.

input: About two weeks ago, I decided to try going vegan. I didn’t eat a lot of meat before so it wasn’t a hard change for me. I can’t tell you why I decided to go completely vegan all together. It’s just something I wanted to try so I did it. And I really enjoyed it. I’m having a lot of fun planning creative meals and buying interesting produce. I also like the way my body feels. I no longer feel heavy or bloated after meals. 

My boyfriend and I are both 25 and we have been together for six and a half years, and living together for five of those. He is a serious carnivore. When I chose to change my diet, I tried my best for it not to affect him. I made him steaks and chicken to “supplement” my dinners. I bought him regular cows milk and regular butter. If he doesn’t want to go vegan, I understand and I won’t make him.  

Last night we went to dinner at one of our favorite bars and he wanted to stop for ice cream at his favorite place on the way home. I suggested that we stop at the grocery store instead (same parking lot) so that I could get some dairy-free ice cream instead. He did it, but it the most passive aggressive way possible. He glared at me and stormed off as I was trying to pick out what flavor I wanted. It was frustrating, but I just tried to brush it off. When we got home, he went to the garage to work on his boat and then went to bed without me. (Granted, he is exhausted from three weeks work with no breaks) 

This morning I sensed he was still upset and I asked him about it. He said he couldn’t understand my diet change and it was upsetting him. He didn’t want me to do this forever and he would be embarrassed to tell his friends and family. He said it would be okay if I were just vegetarian but vegan is too much. 

I did do this without talking to him about it first, but if I had talked to him first I feel like he would have tried to talk me out of it. I also don’t know if I’m going to do this forever, but I also can’t give an end date... 

AITA for going vegan without consulting my boyfriend? 

TL;DR: I went vegan and I liked it. My carnivorous boyfriend is now embarrassed of me and gets upset when I eat.

When he’s on and I’m on at the same time, we’ll usually play something together with a few other friends. 

Question:

Sometimes I’ll be doing something like playing a different game, practicing guitar, or hanging out and watching T.V and he’ll be like, “wow always gotta do what you want to do, and not anything I want to do”. Kind of makes me feel bad. My question here is, should I be dropping everything to play with him whenever he wants? We used to play different genres a while back, but I got bored and returned to our main game. Other than that, I rarely really like to play other games, because we have different interests, and I thought I don’t really domineer his choices with mine at all. If it’s a game I enjoy and I’m not doing anything, I’ll hop on. If it’s not, I might depending on the game and if I’m not busy. Recently I think I’m in this mindset where, if i want to play something then I’ll get on it, and if he doesn’t want to then cool, that’s fine. People have different interests. AITA?

My dad has been in and out of jail and I rarely have got to see him or have a relationship. 

I'd like to have some photos but my mom won't let me even take any of her photos to a Walgreens Photo Center to get them copied. 

I understood when I was a minor that if it was her rule that I did not have my own photos of him for whatever reason then I had to listen even if I thought it was weird (they're ""her photos"" was and is always what she says. I can look at them in photo albums but can't have any of my own copies), but now I am adult and I think it is unreasonable that she not let me have photos of my dad because seriously wtf? 

Basically what I want to do is temporarily steal the photos and just get them coppied myself without her permission. I know stealing is wrong and you can't just take people's stuff and do whatever you want with it because you feel entitled to... But I feel really really entitled to this? Is my entitlement justified enough to break this general rule?

Now complete the following example-
input: Before I start, here's a quick apology for my somewhat poor English. ( It isn't my native language.)

First some backstory: Whenever our school schedules match up, I ride back home with one or two friends. Let's call them girl A and boy B. I am good friends with both of them, but they despise eachother. Most of the time I flip a coin and decide who of the two I go home with. Today it was girl A, she asked me to meet up with her at the lockers after the sixth hours and from there on go home. She didn't show up and thus I biked home with boy B.

Turns out the girl quickly grabbed her and her boyfriend's coat so they could quickly get away without anyone else noticing. But I asked some other friends and they told me she was already gone.

But girl A just so happens to live somewhere on my way home. Me and boy B were having a laugh  and thought of a 'prank' we could pull on her. The prank was moving her, locked, bike and then slowly send her more and more pictures of the bike eventually revealing it's location. Turns out her bike was in the garage but her boyfriends was still on the driveway. So we took his bike instead.

We sent a picture of the bike every 30 minutes or so, but it turned out none of the two looked at their phone the 3+ hours they were together. ( or they just didn't open our messaged idk) Next day we told them about what we thought was a funny thing to do. But they got really pissed at us. I told them it was just a joke and there were no bad feelings or anything. But alas they were still annoyed. I asked her how long they looked for the bike and she replied with: 'idk, my mom looked for it.'

It's now another day later and they're still pissed at us. I really don't think it's that bad of a prank to pull and they don't really have any reason to be upset since they didn't even search for it themselves. This might al be my misguided opinion, hence I'm writing this post.

So reddit please help me out, AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: Hey there! Thanks, first of all, thank you for taking the time to read this.

&amp;#x200B;

I was in a Long Distance Relationship with this cute girl from the opposite hemisphere for 4 years and a half, we talked every day for hours at an end, I helped her through some really awful times in her life as well through some very suicidal months, likewise, she helped me through some awful times of mine.

She suffers from some mental illnesses and she was taking medication for that as well as some other things, I encouraged her on anti-depressants due to her family situation, where she was not abused, but one of her parents is terminally ill and she cares for them.

Recently before the break up, I had been busy due to being close to graduation from the military academy, but I still did my best to be with her despite everything and we were happy, until she started to grow distant more and more, being depressed for seemingly no reason, and spending less time with me. I was devastated, but tried to understand her and still was there with her, I had bought an airplane ticket to go visit her, and so it was set, I logged onto my computer to tell her I had requested leave for a while, and had bought a ticket to go visit her.

That day, before I could even tell her, she  dumped me with a massive text wall that was unlike her writing at all,  claiming she was just not attracted to me anymore, trust me - you know somebody's writing style after 4 years of chatting with somebody over voice and text, and acted extremely could, although we stayed ""best friends"" since we both cared for each other

I burned the ticket in a fit of emotion, which sucked in hindsight, I could have at least gone sightseeing or something.

A little less than two weeks later, she told me she has got a new group of partners (We were monogamous, although she flirted with the idea of being poly once) and spoke to me about them, they seemed extremely manipulative at times and not very attached to her, she introduced me to them a few times through multiple opportunities, and they were quite harsh and respectful of me.

Her entire family, she told me, is around ""15 or more"" people, she isn't even sure, but she claimed to be happy, from what little we speak, she seems to be growing erratic and I'm concerned she might have been encouraged by them to go off her meds or something.

&amp;#x200B;

So reddit, AITA for all of this? I can't help but feel bad for being unable to let go of her or something, and maybe that I'm just paranoid over her new partners or something.

During the movie we occasionally laughed at the funny scenes and kissed a bit during the romantic scenes. After the movie ended we were about to leave, then the husband of the family gets up and approaches us. He says ""You guys need to shut the f*** up"". Mind you his daughters were there too maybe 9-12 yrs old. And literally walks away. My girlfriend and I were shocked and didn't say a word. During the movie this man did not even ask us to be quiet. Later we walked into the lobby and the man is just staring at us. The wife later makes a comment and says ""my daughters behavior was better than yours"". We both just walked away and did not want to escalate the situation. Later me and my gf just talked about it for a bit. Although she didn't seem too bothered I thought that it kinda ruined the mood the rest of the date. AITA in this situation?

input: My wife and I are going through some shit, that's not the issue. 

We have an agreement that when she went out with friends she'd be allowed to make out with guys/girls and have fun. There's only a few rules involved: 1) don't be stupid and put yourself in unsafe situations, 2) must be one and done, no repeats 3) don't forget you have a husband.

So she came home one night after going out with friends, and everything was fine, until she called me another guy's name mid sex.

Then I find out she's continued to Snapchat him.

I asked for one of two things to happen. 1) that she cut all ties with him, or 2) tell him she's married. Both of which she refused to do on the basis that ""he's not from here and I'll never *see* him again"" I lost my cool and the argument ensued where I was told I was overreacting.

AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: I (28F) have a number of friends who are on a particular fad diet. They've had great experiences and like to talk about that with our larger friend group, myself included. I have no inclination to try this diet, but I'm happy that my friends are happy.

I am on the thicker side so I've dealt with people making passive aggressive comments about diets my whole life. Enough people have outright told me I need to diet so much that I've developed a sensitivity to any talk of diets, thinking they might be a comment on my weight.

I am healthy and am happy with my weight, but this wasn't always the case. I was diagnosed with EDNOS (catchall term for eating disorders that aren't anorexia/bulimia) when I was younger, and I'm currently working with my therapist to manage my mental health as I take care of myself physically. One of the steps for this has been focusing on overall health over exact weight, and I don't actually know how much I weigh know since I've avoided a scale for so long. I feel better than I did a few years ago, so to me, that's good enough.

However, when one of my friends says things like ""I can't eat this, I only have 20 carbs left for the day"" or ""\[Mutual friend\] is doing well, she says she lost 3 pounds last week"", I go to a bad mental place. If this comes up while we're eating, I'll immediately stop. I feel sick and feel an overwhelming urge to harm myself to get rid of my excess weight.

WIBTA if I asked my friends to stop talking about this diet around me, especially the parts with numbers? I'm afraid of it seeming like jealousy (and on some level I wonder if I am just jealous) but it's hurting me to hear it.

Now complete the following example-
input: I met this friend online 2 years ago, hit it off immediately like we were long lost sisters, I love her but we're the same person almost down to a T, both dealing with mental health issues as well as physical. We naturally bonded and talked almost everyday, got into a huge fight where I was admittedly the asshole for blowing up on her and a mutual friend, eventually we made up and last year we started talking again. My friend (who I'll call A for convenience) sometimes mentioned a guy, but we didn't talk about that too much since she's really reserved about her personal life, which I understand, but sometimes get a bit offended with since I'm super open about my personal problems (like I'm being now I guess). 

&amp;#x200B;

One day her ex hit me up on twitter. I'd tweeted something about MBTI and he loves that thing so we talked the entire night about that. I mentioned her bc she also liked MBTI and he said he should send her his regards since they hadn't talked in a while and that he missed her, and I didn't think much of it (this will be relevant later). It appeared to me he was a bit flirty and I have to admit he ticked some of my boxes - he's incredibly well-spoken (which at my age is rare) and has a weird sense of humor, a bit of dad jokes mixed in with dark humor, not to mention liking some of my favorite movies and anime. It was a pleasant night of talking, nothing happened because I had an idea there'd been something going on between him and A and didn't want to stick my foot in that. Also I wasn't so incredibly attracted to him that I'd risk a friendship over that (well, guess what!)

&amp;#x200B;

I was a bit conflicted and told our mutual friend that T (her ex) had hit me up and that I'd enjoyed talking to him. I asked if  I should tell A, since I didn't want to go behind her back, especially since we were on good terms now. My friend said I should say something just to get it off my mind, so I did. A has the weirdest reaction ever, like she was clapping at a really elaborate comedy shtick which just left me kind of dumbfounded. She laughed super hard about it and I decided to play along, told her that we didn't talk about much of anything. A asked if I'd mentioned her. I said yes, because of MBTI, and said he'd told me he missed her and was going to hit her up. She said that wasn't possible, since she'd blocked him a year ago... I just thought that was weird and didn't think much of it, but she kept talking about how manipulative he was and how he was such a disgusting person who ruined her life and manipulated her for years to his benefit. I was starting to lean toward him being an asshole. But then I kept talking to him and he was always super nice to me; a superficial kind of nice, but nice nonetheless. From a rational point of view, he hadn't done anything to me, so why should I hate him? 

&amp;#x200B;

We kept talking but not for long. I guess the combination of A talking shit about him with me and him being aware that we knew each other and we talked made for a weird atmosphere. I don't regret it much, but I like being on good terms with people. We didn't stop talking because of what A said about him, just there wasn't much interest on my part (he kept replying to my instagram stories and complimenting me, so I guess he was a bit attracted but I can't say for sure). 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, A was never open about what happened between them, despite my insistence. I insist because I don't want to hate someone just from what my friends say; while I understand sometimes they are right to be mad, I also think there are always two sides to the story, and so I'm usually skeptical, even when they tell me the whole story. I hate being unfair to people just because someone pretty much ordered me to, which is kind of what happened. She started to become increasingly paranoid about me and him, asking if we were talking much and what we were talking about. A bit of backstory: T and A had known each other for some 4 years I think and they dated for two weeks. They never met in real life, he was an asshole to her, pretty much manipulating a naive girl into sending him nudes and being there for him while he went around flirting with other girls. I KNOW he was shitty, which is why I didn't want to get very involved with him, but I also didn't want to be outright a bitch (or a white knight I guess). 

&amp;#x200B;

So one day T says ""hey we need to talk"", and I get a bit scared. He says I probably know that it's about A. He tells me he tried to talk to her, which I know because she showed me: he was super casual saying he missed her and she basically told him to fuck off and that she never wants him in her life again, saying how after they broke up he'd hit on her best friend and now he was doing the same thing to me just to get to her. Well, I don't want to be the one to say it but IT DID GET TO HER. I sent a print of the ""hey we need to talk"" bit to the group chat I had with A and our mutual friend. I had stuff to do so didn't deliver (also bc I was nervous about A's reaction since he'd pretty much trash talked her to me after the initial message). A asked ""where's the rest? can you send the prints?"" and I kept postponing it until she lost it and pretty much bullied me into showing her the convo. I said I didn't want to because it was going to hurt her, and she said she had the right to be hurt. I almost had a panic attack bc she wouldn't stop blowing up my phone. Before you say it, yes I know I messed up here and it was natural that she wanted to see the prints, but I told her what he'd said in them (albeit in a much nicer way since T was really a bitch to her). She wouldn't stop pressuring me to give her the damn convo, so I said fuck it, if you want to let your ex who you dated for 2 weeks affect you this much then be my fucking guest. Btw I tried to defend her in the prints, saying I understood why she blocked him and didn't want to talk to him. I wasn't SUPER WHITE KNIGHTE-Y about it, because I wanted to hear his side. Yes, the side of an abuser, I know I know. So after she saw the prints she said she didn't want to talk to me again about T or anything for a while and left the group chat. I didn't go after her, but I went into a panic that night, talking to my best friends trying to understand what exactly had happened. She usually insisted I show her my convos with him, meanwhile I never showed him any convos with her... Because he just didn't care. Now if you ask me, A has a great boyfriend now so I really don't understand how this affects her so much. I've also never had a boyfriend, but I have talked to my share of almost-boyfriends online, so I know how to spot a manipulative asshole and cut them right off. A didn't and she suffered for it. I suffered the first time, then I learned to get over it. 

&amp;#x200B;

To sum up, A tried to talk to me again for a while, but I accidentally mentioned his name twice and she said she couldn't do it anymore so she left mid-conversation. I think she overreacted a lot, especially for someone who seemed to be so close to me. Btw I haven't talked to T since November when all of this stuff happened. Now I know how much of an asshole he is, but only because another friend who knew him told me since she wouldn't open up about it. A wished me a merry xmas to which I replied ""merry xmas to you too, but when are you going to reply to me?"". Took her some 10 days to reiterate that she was offended and couldn't understand how I could do that to her, and that maybe we really weren't compatible after all. She might be right...

&amp;#x200B;

So, reddit, am I the asshole for not taking her at her word and talking to him regardless? (Or also, am I the asshole for taking printscreens and posting them to the group chat? Actually I am, and I know that one, so don't mention it, I've learned my lesson.)

M wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

Now complete the following example-
input: On Monday I woke up at 5:30 AM and noticed my phone was not charging. Immediately went to go see if my charger was plugged in, and smelt something burning. Turns out, my charger was melting and my pillow was smoking, which I assume means I was minutes away from a devastating electrical fire. All is well, and the situation was handled. 

My mother happened to text me later in the day and asked me how I’m doing. I said well, and then told her about what happened to me. She said that she’s glad I’m okay, and followed up with several questions about what I’m going to do about the situation (alert my building/landlord, charge my phone elsewhere, etc.). 

After we had settled those things l, I communicated to her that I felt lucky and that I must have good karma. She followed it up with, “that, and I pray for you everyday 😘”

Now, for a bit of back story. She raised me catholic, and both of us have hit a series of crossroads with our faith. I’m soon to be 24, and have decided over the past 2 years that I’m definitely an atheist. Being raised in that environment, it always seemed like I could never mention that, so I attended church silently and never said anything about it despite my deep down feeling that it’s all bullshit. 

She got remarried in 2010, and is incredibly involved in her church community. She is no longer Catholic, she just “reads her bible and tries to love people.”

She’s aware that I think religion is crap, however she refuses to have a conversation with me about it. Despite these facts, she continues to drop off comments like the one above, which I interpret as a deliberate attempt to have me force the conversation. 

Well, I wasn’t in a very good mood so I replied and told her that in a religion where being humble and modest are virtues, it’s incredibly arrogant to think that **your** prayers saved my ass from being turnt to ashes, as well as communicating that I can tell it bothers her that I don’t believe in God.

Needless to say, it didn’t go over that well and she didn’t reply to me after I accused her of trying to bait me into a conversation about it endlessly.

Reddit, do I need to apologize, and AITA for calling her arrogant?

input: My gf decided to drive to a trivia night at a local bar and was not going to drink so she could drive home. 

As sometimes happens to us all, she ended up drinking and could not drive home. I received a call whilst in my car asking me to come and pick her and her car up and drive her home. 

I said no, because I would have to drive home, get an Uber out to the bar (20 mins away), it was late and I had just finished work. 

I immediately offered to come pick her up. I would always do that, no questions asked, no matter where she is, to ensure that she is safe. But she refused saying she didn’t want to go back to the bar in the morning to pick up her car. 

I said that is what I was offering, take it or leave it. And that she got herself in that situation because she shouldn’t have driven if she was going to drink. 

She called me an asshole. Am I?

Now complete the following example-
input: I live in an apartment building in downtown Philly. I've lived here for more than five years so I'm used to city life and I don't expect it to be quiet. I'm used to the sounds of traffic, sirens, and drunk assholes shouting outside (mostly on the weekends) but a 24-hour convenience store and sandwich shop recently opened up right across the street from where I live and the level of drunk shouting and screaming has gone through the fucking roof. It's really bad, you guys.



Packs of drunk assholes chanting Eagles chants at the top of their lungs for twenty minutes at a time and getting in the street, blocking traffic, making drivers trying to go past lay on their horns at two am is something I can handle on weekends because I don't have to work but its EVERY GODDAMN NIGHT and it's killing me.



Sure my apartment is in a somewhat busy area but it was relatively peaceful until that convenience store came in and attracted all of the people who left bars at closing drunk off their ass but who don't want to go home yet. I tried looking up the non-emergency police number but that number is basically only open during regular day/office hours. And I don't see what my apartment management or the convenience store can do about it because these people are technically not in the store when their screaming at the top of their goddamn lungs in the middle of the street.



What I want to do is fill up a bunch of water balloons and keep them in a bowl in my fridge so they're nice and cold and throw them at the shouting people to try to get them to stop. Even if it doesn't get them to stop entirely, I have to think it would make them leave the area at least. I would only do this if it's past 1 am mon-thurs and I would use those mini balloons so no one gets soaked or anything, I don't want to damage anyone's property or anything, just give them a splash of cold water as kind of a friendly 'shut the *fuck* up, mofo'. I just honestly have no idea what else I can do to change the situation that will actually enact some form of change.



So if this is an asshole move, let me know but also let me know what else if anything I can do, I'm seriously at my wit's end.

input: My 4th hour science class is my least favorite class. I always feel like I’m an outsider from the pre established groups of students. My opinion is never taken into account when looking at things that involve me. The biggest example of this is when the entire class had an debate on how to pronounce my name and no one listened to me pronounce my name. So flash forward to Friday December 7th. My birthday is on Saturday December 8th. So during the last five minutes of class my teacher reminded us about my birthday. So the entire class attempted to sing happy birthday. I finally had enough when I heard the many ways people attempted to pronounce my name. I grabbed my things and walked out of the classroom.  I know I should have asked to use my pressure pass but I was just thinking in the heat of the moment. The entire song felt like nobody was being genuine and just wanted to get through the day. In fact that was the only time anyone mentioned my birthday for the rest of the day. I still wonder if my actions were valid at the time or should I apologize to everyone for walking out.

Now complete the following example-
input: Okay so context! My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.

Fast forward to last week when he lets me know that it’s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i’m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he’s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i’m now aware that he’s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that’s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.

Now here’s the big issue. I’ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It’s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it’s just plain weird to me. I’ve cried about it all week because I can’t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.

I tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn’t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don’t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it’s something I need to deal with on my own. It’s killing our relationship because he now says I should’ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.

Am I the asshole?

input: To start this off, I will go ahead and say the other person is definitely not the asshole in this situation. The person I made the joke to, a friend of mine, had lost her mom a few months ago and I made the mistake, but I still feel like an asshole for it because of her reaction.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, I was hanging out with a group of friends and we all went out to dinner. At some point or another, the person I had accidentally made this joke to asked me some question, I don't remember what they said, but I responded with ""your mom."" The second it came out of my mouth, I processed what I was saying and who I said it to, and automatically apologized, but she was reasonably pissed off and sad due to her situation. I don't really expect her to forgive me or anything, but it would be great. I don't know really what I could do further to make it any better, but I just don't want to hurt her too much, you know?

input: I'm in an LGBTQ organization for students at my college. There's someone in an officer position that's been a terrible person to most of our officer base.  This is a completely unpaid student organization. This will not impact anyone's livelihood. 

Context: 
-They are the only straight officer and they're known for making super inappropriate jokes about race and sexuality. When confronted they refuse to apologize, and continue making jokes at our expense.
- They blew up on the group chat one night calling an officer a bitch for asking why they were opening the conversation aggressively. At the meeting they called us to because of this they said we ignored them when they brought up issues, but every time they did it was as a joke.
- On multiple occasions this person has spoken to our members and told them that other officers don't deserve their positions 
-Some of us are physically threatened by them and it's to the point where we dont want to bring up issues. 

They have never apologised for anything they've done. When we being up serious issues to this straight person who's thrown slurs at someone and tells our officer base that we ""look too queer to talk to administration"", all we get is ""oh okay"" or ""alright"".
This person claims that they will try harder but theres been no change and recently they jumped way over our heads to start talking to some people outside of the school without our permission.

I want to talk to a member of the organization to see if they'd run against this person at our upcoming election. The dude technically does their job but they make everyone super uncomfortable and multiple people want to quit because of their presence.

Now complete the following example-
input: My youngest brother is 12, doesn’t have a phone due to losing everything and just not being responsible in general. Everyday at 2:30pm I pick him up from school and every other day I take him to and pick him up from karate 5-6pm. My parents insist I do this because they are either at work or just got home from work when he needs rides. My other brother works from 3-6 after school and can’t give him rides either. The thing is his school is 0.7 miles from our house and karate is 0.2!! Literally down a block and a half from our house. My mom insists he needs rides because it’s too cold and night, and he used to have a big instrument from school but he doesn’t anymore and definitely can walk. 

Yesterday was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Ever since I started picking him up, a year ago, he never looks for my car. If I’m not right up front, he waits around where I generally can’t see him, then walks home. His school is BUSY and I have come and park 15-20minutes early just so he sees my car. If I have to park across the street he won’t even look. Once I drove in circles trying to get him to notice and even yelled out the window and he just kept walking. 
This happens way too often. Yesterday I waited 25 minutes just to get a call that he walked home from karate. This was the 2nd time in a row this happened. I was only 2 cars from the entrance (parked facing it so maybe only 25ft or less) but a truck blocked my view and I could not see if he was there. 

When I got home I was livid, I pay for my own gas and I waste SO much just driving to get him for no reason. And in the winter I leave my car on so I don’t freeze, making me waste even more gas. I told my parents I’m not giving him rides anymore, he can walk. They went on and on about how they can’t give him rides and it’s not a big deal. They didn’t even tell him to look for my car, they said it wasn’t his fault. I just don’t understand how many times can this happen before he looks for my car for once. He’s not an idiot but wow I get so mad because he can’t get simple stuff like this in his head. 

When I got home later that night I was told he was upset and it’s my fault. I didn’t even talk to him, I just told my parents I’m done with this ridiculous and not giving rides anymore. Apparently he overheard and is upset because I was being a jerk??  

Anyway today my mom went to pick him up, GUESS WHAT HE DIDNT LOOK FOR HER. And she ended up just leaving and he walked home. She said he can walk now but is still mad at me for not giving him rides??? 

TLDR; my brother walks home when I try to give him rides because he doesn’t look for my car, but I’m the jerk for not wanting to waste my time/money anymore.

input: I don’t like my parents bugging me so much about my grades. Maybe if they weren’t always so pushy about it, possibly I’d actually care about my grades. Now, not saying my grades are bad, but like, I don’t like them constantly checking my grades. Isn’t a progress report every 6 weeks plenty? Thing is, my dad sorta works at the HS I go to.

Yeah.

It’s incredibly irritating to me, and I don’t like my parents getting involved in it, simply as I’m a rather reserved person. I’m strict about people touching my phone. I don’t like people on my laptop. Etc.

Now complete the following example-
input: Background: a young mother was murdered last year in my town (Ohio). The husband was arrested shortly after. Their 3 year old son was given to his closest relatives, the family of the husband.
The woman's sister lived in Turkey, and was originally from Isreal. She filed for a Visa to come to the funeral, but was denied. After 7 months, she was allowed a Visa to try and get custody of the nephew, as she feels he should not live with that side of the family. She said she would immigrate to the US, as she wouldn't want to force the child to relocate. The husband's family refuses to let her see the kid, and a legal battle is brewing.

Potential A-holism: A guy on my Facebook, someone whom I've known casually for about 7 years, often posts anti-immigrant, ""the media is the enemy"" things. He posts how the sister from Turkey has changed her FB status to ""living in (our town)"" and that this ""is how illegal immigrants sneak in, and how terrorists get their start.""

This post got to me, as someone who works at a newspaper covering the story, so I explained how she was here legally, and how she's seeking residency because she wants to take care of her nephew.
He called me a liar, accused me of falling for the media conspiracy (and told someone else to ""do what they can""to remain vigilant against liars), and said I was being racist for thinking he called her a terrorist ""just because she's Arabic."" At that point, he revealed he's the brother of the accused murderer, and the child is his nephew.

I apologized for not knowing, but still maintained that he can cry ""illegal immigrant"" all he wants, but ""terrorist"" went too far.

AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: This happened a year ago but now that I found this sub I'm curious to see what people think.

So last Christmas, my parents got me concert tickets. I was really excited about it. They got me two. I mentioned this to my friend, Ellie, just in a ""Oh my parents' got me this great gift!"" kind of way and she immediately started squealing, all excited that \*we\* were going to a concert. I didn't really correct her- the concert was not for another couple months, and it was very likely that I would invite her, but I hadn't then. Ellie comes from a LOT of money, and is pretty entitled with a lot of things. She once threw out a manual can opener because she wanted an electric one and ""manual can openers are for poor people"". Yes. Really. 

However, here's where I think I effed up. My parents got me two tickets. Ellie, assuming I would of course take her, asked if I could buy an additional 2 tickets so that her fiance and the guy I was talking to could come. I pushed back, said I didn't want to plan so far out, that I was just getting to know the guy I was talking to, that I didn't want to risk it. The tickets were expensive. After more back and forth, I did buy the tickets. Ellie was very much under the impression that I was taking her and I was definitely not correcting her, again because there was a good chance I would've taken Ellie and her fiance had everything stayed as it was. Also important to note, Ellie picked me up a bottle of wine at some point at my request. When I went to pay her for it, she declined and said something about how it was her concert ticket payment. I assumed she was joking, the bottle of wine was maybe $15 and her and her fiance's tickets combined were over $200. 

Anyways, like I said, I likely would have taken Ellie to the concert had things stayed the same. But they didn't. She started blowing off my texts and calls, and our plans in general. We made plans to go get lunch after classes one day, and she was going to pick me up from campus. It was raining. I waited for her for 20 minutes before she texted me and said she wasn't coming after all. Whenever I tried to talk to her about it, she would tell me she was busy and that I couldn't understand because my major was ""basically basket weaving"". If it matters, she is a nursing major and I am political science. My closest friend is an engineering major, and my other good friend is biology and pre-med, I totally understand when they don't have time for me, but I do expect the common courtesy of ""hey, I'm not going to be able to make it"" instead of just not showing up. 

Any time we did talk, she had something cruel to say about my other friends, the guys I liked, the clothes I wore. Hanging out with guys made me a whore, and the guy I liked wasn't good looking enough, and I was giving people the wrong idea by drinking at bars. That kind of stuff. I wound up blocking her and her fiance from viewing my social media because whenever they did, it opened the door for them to be critical. 

So with the concert coming up, I hadn't seen Ellie or had a pleasant nonconfrontational conversation with her in several months. The guy I liked had broken things off. So I went with three close guy friends of mine. Ellie \*\*freaked\*\* out. Her text to follow:

 ""You literally were such a weasel about this whole situation I didn't even want to have a conversation with you about it bc I would rip your head off and I've been so busy I haven't wanted to get worked up about it.  Do I need to just draw it out step by step? Bc obviously humanities has drained all your neurons.

A: you gave away the tickets without even asking which is a weasel move. If you wanted to just give them away bc we haven't been hanging out then you could have just told me before hand and had the consideration to alert me

B: even tho I only bought you 1 bottle of wine and have all the money in the world it was rude as shit for you not to offer to pay me back considering I bought it for you in exchange for a ticket and had gotten you another already 

C: the fact you made it look like you weren't going to the concert yourself and that you gave away all the tickets but actually you just sold the ones that me and (fiance) were going to use"" 

It got uglier after that, I eventually cut her and her fiance both out of my life. I've never felt I was in the wrong but I'm curious what other people think. To be totally clear, I paid for/was gifted all four tickets. The closest thing to payment Ellie gave me was a $15 bottle of wine. I didn't even know about the second one, if that matters, because I thought who the hell would think that is an equal tradeoff. And I have no idea why she was under the impression I wasn't going to the concert myself. I never said anything to that effect. I think probably because she figured out I'd taken her and her fiance off my social media, but that happened weeks prior. 

\*\*TL;DR:\*\* Made loose promises to take friend and her fiance to a concert, she started to act like kind of a crappy friend so I took other people, she FREAKED out. AITA?

So like i know that we arent really together or whatever (her words or not really because any discussion about where we are just ends with her telling me she doesnt want to talk about it), but it hurt me to see that regardless. 

Ive been trying to not be jealous or make comments and also trying not to go crazy when i dont see her all week, but i cant help but be hurt.

My friends suggested that i should do the same and try and move on. The thing is, I still want to try and make it work and i hate just casually dating its pointless as far as im concerned, but it does help me nkt be crazy and jealous in regards to her. So i went on a site and made a profile but i cant help but feel slimey and shitty. 

I really dont know of its good advice or if i should just give up because i feel like after a little over a year its worth fighting for still but i dont want to be the only one fighting even though shes the one who came and got me back... 
So AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm a junior in college, my sister is a senior in high school.

&amp;#x200B;

I got home from school for winter break on Sunday. My sister was out when I got home, so I didn't see her, and I ended up going to bed before she got back. Monday, she left for school before I woke up, so I didn't see her then either, nor did I see her that evening because she was working (note that I have not left my house since I got here). During this time, I didn't hear from her at all - the last meaningful communication I had with her was a couple weeks ago, when she texted asking if my boyfriend would buy weed for her friend group. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this afternoon. I am at home alone (entire family is at work/school) when I hear someone *pounding* on the window of our front door. It's my sister and her boyfriend, who just pulled up after leaving school early. This is the first time I have seen her since I got home. I let them in and say, ""Dude, where's your house key? You freaked me out."" My sister responds aggressively, ""I *left* it in my *room.*"" I try to make some half-assed joke about her driving around with out a house key on her key ring, which prompts her to yell ""*SUCK MY FUCKING DICK, OKAY?*"" immediately before going upstairs to her room.

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say, I have been in a bit of a shit mood since then, as it really hurt my feelings that my little sister does not apparently care at all about seeing me for the first time in months. She asked me why I seemed so ""grumpy"" as I was cleaning up the kitchen after dinner, and I explained to her that I was mad that she has either been ignoring me or actively being mean to me. She responded by going off on me for not being understanding of her busy schedule, saying that I could not have possibly expected her to say hi to me last night when she got home from work because she needed to go to bed (she got home at 9:30 PM and, while I do not know exactly what happened, I really doubt that she went straight to bed). I rolled my eyes at that, but said okay, and she once again immediately stormed off to her room after yelling, ""You can roll your eyes all you want but you're still a dick!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

So AITA for calling her out and saying that she upset me? Or for my reaction to her excuse? Or for not saying hi to her when I first opened the door? She's clearly pissed at me but I really feel like she has zero reason to be mad, especially when it seems to me that she was the dick in the first place. Enlighten me, please!

Now complete the following example-
input: A little of a backstory. I'm 31 non-native english speaker, have a 8 yo daughter, who lives with her mother. I have helped raise her, tho, been at her house, and all that, so I've been a part in her education/manners. Also, she spends every saturday with me.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago, a friend of mine from school got in touch with me via Facebook (we were classmates and good friends in school, but after graduation we went our separate ways). She tells me she moved back to town, she's got a kid (6 yo), got married, got divorced (husband cheated on her) and stuff. Since we've got kids who are around the same age, maybe we could meet up and the kids could play while we catch up. Sounds OK to me and my kid agrees, so we do.

&amp;#x200B;

They came to our house and they get along, playing until it's time to eat (tea time). So we are eating, and suddenly this kid farts. I look at him, and so does his mom, but we don't say anything. The kid then rips another one. My daughter looks at me kinda shocked, and the kid starts laughing and lets another one out. I look at my friend and she just looks me back and says ""kids will be kids"". So I look at the kid and say ""you shouldn't fart on the table, kid"" in my friendly-yet-firm dad voice.

&amp;#x200B;

He doesn't respond and starts eating his sandwich. He eats with his mouth open, talks while eating, and I can notice my daughter is annoyed. Suddenly, the kid farts again and starts laughing (again, mouth full with his sandwich bite.)

&amp;#x200B;

I got annoyed. He's 6, but he should at least apologize. So I tell him ""Hey, \[blank\], you shouldn't eat with your mouth open. And if you're gonna fart, at least apologize. I know farts can sound funny but we are eating. It's not polite."" His mom tells him to listen to me, and he kinda does (he still eats with his mouth half open, but no more farts.)

&amp;#x200B;

We finish eating and the kids go back to play, only my daughter now doesn't want to play with him. She asks if she can play with my phone, and the kid wants to play smash bros (wii U) so I put him against the CPU. Eventually, they have to leave. They live close so we walk. We let them at their house and everything seems normal, except is mom was silent the whole walk.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got tome, I text her saying my daughter and I got home safely. She texts me back a ""that's nice"" and then proceeds to tell me she liked the visit but was kinda annoyed of me lecturing her kid. That she get's it not the best behaviour but I should have overlooked it, and that the kid said he would like to come by again to play but didn't like me ""acting like a dad"". I tell her that I get her point, but in my house, and in my table, we behave, and that at no moment was I rude or harsh to her kid, I was acting mainly because my daughter showed concern. She responds that's ok, but to remember that ""kids are kids"". My daughter said she liked playing with him but ""didn't like him while eating"" (her words)

&amp;#x200B;

So, AITA here?

input: This happened a few hours ago and I'm still confused. TL;DR at the end.  


So my mate posts a picture to a group chat of him using a filter to look like some K-Pop star or something. Neither of us like K-Pop (I moderate an Anti K-Pop sub because I really hate it.) and we do stuff like that all the time to take the piss. Someone in the chat really likes K-Pop. I didn't think about that before replying ""Literally Disgusting"". Oh boy did I make a mistake. It really kicked off in the group chat with this person's friend having a go at me for ""making fun of something x is really passionate about."" I get told repeatedly to back off, but I didn't. Now I wasn't being stubborn just to be a jerk. Person x is the kind of person who will make fun of people 24/7 but can't take it themself. I'd had enough of them not having anything in the way of kickback for their shitty attitude and decided that if they were going to swing at me, I'd swing back. So anyway, after an hour or so of arguing and half a dozen people who weren't in the group chat messaging me about how person x was ""really pissed off"" it eventually dies down. Now I'm getting the cold shoulder from everyone in the chat bar my mate who just thinks its hilarious. I'm pissed off that person x is seen as a saint even though they just take the piss 24/7 without any kickback whatsoever, but when I decide to have a go at them I'm suddenly a terrible person. Oh and also I'm getting the whole snapchat story of ""why do I bother"". Does this make me the asshole?

TL;DR: I didn't back down from an argument because the other person can't take someone taking the piss out of them but does it to everyone else.

input: An acquaintance of mine recently got married and had a college mascot at his wedding. This isn't some small college either. This is a college that any football fan, even casual ones, would be familiar with. Everyone at the wedding thought it was cool, but I think it makes you seem like a douche. Even people who weren't at the wedding think it's neat that the mascot was there. From what I've gathered, the person who got married is friends with the person who is the mascot, and they asked them to do it. To me, it seems like a move to show that they are better than everyone else. Like shouting ""Oh, you can't have a college mascot at your wedding? You must be poor."" The kids parents are really good people, but the kid is definitely the type to show his ""status"" as ""wealthy."" Hint: they aren't wealthy, their parents are. I hope this is enough info to be judged.

Now complete the following example-
input: To preface: I'm a guy, 17. My friend, X, is 18.   


So I've been friends with this X for about three years, but we don't see very much of each other because she dropped out of high-school at the beginning of the year, about six months after she enrolled at my school. We've hung out a couple times, and once she brought one of her friends with. I was fine with this, and we all went to the theme park together. Now, X doesn't live at home anymore - teenage grievances with her mother, who I'm on good terms with. Her mother, takes buys these tickets for us, partly because she just wants to see her daughter more often, and because she wants to make sure she's got some friends like me - the kind my grandmother would call ""the good sort.""  


So the theme park was fun and all, but her X's friend is kind of upset that I'm there, and she thinks I'm a bit of a downer since I didn't want to smoke. She kind of put a dampener on the night to be honest. All in all, however, it was fun and I talked to X about how she was going and all that, gave her some advice and went home, but I didn't really like her friend.  


We decided to hang out tonight at Timezone, and we've got plans to get some food and just walk the city - it's Schoolies time here on the Gold Coast, with all the year 12 kids who've finished school drinking and partying, among other things.  


She texts me, about half an hour ago, and asks if she could bring ""J"".  
So I explain to her that when she brings her friends I kinda feel like a third wheel, you know? She says she understands and it's okay, because he's just gonna play some games.  


I tell her I'm not sure, and ask who he is.  


""Ahaha my boyfriend."" ^(oh boy)  


Now, I know what some of you are thinking - I admit that I \*do\* like her, but I don't really think she's the right girl for me. ^(That's all I've got to say about that.)  


I tell her that I think I'm gonna give it a miss, but she says that he won't come then.  
I tell her not to let me stop you, and to have fun.  


I think that she's now under the impression that I want to be more serious with her, you know? I just think that it would be like before if she was bringing a friend, and it would be even worse if it was her boyfriend.

input: I’m currently a graduate student in an engineering program in America. I share an office with another grad student whose from a different country. She recently received a message on LinkedIn from a recruiter for a rather large computer/tech company advertising a few openings in there manufacture sector for chemical engineers. Due to being from another country and English as her third language, she had me help her draft all her emails to this recruiter and fill out the prescreening questionnaire and actual application. After she submitted all this info she showed me the job listing because she was worried she didn’t meet one of the qualifications.

Here’s where the WIBTA comes in. I scribbled down the listing number and looked it up later. Not only do I meet all the requirements, most of them I meet to a T. It’s basically my dream job, they’re literally hiring people to work on the process I’m writing my thesis on. Would I be the asshole if I applied for this job? 

I’m almost sure I’d get it over her. I’m defending 5 months before she is, and it’s a time priority hire. My skill set is also more aligned, she doesn’t meet one of the 5 listed qualifications, a programming background. She’s also international and has not begun applying for any form of permanent work visa or anything, where as being a citizen I can work with no restrictions. The real kicker is, the one thing she didn’t take my advice on is the expected salary range. She wrote 95k with a 10% bonus and relocation costs, for a job that pays on average 72k with 6% bonus. If I apply I’d use a much more reasonable salary range, most likely boosting my chances.

So WIBTA if I apply for the same job as my lab mate, a job I only found out about by helping her fill out her application?

&amp;#x200B;

I(f26) used to have a friend(f24) for years, I had previously felt somewhat uncomfortable.

I remember living with a boy who was my boyfriend for a short time, I invited her to the house and when I finished with him I realized that they became friends, I didnt give importance to that.

A couple of months ago I divorced my husband(m31) and I realized that the same thing happened, even though she knew the reason why I divorced him (he was unfaithful,cheat on me, and he was very manipulative) I warned her that to be careful since he was going to try to contact or add people that known  me to continue stalking

Recently (my fault for snooping) I saw that they became friends by instagram and she liked all her post.

I got upset and bothered, I wrote to her asking her what was going on and she told me that nothing, that I only have to worry about my life, I felt something betrayed because I thought she was my friend.

then she sent me screenshot where she talks with him (so i could see that nothing was happening) and in a part of the conversation she says ""you seem to be a very good boy, you dont seem to be what she tells me about you ..."" She also send her voice messages

Then, today, in the morning, I wrote to her and told her to dont talk to me anymore, and I blocked her.

input: My family has had a system for as long as I can remember that works as follows: 

On a communal device, one can limit the current user's turn to 30 more minutes by giving a warning.

My brother is now refusing to follow this system, going so far as to lie and state that the communal device is his personal PC.

I do have a personal PC, but the crux of the argument is that this communal PC is the only one with a VR system hooked up and the only one that could have one hooked up to it due to space constraints. 

Admittedly I'm not totally blameless: his argument is that he's playing with a friend who has a 2 hour limited timespan, however I gave the warning coincidentally 30 minutes before they got on. Rather than give me my 30 minutes immediately and then explaining the situation, he chose to play solo for that 30 minutes and THEN complain when I returned to claim my turn. He then proceeded to argue for a full hour claiming that he had an inherent right to use my *personal* PC to play his game. During this tine, I could have gotten my half hour and then he'd have the entire remaining timespan to play with his friend. Despite this, he has refused to admit his own lack of foresight so I'm settling this once and for all: AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: This is probably going to be a long one.

I'm a commercial cleaner, I absolutely love my job, it was perfect up until last Thursday. I work on a team with my best friend (Jay), and my boyfriend (Dee), how could it get any better right? Jay has been a close friend for about 6 years and I have been seriously dating Dee for 9 months now.

We drive to 6 accounts on Thursdays, since my car has been down a little over a month now, Dee has been picking us (Jay and I) up from our house. Obviously Jay and I live together and Dee lives about 20mins away from us. 

Here is where it gets interesting, my boyfriend has a decent car, the outside could use some TLC but the interior is immaculate. Dee is a genius when it comes to wiring, so as well as having an awesome sound system he also has the video display up front and we can watch movies on the way to our accounts. 

Jay has been struggling a bit with his alcoholism, he doesn't always drink on the job but occasionally he does, I dont judge as long as you get your work done, keep the liquor out of the accounts, and of course dont break anything. He has worked the better part of the last 6 months with no issues so I had no issue. 

This day though I could see signs that he had a little too much, and I told him, you're cut off from this point. He wasn't happy but obliged, or so I thought. 

Jay asked my boyfriend for his car keys so he could fetch a cleaner we forgot to grab from the car, goes outside and is unseen for 10 minutes, I go out and he is still in the car looking for the cleaner... it was on the floor where we told him it was. In the same back seat he was just sitting in, but for some reason he is sitting in the front driver seat. 

Fast forward to us finishing up the account and leaving, I am the last out because I have alarms to set. I get in the car and see my boyfriend pick up a cigarette that had been set on the dashboard after probably 2 hits and burned down to the filter... We both look at the dash to see a nasty melted gouge. Dee asked Jay if he was smoking in the front seat of the car... No was the response he got. We both look at the cigarette and sure enough Marlboro on the filter, (Dee smokes Newports and I dont smoke at all) Jay smokes marlboros. He asked again, this isn't your MARLBORO cigarette that burned up on my dash? Again no. 
At this point Dee is so angry he asks Jay to get out the car and ride with another team member to our last account. Jay exits and we sit for a second to take in the situation. 

Dee is furious, I get it, he is trying to sell his car, the interior had no damage up until this point. I try talking him down and eventually he does, although he does not want my friend back in his vehicle without an apology or the cash to replace the dash. Not so unreasonable, well Jay decides he is going to avoid Dee, I get it, Dee is pissed. 

Fast forward again, time to go, I was under the impression my other team member would take Jay home, he had messaged me on fb and said he would either ask or uber home. Come to find out he walked an hour and a half home despite the options he had. To add to this he posted on snapchat about how he has to walk home because people are ""childish"" and ""petty"". I am pissed when I find this out, because I find out later from my boss and another coworker. 

When Dee and I leave I saw Jay had left his food in the car...or rather in my boyfriend's daughter's car seat directly, and the plate on the floor, I try to hastily clean it up but no, Dee saw it and he came to the back seat to look for more, and starts pulling empty marlboro packs, Naked juice bottles, wadded up paper towel used to clean up some kind of red spill and more garbage from under the seat. These are obvi from my best friend because as I have said before neither of us smoke Marlboros and I know my boyfriend doesn't drink Naked. At this point there is nothing I can do to make Dee reconsider Jay riding with him.

Now I have Jay telling me over Facebook messages that he will make his own way to work. 

Ok then.

On Friday we started a brand new account, so both of my bosses as well as the regional leader is with us. I get to work with Dee and my boss asks where Jay is, I told her what he told me, he was making his own way, then I hear about the snapchat posts, personally I dont use snap but when I was shown the snaps I wanted to snap. My boss calls him and he states we just left him. Now I'm really pissed. My boss leaves to go get him and I tuck my anger down for a later conversation with my best friend. 

Unfortunately we had no time to hash things out right away so I figured at the next account we would sit down and talk. No dice, he asks my boss to take him BACK home, completely behind my back, to the point that I didnt know he was leaving until I got to the next account. I message him asking why he would do this, he tells me he's not getting in between me and my boyfriend, I told him this is not the case, there is nothing I can do for him concerning Dee and his car and how he should've come to him as a man and apologize. Jay goes on about how important Dee is to me and how this isn't my problem and he will do what he has to do from this point. I said yeah Dee is important to me, but so are you so man tf up and talk to this man before he decides he doesn't want an apology anymore.

The whole weekend goes by and Jay says nothing to me, we live in the same house yet had no interaction, so when today rolls around I do what I always do, get my things together and wait for Dee to call me and say he is here. When I leave I see Jay's room has no light and did not see him elsewhere in the house so I assumed he was already gone and leave. Minutes after leaving, I get a text saying how he wanted to apologize and how could we just leave him behind...

This is where I snapped, I told him straight up that I didnt even know he was in the house and if he really wanted to apologize to Dee he would've either asked me for his contact info over the weekend or been on point watching for him to pull into the driveway. Personally if it were me and my job on the line I wouldn't have bothered with shoes I would've gotten out there to speak my peace. He gets sassy with me about his walk home, and I told him he walked home because he wanted to, he could've just as easily apologized or asked the other team member (she was actually pissed he didn't ask her). I told him straight up that his priorities were screwed up and he needs to grow up and take responsibility for his choices, and that people aren't going to wait around to hold his hand through things. 

Then I started in on his snapchat posts I was getting hounded about by our office gossips who were trying to get all the juicy details of the story...

I asked him if Dee was petty for bringing him to work everyday without asking for gas money or even getting a thank you in return, yes he comes for me because I'm his girlfriend but in all reality he doesn't have to bring my friend too. Was my boyfriend petty every time he made pit stops so you could get your cigarettes or liquor, or take you to the store? I got no answers to this question, so I told him I wasn't going to be a member of his pity party. He states he didn't want a pity party, and I told him obvi you want pity cause you asked for it all over snapchat where our co workers can see and continue to message me about. 

I'm not sorry for telling him to grow up and be a man (hes 32) but I do wonder if I am an asshole in this.

input: My girlfriend and i were getting ready to go to the grocery store and our 16 month old daughter is playing with her baby alive. We kept trying to get shoes on her feet but she'd wiggle away to go back to her toy. Eventually i get tired of the back and forth so i take the toy and tell her she can have it back when we get back home. My daughter doesnt know very many words but she loves to back talk and give attitude, so shes fussing at ne for taking her toy and i say ""i dont care, you can have it back when we get home"". I thought i was being perfectly normal until my girlfriend starts getting mad at ne telling me not to say ""i dont care"" to our daughter. This completely blew my mind as ive been saying it and ive never gotten this kind of reaction. I ask why I cant say ""i dont care"" and her response is ""look it up"". I personally am not a fan of ""going with the flow"" especially when it comes to parenting, it just feels to me like one of those things where you just gotta do it how you do it because thats the beauty of it. 
I honestly feel like i didnt do anything wrong and shes just overreacting, but im here to ask. 

Am i the asshole here?

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm M18 and moved in with my dad and stepmom back in November. This is going to need a bit of background though I think before I start.

My dad has always been a drug user, from very heavy stuff back in the day to now only weed and alcohol. He's aggressive and abusive but also caring. Very narcissistic and outright stupid sometimes, but also smart and logical other times. He's very unpredictable but he's always been kind to me. My mom's side of the family, who I've spent most of my life with, all dislike him greatly. I've always defended him as much as I can, but I definitely understand and agree with them, to a degree.

Like I said above, my dad is unpredictable. An accurate metaphor would be a sparkplug. Since November, he's gotten progressively worse and worse, consistently yelling at my stepmom and myself for the dumbest things, like not putting enough creamer in his coffee or no mustard on a sandwich. This is seriously the things he gets so mad about, he has to leave for several hours and come back that night and ""apologize"". My stepmom and I discuss him frequently when he's gone and we have no idea what to do. He doesn't have a job, except from Uber-ing occasionally, and my stepmom works 40+ hour weeks at a restaurant to support us. I help out as much as I can with my financial aid, mostly by paying certain bills or just taking care of myself and taking that burden off of them.

My dad is still kind to me, but it feels a bit backhanded. He bought me an expensive game (AC Odyssey Gold Edition) for Christmas, which is awesome, and he buys the food I like and treats me with respect, but he also kicked in my door because I was struggling with my counselors to get a schedule at college. He fixed it afterwards and apologized, and we talked about it all. The next morning though, he barges in my room at 7 in the morning and yells at me for the exact same thing, despite having an understanding the previous day!

Recently I've just stayed in my room and kept it locked. I go out and get food when he leaves, and I talk very minimally to him. I feel like I can't do anything in this house without getting yelled at or even potentially hit. I always hear him yelling through the walls. He gets mad I don't talk to him and spend time with him, but what am I supposed to do? As a result I barely eat and sleep and live in constant anxiety about what he's gonna do next.

Am I the asshole Reddit? I don't know at this point. I feel justified in not giving him the satisfaction of being a dick and still getting what he wants (time with me). But I also feel really awful because he does a lot for me and doesn't ask much in return (unless he's being a massive prick). So please, let me know.

I had to reformat this post, so some details might be missing. I don't really have any other place to go, or if I do move, I wouldn't have the privacy and freedoms I do here (like having to sleep on a couch).

Now complete the following example-
input: So basically I have an old truck I have been wanting to sell for a while because it’s diesel and I can’t deal with all the problems as a teenager right now. My parents told me they would be fine with me selling it and buying a new truck as long as I understand they still own it. So I put it up for sale and a guy wants to trade me this really nice truck in great condition because he wants a diesel, and our appraisals are almost the same and I love the look of his truck and it’s gas and I’m very good condition. 

We chatted for a while and I sent him all the stuff about my truck and he sent me all his stuff and we agreed on trading this weekend. I told my parents about it and my dad keeps blowing it off and saying he is having second thoughts and wants to research some stuff before selling the truck.

Now, this is what my dad ALWAYS does when he’s not interested in me doing something. He just keeps trying to blow it off until hopefully I forget about it. So now I am set up to trade trucks with this guy and he is keeping it from other sales for me and my dad is telling me no now after he clearly told me yes earlier.

So this is my question: am I an asshole if I cancel this deal after I told the guy I would this weekend and he cancelled other offers with people? Or is my dad being the asshole for not letting me sell it after saying I could at any time?

input: When she followed it in the past she went through my followers (don’t know why) and found a girl I admittedly used to flirt with. I did unfollow her but didn’t appreciate the drama of my girlfriend.

Fast forward to the last week, she (my girlfriend) asked my if she could follow my instagram again and I refused, telling her I don’t want the drama because she’ll go through my followers or something like that again and nitpick. 

We fell out over this and spoke again tonight and she said she feels as if I’m hiding something, but I’m not, I really just don’t want her looking at who I follow. She can’t understand this and says it’s a deal breaker for her. 

I feel as if she prioritises her friends online over me and she brought this up saying I don’t prioritise her or her feelings if she isn’t allowed to follow any of my social media and call her a drama queen for being upset that she isn’t allowed to. I said that’s untrue. It’s not a big deal at all. She said she understands that it’s ‘just social media’ but the fact that I outright refuse to let her follow me is strange. I disagree.

input:    So my friend was getting her hair done from a hairstylist, (she does her business at her house) Since she didn't want to be alone she asked me to come over. Me and my sister came and went inside. About 3 minutes later she starts asking me if I was from Africa. I was like...""yeah why?"" 

Then she starts a lecture about how I was suppose to greet her since it's a common courtesy in Africa. At this point it gets very awkward...because she looked angry and thought I was rude for not greeting her when I came in. Which I would admit...I was in the wrong, but the fact that she had to point it out made everything really uncomfortable for me, and she kept looking at me from before and I didn't know why..i guess it was because she was waiting for me to say ""hello"" or something and so when I didn't...she felt like she had to point it out. 

Normally in my culture, if I was the one at home, I was suppose to greet the guest that CAME to my house. I don't know why she couldn't just greet me and welcomed me to her house instead...

Now complete the following example-
input: Another post has me wondering. Lately the only way my kid will stay quiet and still for diaper changes is if I let him hold my phone playing kids’ music and sing along. This is fine at home, and if I’m sick to death of Victor Vito and Freddie Vasco eating their burritos up and down the west coast, I can change him on the floor and deal with squirmy worm for a few minutes. In public, he’s tried to climb off changing tables multiple times in the last week, and when he isn’t trying to crawl off the edge he’s trying to pull to stand or he’s screaming his head off because diaper changes are the worst thing that’s ever happened to him.

FWIW, I’m not a bad singer so long as I stay in my chest voice - a bad asthma flare left me with chronic cough, some airway scarring, and a really gnarly transition to head voice. The music he likes is all well within my range, and we rarely make it through more than two two minute songs. I know he can throw my phone, I have a heavy duty case and I’m pretty confident it can take it. If I don’t sing along and dance and make silly faces, or if I just sing alone without letting him hold the phone or without playing music, we’re right back to attempting suicide by four foot headfirst plunge onto tile.

Now complete the following example-
input: Where I live, one is legally permitted to bike on the sidewalk as long as you yield to pedestrians. Whilst biking, I use bike or car lanes most of the time, but if I have to make a left turn using a crosswalk and I end up on the wrong side of the road, I'll usually stay on the sidewalk until I hit another crosswalk and I can get on the right side again.

This was the case today, and the sidewalk I was going down was relatively narrow (I would say double-file, give or take). I saw a dude walking towards me with his kid and his dog, so I moved as far right as I could and slowed down (there was enough room for us to pass each other). He continued to walk straight down the middle of the sidewalk, and when he got close enough that I stopped completely, he pointed at the bike lane next to us (going down the wrong side of the road) and said in a condescending tone ""You know, they have the bike lanes for a reason"" or something to that effect. I didn't really know what to do with this so I just said ""OK"" and started pedaling again. He then proceeded past me and kicked my back wheel decently hard.

I'm relatively sure he wasn't justified, but was there anything I could or should have done differently in the situation?

Now complete the following example-
input: So pretty much the title.
I (21M) am in college, and my friend is a 19M. For context, he lacks social awareness often can be irritating at times, but I know he means well.
Basically, he has crippling anxiety all the time and constantly needs validation for every choice he makes. I’m talking topics where no one else could possibly know better than himself, and yet he never trusts his own instinct. 
I’ve tried helping him by simply giving someone to talk to, however this is mentally exhausting. He’ll essentially say something bad about himself(often true), and want the other person to give him reassurance that it is not true.
 I’ve tried giving him validation to ease his nerves, but I honestly now feel like I am feeding a bad cycle by doing this.
As of now I simply avoid talking to him in most cases, as I feel like he needs to learn how to trust his own instincts for himself, and to stop needing validation from others.

What do you guys think? Should I be there for him and give him someone to talk to, avoid him and let him figure things out for himself, or do you think another option would be best?

Now complete the following example-
input: Hi folks.  A small confession, this isn't really worrying me or anything, but when I found out about this sub a couple of days ago I LOVED the idea.  (Am I the asshole for not posting a serious situation?  Lol.)    So anyway, I finally came up with a situation which I could share.  Happened about a year ago.

I live in Spain now and my first year here I met a young Spanish guy about my age in a club that we both attended.  I was visiting from another town.  We became quick friends and used to have deep life discussions and stuff.  Before each of us had girlfriends, we would hang out every 3-4 months.  I would always hop on a bus or whatever and go meet him where he lives (Seville), he would put me up in his house and I would pay for our meals.  

Well, once we got girlfriends, things started to peter out, but we maintained contact more or less.  One day, we had planned to meet up, and I made my usual travel arrangements.  At the last minute he bails on me because he ""isn't in a good space mentally"" (to my knowledge he has no diagnosed mental health issues, he was just feeling down or whatever).  I tried convincing him but hey, whatever, he doesn't feel well.  Fine.  I cancelled all my travel arrangements and didn't think too much about it.

About 6 months later we tried again.  When we agreed upon my visit I asked him, are you SURE this is what you want?  Because last time you bailed.  He said yes.  I confirmed with him, AGAIN, 1 week before my visit - again making SURE he wanted me to visit.  He says yes.  And finally, a couple days later, he calls and I already know what it's about.  He says, can I please NOT come because it turns out this is the only weekend he can be at his flat alone with his girlfriend.  I made a big deal about it this time, like, dude, you've done this TWICE now and I confirmed with you two times before making my arrangements.  You're gonna make me do this again?  And, he did.  I had to cancel all my arrangements, losing time, energy, and a bit of money.

After that moment I pretty much decided, hey, this guy has no respect for what's going on with me and is too wrapped up in his own crap to be a good friend for me.  So I was sad at ""losing him"" but I stopped talking to him.  Just didn't feel like he had anything to add to my life.  

It's not like we were super close, and this is totally platonic BTW, but we definitely had a strong friendship.  Not my BFF but probably (one of my) BFF(s) in this new country.

For whatever reason I finally called him today, told him that what he did wasn't OK with me, but that I didn't want to argue and just hoped he was well and all.  And that we should stay in touch.

So, AITA / WITA for pretty much cutting him out of my life for a whole year over this?

Note: He also did not try to re-establish contact with me in this period.

Now complete the following example-
input: TL;DR at the end.

So it's Friday night. SO and I are playing video games when he gets a call at 9:30pm from a work friend who lives one street over, asking if we want to go over to his house to drink and hang out with some other friends.

I'm really not in the mood to go over there. I take medication every night for nausea and it doubles as a sleeping pill. I'd already taken this medication, plus I'm in my pajamas, about ready for bed. I told him he should go without me and that i was going to bed instead.

As he's leaving, I tell him not to do anything with any girls. He has never done anything with another woman as long as he's been with me, so I have no reason to think that he would tonight. I was mostly joking, but I'm also feeling a little self conscious. I'm in my second trimester of pregnancy, so I've started to get a little bit of a bump, plus I'm not pooping regularly and I'm extra gassy today. I just feel really unattractive and my anxiety brain was telling me he might think this as well. He obviously didnt find my comment funny, however.

Cut to about 10 minutes after he left. I'm in bed, getting settled in, and I hear glass breaking. I automatically imagine someone watching my SO leave and, thinking the house is empty, break in through a window. I jump up to lock the bedroom door and immediately call my SO, asking if he was in the house because I heard glass shatter. He didnt even seem phased by this, from what I could tell. He tells me he'll walk back and for me to get his gun by our bed. 

While I'm waiting for him to get back, I start to realize a couple things. 1.) We have a dog who barks if he hears anything strange at night. He w as s suspiciously quiet. 2.) The shattering noise definitely wasnt loud enough to be something big, like a window breaking. I started to feel pretty stupid right as my husband walks into the apartment.

He clears the house and doesn't see anyone, so I go to check the living room. Yup. Our dog licked a bowl off the coffee table and it shattered. He *never* does this, but the table was pulled a little closer to the couch tonight, so I guess he took his chance.

As we're cleaning up the mess, my SO says ""there aren't even any girls there!"" I was sincerely confused by this, so he explains that the only women at the party are there with their husbands. The way he says all this to me, I can tell that he thinks I broke the bowl so that he would have to come home. I told him, ""I didnt do this so you would have to come back!"" But he just muttered something that didnt make sense and then left for the party again. Didnt seem like he was in a great mood.

I do feel pretty stupid about not checking the house to actually see if someone was breaking in, but was I really being that big of an asshole to put him in a bad mood like this?

TL;DR: SO went to a party while I stayed home and I told him not to do anything with any women there, even though i have no reason to say this. After he leaves, I think I hear someone breaking into the apartment, so I call him home to check. After finding out it was just our dog, he thinks I tricked him into coming home and leaves again in a bad mood.

Yesterday he (Tom) met his GF and a friend of her (lets call her Bettie) in a local Burger King. Everything startet off pretty chill they talked a bit and everything was fine. Bettie weighs about 110kg ( 242 lbs)  and is about 170 cm (5' 7). Bettie ate a muffind and the GF ate something else and they asked Tom if he wants to eat something too. He said the doesnt feel like eating now because he feels fat (he isnt overweight). After he said that, Betties mood changed a lot and she was pretty offended and after she was offended his GF was also not so happy. They didnt talk that much afterwards and half an hour later everybody went home.  
Tom went home with his GF and they had a fight about what he said and she thinks he is an Asshole, he and i think he is not.

input: So this is all so stupid, but it started an argument and I can’t tell if I’m being unreasonable.  

At noon my boyfriend and I were hungry.  I was craving Taco Bell and he wanted 5 guys.  I offered to go pick them up.  I got our meals and came back.  I handed him his receipt.  He didn’t really get it so I asked him to pay me back.  


He asked me if I was serious.  He then went on about how he pays for all our dates and nights out and has never asked for a dime.  Which is true, but to me that’s different.  Those are times that he is taking me out.  Furthermore if he had ever asked me to split the bill I would have gladly, he just always picks up the check.   That’s his choice.  

Another thing is that he makes a lot more money than I do.  $20 for him is a lot different than $20 for me.  He ended up giving me the money, but now he’s being moody and not talking to me besides one word answers.

Now complete the following example-
input: The dog is not a therapy dog, just a friendly lab. According to my 4yo niece, the dog is at the preschool everyday. 

And don't get me wrong, I love dogs...I just love kids more. 

My 3yo nephews had a pretty severe athsma attack shortly after I picked him up from preschool last week following a coughing episode at the daycare. This is a typical allergic reaction for him and he's been hospitalized in the past.

My sister reminded the preschool owner that her son is allergic to dogs and the preschool/dog owner told my sister that she keeps the dog away from my nephew. She then changed the suject and called my sister out for my forgetting to sign the kids out when I picked them up.

Keeping the pet allergens away from my nephew when the dog is there all the time just doesn't seem possible. Not to mention the little guy LOVES dogs and will do anything to get close to one.

The athsma attack scared me to death and I don't think the owner is looking out for the health and safety of my nephew. WIBTA for calling in an anonymous tip about the dog? Are there any other options? 

Finding another daycare/preschool for my sisters three kids is not an option at this time. My sister is afraid that if we call the health department then the owner will find a way to kick her out and she will lose her job.

Now complete the following example-
input: Okay, so a little backstory. I suffer from anxiety and depression, and over the last year or so it's gotten considerably worse. About three months ago everything became too much and I took an overdose. One of my roommates found me and I was really out of it but still conscious - I had thrown up quite a bit. They called an ambulance, and we waited. 

I don't remember much but I recently found out that they rang some people for advice &amp; they were told i was being inconsiderate as one of them had an assignment due tomorrow and they were still working on it. She told me that while waiting for the ambulance I was complaining about being in pain while she tried to work on the project &amp; it bothered her. 

What really bothers me is that when the ambulance came, neither of my roommates came to the hospital with me so I was left alone on a hospital gurney for hours with no one. 

At the time I didn't think about it much, but i'm feeling really low again at the moment and my anxiety keeps bringing my mind back to this and I just kinda feel like shit about it all. I know i shouldn't expect them to drop everything for me &amp; it's not about that. I just feel really hurt and like i was (and am) nothing but an inconvenience. This isn't a pity party attempt - i want an honest opinion to try and figure out of I have a right to be upset or if it's my anxiety/depression making me feel like this. thanks.

Now complete the following example-
input: My family has always had 2 or 3 dogs at a time. I love dogs, and they usually like me back. If they don't, or if they seem to be only tolerating me, I leave them alone. But all of my dogs have either warmed up to me or been friendly from the start. I feel like I have only met one truly mean dog, and it wasn't her fault; she had been trained to be a ""fighting"" dog, and even she settled in and became friendly. But our new dog is something else.

I'm not even paying rent, so I don't think I get a vote as to whether or not we have new pets, but I did ask to wait for a while. Two out of our three dogs died of old age last year. It hit me hard, and I miss them like mad. My father brought home a 1-year-old yellow lab about 1-2 weeks ago.

This dog hates me and only me. For the first week, I gave him the benefit of the doubt, because he's moved to a new home and is certainly scared. He's loosened up around my parents and our other dog. He's friendly and even cuddly at times - to everyone else. I have been nothing but gentle toward him, but he can't stand me. He snarls and growls at me when I move. He barks every time I - and only I - open a door or use the stairs. Most terrifying: he seeks me out, growling, then starts barking and advancing when he sees me.

I am shorter than my parents and significantly smaller. If I were attacked, I would not win the fight. He genuinely scares me. At first, I tried speaking in a friendly/calm voice while giving him space, the same way that my parents did. This has worked for them. It has not worked with me; when they aren't home, he ""guards"" the bottom of the staircase and threatens me when I appear. His old home didn't have any stairs, so I tried staying downstairs all night with him. When my parents are downstairs, he jumps up beside them and lies down. With me, he moves to the other room, then growls and barks whenever I make noise or move around.

Honestly, I think it would be okay if he only did these things when I was near him - because then I would just give him space. But he comes looking for me or goes to wherever I am and acts like I'm an intruder. I don't even know how he knows when a door is opened by me as opposed to anyone else, but he only growls when it's me. He especially freaks out any time I use the bathroom, and I have some medical issues that mean I'm in there every 2-4 hours. No one has been able to get a full night's sleep because of the barking. I feel like it has been long enough that he should at least understand that I live here too, because I haven't done anything differently from anyone else!

I don't want to be all ""It's me or the dog."" That's not a fair choice. But I'm constantly on edge. I can't stay if this dog stays. AITA?

input: This is an alt account, for reasons I'll describe in the post/story.

Backstory: I've used Reddit over 2 years now. I almost exclusively use mobile on Android, but I don't know all the facets to the app. I hadn't put serious thought into making an alt until today, as I never saw a need to. This meant my casual-browsing account was also my porn-viewing account, and I didn't have any consistent qualms with this.

Cut to me browsing the Home tab. I'm enjoying the front page when, to my dismay, an untagged NSFW image rolls through. It's explicit enough to make you uncomfortable, if you were to notice this on my screen in public. This isn't the first time I've had this happen, so I go to my typical response. I comment, asking why an NSFW post isn't tagged. Almost always, within an hour or two the post gets properly tagged. I have unfollowed one sub for consistently not tagging posts.

Today, I got a new response. My comment, asking for the post to be properly flagged, received a reply telling me: ""you're on a very NSFW sub. unfollow"". I replied pointing out that the sub asks users to tag their posts if they're NSFW, as well as adding my concerns about casual browsing. That reply received a similar response.

When I posed the situation to a friend, he suggested making an alt account and showed me how easy it is to switch between accounts on mobile. So here's the alt.

Now complete the following example-
input: 5 1/2 years ago I moved by myself across the country. My whole family is still back in my home state. I come from a big family, lots of cousins and we were all very close growing up. Since then things have changed. We all still love each other, but my visits home are short and few. 

Six months ago I got married at a courthouse. I love my husband very much and it was a quick engagement and I guess you could use the word ""eloped""

My mother was understandably shocked and a little upset when I first told her. We're very close and I usually tell her everything. 

She now wants this summer to throw us a wedding celebration with my whole family when we come visit. She wants a band and to have it catered, and my whole family there, the whole deal. I do not want that at all. My family has very traditional expensive weddings. While I respect that and have enjoyed every one that I've attended and been in, that is not my style at all. I'm not one of those ppl that wanted a big party, I just wanted to marry my husband because I love him. I dont need a party to prove that.

My mother really wants this and tbh, the whole thing would make me super uncomfortable. I dont know these extended family members any more and I'm sure they couldn't care less weather I'm married or not. Like I said, my visits are short and not often and I would prefer to spend my time with the people I love and not partying with people i dont know any more. I'd rather hang out with my parents and brother and grandparents.

My husband is indifferent, he said he'd be happy either way. 

This whole party is for my mom, and shes told me that. If she wants a party just throw a BBQ or something. I should also point out that I am her only daughter. My brother is planning on having a traditional wedding though, so it's not like she'll miss out on both her children's wedding. 

I'm in need of some outside perspective, reddit, AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm a freshman in college, and I've known my girlfriend and her family since we were little kids. We both come from super conservative families, so when we first started to like each other we knew that going out was a big no-no. 

We started texting about 3 years ago, and we've gotten to know each other pretty well. We only see each other in church and stuff like that a few days a week, and we would always talk about how we wanted to be together, only us two. But we knew we had to wait a while for that to happen.

Fast forward to September of this year, in her high school schedule she has basically an hour of free time where she can do whatever she wants for lunch. My school is 10 min away so naturally, we were very excited at the prospect of finally having a chance to go out without our parents knowing. We have fun, go to eat, walk in parks, all of the cliche relationship things that we've wanted to do for years. She's the perfect girl for me.

I don't go out with her every day, two times a week she goes out with a friend. Her friend is nice and funny, it doesn't bother me that they hang out. Sometimes, though, my girlfriend says that she can't go out on days that we've agreed we're going to meet because she's going to be with her friend. Also, earlier in the year we would also somtimes skip class to have more time with each other, but we stopped because she didn't want to miss any more classes and she felt bad about it, and I agree with that. However, she repeatedly skips school with her friend even after she told me she doesn't want to skip school anymore. I don't even find out about it unless I see it on social media, she doesn't tell me. 

I've tried talking to her about it, but she says it's not a big deal and not something worth getting mad or annoyed over. And sometimes I think she's right, our relationship is pretty perfect in spite of our circumstances, and maybe I'm the asshole for getting mad at this. But sometimes still, whenver she cancels or skips with her friend, it makes me feel unimportant.

TL;DR: Girlfriend and I finally go out after years of knowing each other, I get mad when she cancels on me or skips school with her friend instead of me.

Now complete the following example-
input: My mother-in-law moved in with us about three months ago. It's been ok. She and I are clashing personalities and cultures, and it's come up more often now that we share a similar space. She is a traditional Hispanic woman with a strong sense of decorum and family hierarchy. I am white, liberal in all ways, and agnostic about most traditions, including and especially the need to obey elders.

Before, out of consideration to my wife and out of a belief in the my ""my house, my rules adage,"" I used to watch what I said around her very carefully because we only visited with her about once a month. But when my spouse asked if she could live with us, I said I was okay with it as long as I no longer had to walk on eggshells around her. My spouse agreed and told their mother that she needs to respect that we do and say things differently in our home than she may like. I don't know how her mother responded to that but it never came up again.

Last week, my 10-year-old and I were chatting while having breakfast while she was in the kitchen. We were goofing around and making bodily function sounds to each other. We are very mature, I know. But when I said, ""I fart in your general direction!"" and made a loud raspberry sound at her (she was giggling like crazy), my mother-in-law slammed down her coffee mug and said, in Spanish, ""Don't you dare teach my granddaughter to be so disrespectful. I will not allow this kind of vulgarity in my home any longer."" And I said, in English (I can understand Spanish but can't speak it well), ""This is my home. You don't get a say in how I interact with my kids, or how any of us speak or act."" She stormed away and now isn't speaking to me.

My spouse says ITA because I embarrassed her in front of our daughter and because I expected her to accept too much, too quickly. They also say that I am being a little culturally insensitive and that I need to respect that abuela will be deeply offended by how I spoke to her, so I need to apologize. But I think it was important for her to see that I will stand up for our interactions/myself and also to stick to what we originally agreed on--that I won't be policed in my own home.

Now complete the following example-
input: A brief background - I have been working in my career since graduating college 5 years ago and have lived comfortably thanks to my hard work. My boyfriend went to college a little later in life and is currently working on getting jobs in his field. Though we live in the same city, being in different places in our lives at the moment has created some conflict, since we can’t necessarily always do the same things.

I have done as much as I can to include him in things that require spending money by offering to cover it (I wanted to have the experiences together), always been understanding when he can't be around because of working odd jobs on weekends to keep his finances stable, those types of things. 

A few of my friends and I decided to take a weekend trip soon to a city no one but I had ever visited. I jumped on this opportunity to be the guide of all our debauchery! I instantly knew I wanted to ask my boyfriend to join. He said he wouldn't be able to because of the cost. I offered to cover it and he accepted. There's been a ton of excitement and chatting surrounding this trip ever since. 

Fast forward to now. I wake up this morning to him telling me that a large group of his friends from college are going to a cabin in the woods near my hometown next weekend and they miss him and want him to go. It's very short notice and would require him to take off of work. 

I know he was super excited getting that text and also rushing to get out the door to work, but as I sit here thinking there are a few things that are bothering me and 2 things that definitely have me hurt. I'm bothered by the fact that he didn't in the moment think to ask me about going or even hint at gauging my interest. I'm also bothered that he would so quickly be okay with not working for a weekend and risk his financial stability - I only say this because he has been very open and talks about his predicament quite a bit. 

What I'm hurt by is that for the last 2 months I have asked him to take off or work later hours on a Sunday (not the whole weekend) to come support me and my sports team during a match. This is a group I have played with year-round for 5 years and they are like family to me. Hasn't made the effort once. Not to mention… next weekend is the season ending championships and our team party, which I clearly expressed I really wanted him to be a part of multiple times. I'm also hurt that after just including him in my experience with my friends, he then went on to contemplate a solo group trip without even making me feel considered. 

The feelings are fresh and I don't think I would do this, but the thought crossed my mind to tell him he isn't welcome on the trip with my friends anymore. I'm not sure if I am right to be so bothered and hurt by this, and I do feel shitty that I've toyed with the idea of cancelling on him.

Now complete the following example-
input: Occasionally, I'll forget minor stuff that is unimportant to me and this makes my wife angry - case in point is tonight when she asked if I knocked her hairspray onto the floor, and spilled some. I assume that she didn't do it (hence why she's asking) so it must have been me. I responded by saying I probably did, but don't remember (It was afterr I worked 9 hours, went to the gym, and had dinner, so I'm pretty tired and was just focused on showering at that point). Apparently this was the wrong answer.

She starts going off about how can I not remember something that happened a few hours ago, and swears I'm lying to her. How it would be implausible that I wouldn't hear it or remember picking it up. Frankly, I didn't and was just trying to be honest. I knock stuff over all the time - it doesn't stick out in my memory. 

First of all, what would be the benefit of me lying? We don't have kids, and the dog can't reach it. If it wasn't her, it was obviously me. The fact is that knocking something over is something that happens all the time. She has stuff on the counter and sometimes I'm not careful about avoiding it if I'm distracted or doing something else. 

Second, if I had remembered or realized at the time, I would have cleaned it up so she wouldn't notice and get pissed later. 

I made these points to her, but she was just busy being mad. I ended up cleaning it up, but she still kept going on about how there must be something wrong with me to not remember it and she was pissed at me for ""lying"" to her. Somehow this also became about me being ""holier than thou"" about her having stuff on the counter (apparently this is what she got from me saying that there is her stuff on the counter sometimes and sometimes I knock it over by accident). 

To me it seems like a huge overreaction. Why couldn't she just accept that I was trying to be honest by saying I don't remember, but I'll clean it up?  What really pisses me off the most is that she doesn't ever seem to think she does anything wrong and seems incapable of apologizing for blowing up on me. I apologize for not remembering and she jus stays pissed, with no admission of fault on her part for the argument.

So, AITA for not having a good enough memory of minor things I screw up?

Now complete the following example-
input:    So we got a new assistant manager at work and he is extremely rude and demanding. He’s a “my way or the highway” type of guy. Personally I get a long with him great(I have to try really hard to stay on his good side). However I do it to keep the peace at work. It’s not the same for my coworkers. He’s made two coworkers cry on different occasions. I noticed him messaging a manager from another store and a nasty message popped up and before he could minimize it I was able to read it. It said something making fun of our store manager. So I was curious and I waited for him to leave his computer unattended then I took it to the back and opened up the messages. I read a ton is extremely in appropriate and rude comments about my coworkers.... so I took photos of the messages and anonymously sent them to HR and CC’d our store manager (who was one of the people he spoke about negatively on the messages). His messages weren’t awful but definitely inappropriate for work. I feel bad because to his face I act really nice and innocent (like I’m on his side) however in reality I was looking for opportunities to “out” him. He is a good person just had a poor attitude and as much as he was being unfair, so we’re all of us. So I understand why he felt so negatively towards everyone. Sure it was inappropriate.... but should I have spoken with him and my store manager first, instead of sending it immediately to HR. Should I have sent in anonymously, and continued pretending as if I knew nothing? So far no action has been taken by HR. My store manager did speak with the 6 of us individually about the messages without revealing what was said. He mostly just asked how we felt about the assistant manager. He definitely spoke with the assistant manager and he is clearly scared he’s going to loose his job (he opened up to me about the situation).

input: I'm fat. Always been fat. Never been athletic. I was a book reading nerd. It happens sometimes. However, I have a good career, my own home, a paid off car, two lovely cats and a fiance of 4 years. He's Mexican. This is important.

I live in Texas and my mom lives in North Carolina. I work in a financial industry and my typical work clothes consist of all black, black slacks, black cardigan or jacket, mostly black blouses and black shoes. Black matches easily, looks professional.

I text my mom daily (I'm an only child and my dad is dead) and she asked to see my outfit that day. I mixed it up with floral print ponte pants, black top, black shoes.

""Colors look so slimming on you! They really hide your problem areas!""

Gee, thanks mom. I told her ""How many times have I had to tell you to not make comments about my weight?""

""well you just isn't know how to take a compliment, that's how I meant it, everyone has problem areas! That's how I take it when someone says that, now tell me something else shitty!""

""I've asked you a dozen times not to make comments about my weight and you never ever ever do""

""I hope you show some respect to your new HISPANIC family unlike me""

She's made comments before and was real excited when trump was screaming about a wall, so I know she would prefer a white guy for me. I've had to tell her a few times to shut up with the racist shit. Doesn't get me anywhere. She also loves my fiance and is always saying he's a handsome hardworking man and treats me like a princess. I don't understand the logic. 

So I hit her back with the ""Yep, you're a racist old bitch! Leave me alone until you can change your attitude.""

Now she's pissy and blowing up my phone for me trying to ruin Christmas, saying it's my fault and I have bad language.

AITA for not just letting her spew her bullshit and telling my mom to fuck off at Christmas? If it was a stranger off the street telling me I had problem areas and making backhanded comments about my ""Hispanic family"" I'd tell them to fuck off too. Did I ruin Christmas?

Now complete the following example-
input: So, for context, on Wednesdays at our school, we have this thing called 8th hour. School lets out 1 hour early, and we have about 1 hour until buses arrive. That one hour is called 8th hour and we can use it to do homework, basically do whatever.

In the morning, my friend asks me if he can play Smash Ultimate against me in the morning(I usually see him in the orchestra room every morning). I said yes, but I got there late and wasn't able to. So I just told him I could play during 8th hour.

So, come 8th hour, and it seems like there's a mock recital for the Solo and Ensemble performers going on in the orchestra room. Friend is still there. The orchestra teacher is giving tips on everything the performers need to fix, etc. So, I was wondering if I could still play on my Switch if this was going on? I saw multiple people on their phones and there were some people talking as well. So, I decided, if I turned the volume down and didn't talk loudly, it would be fine. So, I start the game. We played through one performance. It didn't seem like we had affected the performance in any way, and the orchestra teacher didn't notice as well. No one had called it out either, so I thought we were in the clear. But cue halfway through the second performance(we still hadn't said a word), teacher sees it, gets mad, and confiscates my Switch until the end of 8th hour, meaning I couldn't leave either. I still don't get why it was a major issue, because it had already been about 10 minutes of playing before she confiscated the Switch, and we didn't make any noise, and neither did the Switch. Not only that, she seemed to be okay with people being on their phones. But, I can see where I'd be in the wrong. So, AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: Earlier this year I (25F) hooked up with a guy at a party who’s mutual friends with a lot of my friends. I gave him my number but didn’t hear from him, so I figured he wasn’t interested especially as we were quite drunk.

Several months later after reconnecting at various events we both attended we started seeing each other and have since talked about that first night. He told me one of our friends (F) called him the next day and said that I wasn’t into him and regretted hooking up with him, which wasn’t at all true especially since I hadn’t even spoken to her since the party.

Apparently, she’s done various other kind of creepy things to him that make me think she was into him the whole time and purposely did it to sabotage us. We’ve been friends for years but I feel like she betrayed me especially since she called him literally the next day to tell him that.

I’ve accepted that I can’t trust her anymore and to be honest I’m upset and a bit angry. I feel like I should talk to her but I’m quite non-confrontational and I don’t want to make it a big deal of it in my friend group so I’ve just been avoiding her and not really inviting her to things anymore. I try and stay friendly when we see each other but it makes me feel hypocritical and two faced (an asshole). Also it’s been quite a while since it’s happened and she will definitely just lie about it or deflect so I don’t think its worth it.

Sorry this is all very highschool drama and I’m really not used to it. This is a throwaway btw, thanks for listening :)

TLDR: Friend told guy i wasn't into him behind my back and I feel betrayed. Now I don't want to be friends and am cutting her out

Now complete the following example-
input: I've been talking to this guy for a few weeks and we hit it off immediately. We even had a short coffee date during lunch break, and we were on the same vibe. He was funny, charming, similar sense of humor. Everything went great. I should add that we had sex talks as well, discussing kinks and stuff. 

So we decide to have a real date and then he asks if I'm on birth control. I think a few hours and cancel the date. He was confused saying it's just an innocent question, unlike all the stuff we talked about before. And we were both hinting that we will have sex on the first date, so what's wrong about birth control question?

My reasoning is this: if a guy is about to have sex with someone he just met, he MUST be jumping out of his way to use condom. It's a MUST no matter how many times we flirted dirty. And if he even thinks of not using a condom with a girl he just met, that means he was likely to do it before, which means he is at a much higher risk of having an STD and I'm not cool with that. 

I don't trust people who even entertain the idea of having sex with a person they don't know without a condom. I can't risk that even if he ends up using a condom. Doesn't matter that we discussed the sex positions or what we like in bed. I want to feel safe and I don't feel safe even if he thinks of not using a condom on a first date even for a second. 

Hope I explained my reasoning well. Question is - am I the asshole for that line of reasoning?

Now complete the following example-
input: I was falsely accused of rape in high school. While she never filed a police report, she did tell everyone. She did this because I live in a really religious community, and having sex before marriage is a big no no. (Mormon)

Well, we had sex in high school (consensual sex) and when her parents found out about us having sex, she pulled the rape card, so she wouldn’t get in trouble.

Rumors spread that we had sex, and she told everyone I raped her. Obviously this ruined the rest of my high school years. I had no friends. My life was ruined. 

After high school I left and moved 4 hours away. I deleted all social media, made new accounts with no high school followers, and started over. 

All of my new friends know nothing about this. When asked about how high school was or if I have any high school friends I simply just say “I was weird in high school, kind of lonely. Didn’t talk to anyone” and end it at that.

It’s been a couple years, and I’m in college. I recently had a girlfriend (we just broke up) for several months and I never told her anything about it. She wonders why I am so secretive about my past, made new social media, etc. 


So WIBTA if I never told my future girlfriends about this? I don’t want to risk it. I think they’ll have a thought in their head that I was lying about it, and I really raped her, etc etc. 


On another note, what should I do?

Now complete the following example-
input: I am a student at a medical university, and yesterday I was walking to the hospital building to get lunch. The main hospital lobby has a piano in it which people are welcome to play. (Usually people play nice classical pieces with soft melodies etc...)

When I walked in there was a group of 4 or so people around the piano and one guy playing. They were singing ""praise God, praise God"" at the top of their lungs to whatever tune the guy was playing on the piano. For some reason, as I walked by, I became irrationally angry at this. I kept thinking ""get your praise God BS out of this secular university hospital!!"" I'm annoyed again just thinking about it. I didn't say or do anything about it I just kept walking to the cafeteria, but other people that were walking by were smiling and clapping along, which annoyed me more. 


I think the reasons I'm annoyed are;
1) it's a secular university
2) it's a hospital lobby where other people are bound not to feel as happy as you do
3) if you're overjoyed about some good news it's likely the doctor you should be praising 
4) don't throw God in my face 

I feel like an asshole for getting this annoyed about it. I'd like to know if you all feel like I am too.

Now complete the following example-
input: [I am a 21M, girlfriend 21F] My side: Her and her best “guy friend” have been in a pretty volatile friendship, on and off fighting and not. So Thursday night, I drop her off at a party at his house. I have to get up early for work so I stay in. She says she wants to be home by 12, I said ok, text me when you’re home. 

At 1 am, she’s at the bar where he works at, posting kind of inappropriate pictures. No big deal, we talked about it whatever. 

We’ve had numerous problems in the past like this where she would go to bars and parties that she swore she didn’t want to be at; she was never there at any of the times (2,3,4 hours past when she said she would be leaving), and generally not who she said she would be with. She claims she was not going to any bars, but I wake up and always find her there. 

Two weeks ago, she’s suppose to be coming over. It’s late, 3-4 AM. She hasn’t shown yet, so I call, say I’m coming to pick her up. 4 am I arrive, she reads my message, never comes out. I wait 20-30 minutes, and she never comes out. She’s at the guys house. 

My roommate and very good friend, early in our relationship heard a rumor; At a bar, someone asked if she was single, she said no. Always kind of in the back of my head. 

Back to Thursday night / Friday afternoon. While in the tanning bed, I looked at her phone. I am obviously suspicious, and I feel have a reason to be. I found some videos of her and the guy friend laying on his bed, which I find extremely inappropriate. 

Her side of the story is she’s fine, and that her father, mother, and sister agree her friend is not threatening or inappropriate because they are such good friends. She believes she is rightfully mad because I was distrusting. 

AITA? I feel like she’s being extremely manipulative, and if I were to talk into the room with them she would absolutely know it was wrong.

She threatened to cut herself if I didn’t give mine to her first, which I thought was just an empty threat. Sends me a picture of a fake looking cut on her thumb. Goes even further, another one on her index, darker this time. I called her to confront her about it and she said random shit. Then sent me one with her palm bloodied. Now, this looked decently real and shit. When I asked about it more she said “OMG, can’t you tell it’s fake?”. No, I’m not joking. When I asked why, she said it was because I wouldn’t give her my address. Are you fucking kidding me?

Now complete the following example-
input: So, I met this guy, let’s call him JOHN in college.

Middle of my freshman year, I broke up with my hs boyfriend from home. The breakup was mutual and amicable at first, but took a turn once my ex heard I had started seeing other people after we broke up. So, JOHN, being a nice friend, moved a third mattress into his and his roommate’s  (ADAM) room for a week so I could be w my friends. 

Shortly after, I made out with ADAM, but clarified I didn’t want a relationship, and we only just kissed a few times. ADAM was livid because he told me he had strong feelings for me, and we didn’t end on good terms. I had set boundaries before that I didn’t want a relationship, but ended up hurting ADAM anyway. So, JOHN, took my defense and said ADAM was being a jerk about the whole thing. JOHN suggests I should’ve made out w him instead of ADAM, avoiding the drama I was currently in. He then tried to kiss me, and I dodged it, but we laughed it off, and I told him it would never happen. Totally fine and our friendship grew.

middle of my soph year, my new boyfriend (Carl), and I just broke up. My heart was broken, seriously. But JOHN, being the guy that he is, was there every second I needed. Took me shopping, for ice cream, invited me over to watch movies, ETC. I guess we “flirted” by doing stuff alone like watching movies and holding hands, but I never had romantic feelings and felt like I made it clear when he tried to kiss me previously. Over that winter break, JOHN and I talked almost everyday on FaceTime and texted all the time. He was all around a great friend, and I appreciated having him around, but he would casually say he loved me and kissed me a lot. On New Years, JOHN texted me a very long message saying that he was totally in love with me, that I’m the person he thinks about before he falls asleep and as soon as he wakes up, that I’m the most amazing person and girl he’s ever met, etc,. I responded thanking him, but that I wasn’t interested in something like that, and he accepted it, and we stayed friends.

after winter break, I got back together with Carl. Since JOHN had been there with me through all the BS, I thought it would be better for JOHN to hear from me that Carl and I are back together, so I told him. He told me that he needed space, blocked me on Instagram, completely ignored me anytime he saw me, and still does today, over a year later. I recently texted him to apologize for how things went down (although I feel as if I didn’t do much wrong), and he basically just said thanks. We had a great friendship, and it completely ended when I told him Carl and I were getting back together. We don’t even look at each other when we see each other, wave, say hi, nothing. 

So...AITA for the way I handled things with John? Or Adam? Ps, Carl and I broke up for good right after all of this.

My (F26) boyfriend (M25) have been together for almost a year now. At first it was amazing (definitely honeymoon phase) and that lasted a while. Lots of cuddling and intamacy (not talking about sexual). My love language is a Physical Touch with a dash of Words of Affirmation. His love language is solely Acts of Service. What started out as a very fulfilling physical relationship has turned to pretty much zero physical contact. I know he loves me, he says 'I love you' and he always cooks me dinner. He does the laundry so I have clean work clothes. He fixed my car in the middle of a snow storm. But he doesn't hug or kiss me unless I ask. And cuddling is right off the table. We sleep against either side of the bed. Its breaking my heart, and making me feel unwanted. I can rationalize it and tell myself he loves me but I dont't feel it. I'm having a hard time with the feeling of instant rejection when I go to cuddle in bed and he asks me not to.

input: This happened several years back. My best friend lived in another city with a bunch of mutual friends. Her then boyfriend lived abroad. He had planned something special for her birthday even though he wouldn't have been able to visit and he was in touch with the aforementioned mfs to help him. She visits my city, which happens to be both our hometown, the weekend before her birthday. I was asked by one mf to get one of her gifts as planned by the bf and I was told that I would be reimbursed. It was sort of an expensive gift, not exorbitant but definitely over the budget one would spend for a friend's birthday gift. So we went shopping, stopped by a place for the gift and I asked her to pick the one she liked. She selects one, loves it and I think, fine maybe we should get this. We decide to grab a bite before buying it. And while we were at the restaurant, I receive a call from the mf asking me to abort the plan and that the bf wanted to get it himself. So I forgot about it and when we were done shopping she stopped at the gift shop again, took the one she had picked first and was just kinda admiring it. So this is where I know I screwed up. I went ahead and got it for her anyway. My reasoning being anyway the initial plan was to have me get it so it should be fine and if the bf doesn't want that, it can still be a gift from me. That blew up. I understand that he wanted to get it for her, but it's not such a gift that you can have only one of it.(think handbag, shoes, plush toy). And anyway if her boyfriend got the same one it will surely be extra special. I apologised to both of them. But it ended badly and they ending up fighting. They both stopped talking to me and blocked me on all social media platforms. I truly felt awful, and I understand why the bf was upset but I still feel the reaction was a bit extreme. It was not like I planned to sabotage their special day. Please tell me, AITA?

Note: things are good with my friend now. She started talking to me again after a year and they broke up sometime after that for reasons unrelated.

Now complete the following example-
input: First time posting.

Getting right into it, about a year ago I met this girl at work. Let's call her Sam. Sam and I became friends pretty quickly as most people at our job are older. Sam deals with anxiety/ depression and doesn't have a lot of friends, so I made an effort to invite her to outtings with my friends outside of work, who are the most supportive humans I know. As we got closer and hungout more, it became pretty clear Sam liked me. Eventually, Sam told me this and I explained that I like being her friend, but was not interested in anything else, which Sam was cool with.

Fast forward a year later and I start to feel like Sam has become way too invested in me for being just a work friend. Examples include her leaving work early because I didn't grab lunch with her (we normally get food together) and Sam calling me out at work about how I haven't invited her places when I hangout with my friends.  

Recently, Sam has been telling me that she needed to talk to me about something important, but whenever i brought it up she would never say what it was. This happened about 6 times over the course of a month. Finally, this past weekend at about 4am her and two of my friends were at a bar and Sam told me that she loved me and has never felt this way before. I didn't say much bc my friends were right there. After several texts the next day Sam confirmed this was what she wanted to tell me. I told Sam that I need space and that we can't do lunch anymore but when It comes to being in the office together that I won't act any differently toward her. Sam has called out of work sick since this happened so I haven't seen her since. I feel Sam is way too emotiallly invested in me to the point where it is unhealthy which wad affecting me at work. I also realize Sam deals with a lot of health issues and has a very limited friend group. 

AITA for telling my work friend Sam I need space after she admitted she loved me?

Now complete the following example-
input: My group was assigned a project of making a poster for an engineering class, and I offered to my group to design the poster so that they could just add in the text and we would be finished. There only thing was that this project was assigned on a Thursday and I told them ahead of time that I wouldn't be able to work on it at all the entire weekend, so I was going to finish it by Friday. They all agreed and thanked me for it because I was the only person in my group that knew how to use Photoshop well. The same day that the project was assigned, my groupmates got together and did all of the research before I even got to contribute. Cool I guess, now all I need to do is design the poster! The only thing I didn't know was that my groupmates already had an idea in their head of what the poster should look like.

I spent a good 4 hours that night creating a poster for my group that I figured would suffice, but once I showed my group, they said that it wasn't what they were thinking, and asked me to change a few things. I was a little annoyed at that point but it wasn't that big of a deal, so I changed the few things that they wanted the next day and showed them what I had changed. I got a message back a few hours later that they had gotten together and changed a few things about their poster concept and asked me to change some more, and even asked me to replace a part of what I had made with someone else's, that didn't even fit the rest of the design. 

At this point it was already Friday night and I didn't have much more time left, so on Saturday I just added all of the information and graphs to my original design and sent it to them saying that it was going to need to do because I didn't have any more time to work on this. They decided to message me back saying that they were just going to do it by hand and that it wasn't a big deal, and I'm still pissed off that I wasted a good 5 hours working on something that my group isn't even going to use. I attached a picture of what I made so that at least someone could see it. It's definitely not my best work and was really rushed, but I still think it would have gotten us a good grade.

Now complete the following example-
input: TL;DR at bottom.

So this is a bit complex, let me fill you in on background- we are both non-confrontational people. The disputes prior to this were minor. Let me also add that I absolutely **despise** lying. This has been difficult at times, as she was abused, emotionally and physically, in past relationships, and lies chronically to save herself from retribution of her SO. This behavior is well ingrained in her personality, however I have made leaps and bounds towards ending these behaviors and promoting honesty in our relationship. One of the results of her abuse however is her fear of upsetting me. (Let me add I have never and will never lay a hand on her in anger.) This fear manifests itself as her withholding information she fears will upset me, thus leading her to lie. This has nearly ceased over the past few months.

Til tonight.

We have an extremely active sexual life, as it was in part some similar kinks that first jump started our relationship. We are a long distance relationship, so maintaining our sexual activities is heavily reliant on Skype based ""playtime"" which between our visits slates our thirst for one another. Without going into detail these consist of me telling her precisely what to do while we both pleasure ourselves in tandem. I have a good sense of her 'rhythm' and would compliment this with questions asking her if she was close etc. to time my commands accordingly. I thought I had it down.

*Thought.*

Recently, I purchased a toy for her that aides our bedroom escapades. This has given her some genuinely astounding experiences. However, during the post-playtime glow of endorphins, she broke down crying and told me something long the lines of ""I'm so sorry OP... I know you told me never to lie or fake anything (referencing a prior conversation about faking smiles for the same reasons) but I normally fake every orgasm you see me have."" She then goes on to explain that this toy that I purchased for her has given her the best sexual experiences of her life. She explains that most girls fake orgasms through anything but penetration (a fact I know well) but this whole time I assumed she was one of the rare few who could.

Reasoning for said upsettness- ~~(English lvl. 100)~~ At the outset I specifically stated she should never lie or fake an orgasm to please me. I repeated this often. She reassured me every time I voiced these wishes that she wouldn't. She defied this. I am extremely hurt she openly defied my wishes and lied to me regularly in regards to a portion of our relationship that due to its nature is interconnected to practically all other aspects. She faked it. Lied to me every time. I am oddly hurt and angry.

TL;DR- So, proctologist pros. Am I the asshole for being hurt and angry with my SO for lying practically every day about truly orgasming to 'please' me due to Pavlovian conditioning form past abusive relationships?

Now complete the following example-
input: A girl I dated a few years ago and I have remained good friends since our breakup. I've still had romantic feelings for her since then and the past 2 years she's been dating this guy that nobody seems to understand them as a couple. I've never cared for the guy despite my best efforts. I want to support her more than anything and if she's happy that's great.

I've known the past few months things between them have been pretty rocks with multiple times of them almost breaking up. They have an apartment together and their lease runs up this summer, so staying together for the time being makes sense on a lot of levels.

Last weekend I get a call from her at 1030pm asking if I can come over because she might need some help. 20 minutes I show up and knock on the door, she comes out with her dog on a leash and wearing a hat. She is clearly upset and after we start a walk she says that he hit her.

I ask if it was open handed or a fist (not that it matters) and she doesn't know, she just knows her cheekbone hurts. Apparently they were is a super heavy argument, which has become the norm lately, and she shoved him. His response, from his perspective, was he tried hitting her hat off her head. But then she tells me this isn't the first time he's hit her but the second time.  After about a 45 minute walk she goes back to the apartment.  

Since then I don't know much about their interactions hut I've understood she has been looking around for a new place. She's been staying in the spare bedroom and he's been in the master.

I had an opportunity to see him tonight at a social event and in private I approached him, stating if he touched her again he's gonna wind up in a hospital. He asks if she told me what happens and I say ""yes she told me. Get home safely"" and then walk away, to which he responds FU.

2 hours later I check my phone and have 3 missed calls from her and a text saying ""wtf""

I haven't been able to talk to her since then, but AITA for stepping in? I just want to protect my friend, romantic feelings aside. How could she interpret this to make me out to be the bad guy?

So this story starts back in January of this year. My gf and I had been together for a few months and prom was coming up. She had never properly been asked to a dance before so I wanted it to be special. I spent about three hours making a poster with the word ""prom?"" On it in several different color patterns. She happily agrees to go with me. Everything is fine until a few days ago, when my gf and I were walking together. A mutual friend of ours stops us and tells my gf that she got the go ahead from our VP and all they'd have to do is get their prom tickets. When I inquired wtf she was talking about, gf chimes in saying she was taking other girl to prom so she could go (at least a month after she already agreed to go with me). When I asked her when she was planning on telling me, she responded that she had been meaning to, but hadn't since she figured I wouldn't mind. After that I walked away and didn't hear any more of it. 
(Not worried about her cheating on me or anything, just upset that she agreed to this without telling me and assumed I wouldn't mind)
Is this no big deal? Am I overreacting? I just need some unbiased opinions on this situation. Also this is my first post so I'm sorry if I do something wrong.

Now complete the following example-
input: My SIL is having a hard time getting pregnant. It's been a year since she started trying and she has become angry and bitter that she isn't pregnant. 

She openly admits to hating pregnant women now bc she isnt pregnant. 

SIL never liked my sister very much, but liked her even less when sister got pregnant. Now when my sister comes to visit my parents (SIL and my brother live with my parents) SIL avoids seeing her and goes to the basement in her room and cries. 

Things SIL has done to make baby talk uncomfortable:
* tells my mom to not leave baby stuff where she can see it.
* tells my mom she cant make baby blankets in the living room,  since seeing them upsets her.
* closes the door to the spare bedroom bc she doesnt want to see the baby stuff in it. 
* is mean when she gets a baby shower invite or someone she knows gets pregnant. 

Etc.

I get along with my SIL, even tho she is admittedly kind of a b*tch.  So when I found out I was pregnant, I was hesitant to tell her and my brother. 

A month ago I was visiting my parents and they (sil/bro)  asked me if I was pregnant. I panicked and said no. In truth I was 2 months. 

(Mom tells me later that after I tell them I'm not pregnant, bro and SIL talk about it and feel bad that I'm having a hard time getting pregnant too. They sympathize with me.)

I felt bad lying but I didn't know how to tell them. I was sure if I told her she would cry and make a scene and not want anything to do with me anymore. 

The next day I talked to my brother and told him I was pregnant and I was sorry for lying. I explained that I was worried about SIL and if she would hate me knowing I was pregnant. He said not to worry and he would talk to her. 

After talking to his wife, they decide they are mad at me for lying? 

So today, a month after, I have another doc appt and come visit my parents. SIL walks into the house and I say hello, as usual. She walks right by me as if I were invisible and ignores me completely. She goes to the basement and I never see her again for the rest of the day.

I realize I shouldn't have lied,  and I apologized and explained why I did so. But doesnt this prove my point? 

Or am I the asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm finishing an exchange program soon and hence moving out of the dorm I lived in for the past year.

However, I recently discovered through my roommate who moved out earlier that the rent payment system here is so bad that the university staff in charge of the student dorms actually have no way of checking whether you've paid the rent or not. The way this works is each month tenants get sent a slip to take to the post office, pay the rent in cash, and then hand the blank slip back to the university. Because of this, my friend who already moved back to his home country got away with not paying rent for half the year.

I thought this was just plain dumb. The thing is, I can afford to pay the last month's worth of rent, but having such a big loophole makes me want to just save myself the money. My friend on the other hand didn't pay because he didn't have cash and the university wouldn't accept credit or bank transfers. 

On the payment due date I just walked into the office, handed in the blank slip, and when they assumed I had paid I just walked out. I feel morally conflicted as technically I cheated them, but at the same time it's difficult to feel bad for making a public university lose a sum of pocket change. If my dorm was privately owned or something, I don't think I would have felt the same. If anything I kind of want to blame the university for having such dodgy management in the first place. 

So Reddit, AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: I came home tonight and my wife was telling me about her day. One item she recalled was going to target, and she specifically mentioned getting meyer's clean day soap. The last time meyer's clean day soap was purchased was the first time we purchased it for our house - she specifically requested for me to get it. I had asked, ""which variety"" and she had told me, ""any"" I then, like an idiot got different varieties of dish and hand soap, ruining the aesthetic she was trying to present in our kitchen. (never expressed to me.  No fight from this)

Anyways, that left us with extra of this expensive dish soap, which I thought we would use next and just get matching hand soap for that time.

So, she mentions she got new dish and hand soap, and I replied with ""ooh, remember that I got that other one last time that we should probably use?""

Her tone then becomes annoyed with me and she says that's not the one she likes and she got the variety she likes. At this point, I'm confused because regardless of whether it's her favorite variety or not, we should use that first. However, now I'm feeling a heavy bad attitude coming from her - my assumption (from our usual poor communication) is that she feels accused of a bad memory or lack of observation in our daily life by me. (She thinks I'm saying she didn't remember we had the extra soap and that she's stupid for it.)

So, after asking why she's perturbed, and verifying it is because she is upset about me asking a question about whether she may have forgotten the extra soap (she told me that my questioning of her was rude/offensive) I try to explain myself in hopes of setting the record straight, because I had absolutely no intention of passing any judgment about whether she knew the soap was there or not. 3x I explain that me asking why she got new soap was not me accusing her or having a poor memory or not being observant, and that it was simply because I could easily imagine MYSELF forgetting the extra soap was there that I asked that question. Each time, she answers in a fashion that ignores my explanation, and only escalates her frustration with me. I am remaining calm in my explanation the entire time, and quite honestly, begging to be understood.

Probably shouldn't have bothered explaining, but not being understood makes me feel utterly empty and disrespected / marginalized / villainized.

Anyways, this ends in her giving me ""advice"" as to how I could approach the situation better, while she spoke of each of us only being able worry about ourselves in the situation and that the only way something like this would improve in the future was for us both to work on our own end. (which I agree with, but paired with the ""advice"" to me on how to approach it, and no outward recognition about what she could have done different to help, seems quite hypocritical.)

Anyways, AITA?

Any thoughts are appreciated here. I really need the sanity check, even if it's hard truth for me to face.

Thank you.

Now complete the following example-
input: So basically, I'm an only child and I'm very close to my parents. I was living far away from home and working for a while but I ended up getting very depressed after some years and quit my job. I moved back home to live my parents for a while until I find a new job.   


My mom is pretty much the breadwinner of the family and runs a business and my dad helps her with the documents and stuff like that. She grew her business from practically nothing and now she's doing really well – in fact, her efforts and her business are the only reason I was even able to go to college (she paid for everything). I really am very proud of her because she made it big and that's hard for a woman to do because the country/ community I live in is super patriarchal and male chauvinistic.   


Anyway now she sees me – a jobless 24 year old/ with no direction in life/ looking for a new job and she starts hinting that I should join her business and take over the company. I totally understand why she would want me to continue her legacy but I honestly have no interest/ aptitude for the kind of business she's in. I think I would be really unhappy working with her/ for her. She is a great mom and we love each other, but she is super controlling and dominating and I know we would fight all the time if we worked together. But still, she insists that I'd be great at the business....   


I'm a digital designer so I try to help out in whatever way I can, like I'm building a website for her company. But I just don't see myself actually joining the business and dealing with all her stuck up clients. And today she asked me to come to this big company event and I was definitely going to be there but then we ended up fighting over a stupid thing (which was my fault) and then she starts yelling at me about how I don't do anything for her and how I'm useless. Later in the day, I text her saying I'm not coming. That was shitty of me because I know she wanted me to be there. And then she texts me back saying she never expects anything from me because I'm a disappointment.  


ANYWAY. I guess I'd just really like to know whether I'm an asshole for not helping her with work/ continuing her legacy/ and just generally not being there for her after she has done so much for me.

input: My friend had 3 positive dollar store pregnancy tests and was on birth control. If it's true, she's only 4-5 weeks along. She has one child already and is really struggling financially. I have bought her groceries on multiple occasions and pay for her to eat every time we go out.  
She took the tests because she believed her abusive boyfriend and his buddy tampered with her birth control. I believe this to be true. She was very upset when she found out, but as soon as she told the boyfriend, she became excited. She did not want another child yet until she found out she was going to have one and he brainwashed her into thinking this was what she wants. She refuses to terminate or give the baby up even though she can barely afford to care for the child she has. She wants to give her boyfriend another child like he wants. 

I have mixed emotions about all of this, but I ultimately am disappointed in her and I'm annoyed that she is not living her life for herself. Nothing she does is for her own happiness, it's all for her boyfriend. She could have a great job with her degree, but because her boyfriend wants her to work at \[insert big department store here\] with him, she won't look for another job. He wants her there so she doesn't make much money and so that they are eligible for government assistance. He will not get a better job to support her either. 

I have not expressed my feelings to her and I don't know that I would tell her I feel this way unless I was certain that I'd be okay with never speaking to her again. It's bothering me because she's not acting like herself. I am tempted to end the friendship. I feel guilty for being so annoyed, but I want her to be better. Am I an asshole for feeling this way?

Now complete the following example-
input: Sorry for the long post but tl;dr near the bottom.

I enrolled in a project course at my college back in May. The timeframe is flexible: you decide with your professor how long the course should be (up to 1 year), and that determines how much work must be in it, how harsh it's marked, etc. It's expected to at least be graduate level quality. I decided with my professor I only wanted to devote four months to it, as it corresponded to the spring/summer months and if it were longer, my other courses would interfere with it.

Part of these courses is you go in with a project proposal, it's accepted or declined, and if it's accepted, you do only what you defined in your proposal. To make it more manageable, you can define due dates for portions of the project and a proposed marking scheme. Everything was accepted and off I went.

Over the months and after updating my professor with my progress, demonstrating my work, and discussion meetings with him, he kept asking for more and more. He loved my work but thought I could make so and so adjustments to my proposal and implement them. I was keen on the idea as it could mean better marks. If he liked my work, surely encompassing even more would be better? He continually told me to not worry about the due dates so much and instead focus on adding abc or xyz to my project and just updating him with the progress.

I took his advice. I missed deadlines by weeks. It got to the point where the final due date approached and he told me again and again don't worry about it, just keep working. It worried me because I was soon starting a full courseload but still kept going anyways. It became difficult to manage what is basically a mini-thesis alongside a 15hr/week schedule of lectures and labs, but since I was assured to not worry about deadlines (I assumed my 4 months would end up being 8-10 months), I spread things out a bit.

On November 1st, I was abruptly told through e-mail that I have exactly two weeks to submit everything. At this point, my project was completely different from what I originally planned to do, and I wasn't finished. I mean, I finished what I set out to do originally but not the added stuff my professor convinced me to do. I had to rush things and admittedly submitted subpar work to my standards. In my summary paper, it was clear things were in disarray but I had a time frame all of a sudden when previously I didn't.

I ended up getting a 20%, not only failing but killing my GPA. I was told it had ""no academic merit"" and he was ""embarrassed"" to be part of it. He said he would never work with me again. How much this hurt me was indescribable: he was my favorite professor, an inspiring force in previous classes I had with him, and we were on a first name basis to top it off. He never replied to my e-mails.

#tl;dr

Signed up for a 4-month course with my favorite professor. He told me to not worry about the 4-months and take as much time as I need to add things to my project not originally in the project scope. I did my best until was abruptly told to hand it in and I submitted poor work. I failed.

#end tl;dr

WIBTA if I appealed his grade? Normal procedure is to hand in material verbatim, but since I got my mark, I've still been working on the project, even knowing I've failed. What I would have considered 55-60% grade material back then I firmly believe is 80-90% material. If I appealed, I would obviously hand in my revised work. The supervising professor left the country for sabbatical and would otherwise be unable to verify the same work was handed in. He's going to look bad and cannot defend himself.

Even if I was caught handing in different work, I have a strong case I think for a re-evaluation:

- I have documented proof of him stating to not worry about deadlines
- likewise I have proof of him expressing desire for project expansion, which AFAIK is allowed but should warrant extensions
- and I have proof he looked at my source code but I didn't even submit it. He marked strictly off my report

Now complete the following example-
input: Pretty low impact one here but I thought reddit might enjoy it. My girlfriend, her mom, and my mom teamed up to get me a Nintendo Switch and Mario Odyssey for Christmas! Super surprised, I was wanting one bad and hunting down good deals with no luck. Very grateful for that. We've been playing it a bunch since getting it with me holding the sticks for most of the time (video games, especially Nintendo/Mario, have been a huge part of my life ever since the original). My SO is entertained by video games but usually gets bored after 15 minutes and moves onto something else. I get way into it, and I am WAY into Odyssey. 

I had been talking about this level called ""New Donk City"" and how hilarious that name was, how I couldn't wait to get there, etc. Today, I was at a rehearsal (I'm a musician), and after a bit of playing I see a text from my SO from an hour prior. It basically said ""Hey we're playing New Donk City \[oops emoji\], do you want us to not beat it?"" (we have friends in town). I obviously put my drumsticks down and responding ""Wait! No! I want to play it!"" It was too late.

Later on speakerphone I very calmly and light heartedly said ""Hey, I really wanted to play that level, I was looking forward to it. How many moons did y'all get?"" She said ""...all of them"". I calmly said something like ""aw man"", and she proceeded to shrug it off saying things like ""whatever you can just replay it who cares?"" And I said ""Well the level will have changed and the collectables will be grayed out"", to which she said ""Oh well just start over then I don't know"". I stayed calm and said, see y'all later, bye! 

I then texted her very respectfully how it made me feel and that though she may find video games insignificant, they are very important in my life and I was very excited to experience this one fresh. She, through a few texts, got defensive, and even tried to guilt me into feeling bad about the way I felt a couple times. Things like ""K well everyone is freaking out over here now"" and ""I get it Aaron obviously we wouldn't have done it if we knew you would be like this"". To be clear, I simply stated that I was upset by what she did knowing how important the game was to me. I said that we'll just start a new file and replay it all (honestly, I'm okay with that). She still has not apologized for playing without me nor the way she handled the situation, and she's seeming like she has no intention to do so. This is what's getting me. 

So. Am I the asshole here? Like I know I've said it a thousand times how calmly I handled this (rare form for me), but am I an inherent asshole for getting upset by this? I know it's ""just a game"" and all, but she knows how much work I've put into the game and how clearly enthralled I was with exploring everything. She's an awesome person who is generally very in touch with approaching conflicts and all that, which is making me think I might be the asshole. Let me know, y'all.

Now complete the following example-
input: Buckle up folks because this is a long one. 

So about 2 and a half years ago I reconnected with a girl I met online from canada that really seemed to click with me, we shared alot of personal interests, links, etc. She was in this on off thing with another guy and living with an abusive father. She sends me a nude which causes the on off guy to flip out on me over Skype and I not wanting drama backed off for awhile but something about her hooked me like a drug. We start talking again and she says she wants to be with me and builds up the idea of a dream future. I'm into it naturally but she seems really avoidant of making our status known to anyone which is fine, shes got that weird ex right? So I message a mutual friend and he blows up and starts a shitstorm of drama because she was evidently sexting him, the ex, and making plans with me. I have alot of drama in the place I'm living at the time and see red flags so I deuce and end up in another relationship that I rapidly lose interest in but hang around because it's better than where I was before (I am the asshole for that I know) 

Jump forward 6-7 months and she starts messaging me on Skype again and we reconnect as friends and I tell her I still think about her and flirt a bit, a week or two later she sends a picture of her wet panties to my Skype while I'm at work and current gf sees it at home and almost kicks me out making me homeless across the country from family so once again seeing a red flag I block her on everything, 4 months later current gf cheats on me when I play fallout 4 after it comes out for 3days so I say screw it and deuce. Being in a bad place mentally and stuck moving in with parents again because my car died in a flood and I didnt have much money, i cant stop thinking about Canada girl so i unblock and message her, shes moved out of her dads, broken things off with the ex more completely and now has an american trucker friend paying for her apartment while she is slowly slipping into depression from abusive father and ex(he had been visiting her a few times at this point) we hit it off again and trauma bound over childhood stuff (toxic abusive mother and constant fighting as i grew up with step dad) and one day she just vanishes for 18 hours and I panic because shes had several prior suicide attempts. I call numerous people trying to figure out if shes okay including a guy who she hung out with irl sometimes, he flips out on me and tries to tell me to go find an american girl so that sets off a weird flag... she calls me a short time later with a black eye and mad I contacted her friend up there (I somehow ignored alot of red flags) 

Suddenly she drops a bomb on me, her dad showed up and hit her ""accidentally"" because she wouldn't hug him and she also breaks down and informs me of just how abusive he was when she lived with him. In the following month she spirals out hardcore, trucker friend lost job, she isnt working, food runs out, shes starving slowly to death, suddenly starts acting really strange and informs me she ordered helium to off herself. I call a crisis team immediately because I've fallen hard at this point and I've lost several friends to suicide so its terrifying to just let someone go through that, cop and psych lady show up, ask questions, she convinces things are fine and they leave. She panics after because she self medicated for epilepsy with weed and didnt want to get in trouble but she also cancels the helium order.

At this point she starts disappearing on me again but I dont give up because I'm terrified she'll off herself. Turns out shes talking to abusive ex again, so I in my infinite wisdom, somehow get roped into a 3 way relationship for the sake of getting her away from stalker father and not ending up homeless or starving to death. Trucker guy also has job again at this point and wants to help too (hes her friend of 15 years who has always been hung up on her but she refuses to date because shes not into him) 

SO the first 3 months of the 2 year shit saga begin... I fly up, the other 2 drive up a week later, I help her get her passport renewed, clean up her apartment (which is a disgusting wreck, she was letting her dog shit on the balcony and it was like 4 inches thick but I was in the army and a plumber at one point so fuck it, shes been through some fucked up shit, I'll clean the place nbd) she meanwhile fucks me like crazy and ignored her ex and tells me she just roped him in to help get this all done (hes already been a sleezebag, I moved in with him shortly before going up to Canada and his place was a shithole too and I guess I have a bleeding heart) and shed drop him after. So first we drive all the way to trucker guys hometown with ex guy trying to sexualize her and grope her every chance he got despite her trauma and her not initiating and obviously being uncomfortable and telling him to stop.

After a weird argument there with her being pissed with everyone but me; me her and ex continue to his place against everything she had told me before, basically I end up having 2 or 3 threesomes minus the fact the guy gives a weird vibe, her and ex start having arguments that spiral into insanity and end with her locking herself in the bathroom and self harming(no shame, just stating for clarity) and only allowing me In to calm her down, he knocks her up but we dont know it at the time (I'm sterile from birth because mom smoked and drank while pregnant, its caused 2 other relationships to end which is why I got tested because having a kid wasnt working out) and she starts getting really sick he takes her to hospital while I'm at work and i get a call saying he ""lost her"" she freaked out and had an argument and let her walk off in a major city by herself in a delirious state and she gets lost and almost snatched but she goes knocking on doors and a stranger helps her back. A day or two later upset at him, she goes through his laptop and desktop. First she finds out he cheated on her with 14 other people and then she finds 10 gigs of .... well some shit you just cant fucking unsee. It's all I can do not to kill the bastard and I feel sick af about everything, she blows up his Facebook, he comes home, immediately wipes hard drives and destroys computers while we pack up and gtfo.

Queue Feb of 2017, it's already been the most insane shit I've ever been apart of in my life, but she has me hooked and convinced we need eachother. We move up to Trucker guys hometown and he helps us get set up before she starts getting really sick again (we hadn't been eating well at this point because money got drained away by her ""needing"" weed, bills and ex guy being literal garbage) so we take her to a hospital there, she finds out shes 3-4 months pregnant and insists on abortion because it's ex guys kid and hes a pedo. I personally do not support abortion myself but I do believe in your body your choice. We end up going to the wrong clinic and it gets botched, she almost bleeds out but makes it, recovery is long and I spend the next few months keeping the house somewhat clean (I've been the only one cleaning since this started) and we have a backyard now so I lax on walking the dogs. Meanwhile with no vehicle I've found a job 1.5 miles away from the house at a mcdonalds and it's the best I can do but I'm walking there and back every day and I start losing steam on keeping up with the housework solo while she recovers for the next 3-4 months evidently, in this time I catch her flirting with other guys online and lying to me about things, she also caught me apologizing to my previous ex in secret because with what I've let go at this point, breaking up with her and deucing seemed pretty shit.

Shes not getting periods at this point, something is wrong, not pregnancy, some super rare shit where uterine tissue turns into bone and it blocks the way. So she has to have another surgery around this time last year, they fail at fixing it and retry (successfully) a few weeks later and she has to have a catheter for a week, in this time period she told me shed leave if I didnt let her have an open relationship and I caved because I have problems and we've already been through so much and she still talks about suicide. I say it's okay as long as I'm informed/involved and she starts acting shady. I had work the day of the first surgery and I came home and had a weird feeling after some recent arguments about her suddenly telling me shes poly and how I'm not meeting her needs (but she doesnt want to have sex at this point because pain, ex, trauma, etc.) And I find out shes been lying to me about video chatting with a guy who bought her a vibrator and she was sexting him the whole time and logs prior to her getting me to agree to the open relationship thing (meanwhile i have no desire to pursue anyone else, I have enough to deal with) so I send her a text saying ""we need to talk"" and she flips out and says I'm a piece of shit for causing her anxiety when she just had surgery and it turns into the first of many terrible arguments where she turns everything around on me. Christmas eve me and trucker guy have been making trips to Colorado to get her weed, the red a horrible blizzard, hes a dumbass and I warn him to slow down and we get into an almost fatal wreck with the trailer of a semi, trucks totaled, hes fine, I have bruised ribs from bouncing off center console (get a Ford f150 if you wanna feel safe lol) we have to jump through some hoops but we make it home in time for xmas, a few days later shes picking fights about me walking the dogs or doing housework because she just had surgery but I'm still going to my new job at a phone store making more money and supporting us both with bruised ribs which is agony in and of itself, fast forward (there's alot of fights she starts over minor shit

Now complete the following example-
input: My class (Grade 9) is the oldest class in my school, and we've been under the same advisor since Grade 7. The Grade 10 are supposed to be the oldest, but my school is small, and has so little students that whole classes are empty. Since no one is in Gr 10, all responsibilities given to the seniors, such as looking after the lower years, helping plan for school events, and filling in for teachers, is dumped on us. Our advisor entrusts me and the other officers of our class (I am the class secretary) to manage the class, and rarely ever helps us, which is understandable considering that my school's staff is limited and she has to teach five other classes. 

She has been our advisor for three years, and has dealt with a lot of our shit, so sometimes she gets mad at us for the smallest reasons because she's really tired of us as she has voiced out countless times. This week, my class has been preparing for an outing for our assigned clubs. Combined with our other projects that we had to submit within the week, we were all really tired. Usually, in the mornings when we wait for our first subject teacher, we like to mess around and talk before lectures start. This morning we were particularly noisy, our advisor comes up, yelling ""WHO'S SCREAMING?"" then accuses a girl who's known for being loud. She goes apeshit, kicks over our trashcan, pushes stuff off the teachers' table, and breaks her own glasses. She rants to us how tired she is because the coordinator of events of my school is absent and that she has to take care of the outing, then starts calling us inconsiderate for not helping, despite the fact that it was us who planned it in the first place. She starts crying, makes someone call in the Gr 7, the only other highschool class. After humiliating us in front of the Gr 7 and FINALLY giving the announcement she was supposed to give, she lets them go back and starts saying we're so irresponsible, that we're the worst batch she's ever handled, then says ""I hate to compare, but it's true."" She says how we were abusing her because, and that we should be good to her because she's our ""second parent"". She opens an open forum and tells us to say what we have against her and she say what she doesn't like about us. We didn't say anything. She starts pointing at my classmates one by one, calling them immature, lacking in common sense, and even called someone stupid. She tells our class president, who literally busts his ass everyday, that choosing him as president was a mistake. Then she asks us what we want and suggests that we cut ties so she'll be nothing but a subject teacher. I say it's a good idea. It's for the best anyway, because obviously she can't handle us, and we're just as tired of her as she is of us. She just walks out.

Later, another teacher comes up and informs us that her BP was high because of us, and if something happens to her, it was our fault and that we would pay for her if she goes to the hospital.

Now complete the following example-
input: I’ve known this girl, let’s call her Sally, for about 3 years now. She used to live close to me but moved to another state for a job, but we text everyday. Throughout this time she’s graduated with a doctoral degree, went through a residency, got a job, etc. Also through all of this she has complained, incessantly, about anything and everything. She hated her residency, she hates her job, etc. I complain about my own job, too, so I can understand, but it was honestly all day, everyday.

Recently, she had a baby with a guy she knew for about 2-3 months? Since she got pregnant and had the baby, the complaining has gotten 10x worse, and it’s harder to hold my tongue. She doesn’t like something the baby daddy did, she doesn’t like his family, etc. She’s sent me video of her family fighting with the baby screaming in the background. It’s just exhausting because I’m expected to give emotional support and advice what seems like 24 hours a day. If I have any sort of issue that I complain about, she brushes it off.

Anyway, onto the wedding thing. We’re going to a mutual friend’s wedding in May and I feel like I have to continue to be civil until then, because I don’t want to ruin said friend’s wedding with any awkwardness. I just really want to end the friendship, but have no idea what to do since I have to see her in person soon. Would I be the asshole if I just kept things civil then cut off contact?

Now complete the following example-
input: Basically I'm facing a bit of an ethical dilemma and I'm pretty deep into this emotionally so who better to ask than the internet? At the core, my question is WIBTA if I were to tell the ""baby daddy"" of my ex-best friend that he is most likely not the father, and at the very least he needs to get a DNA test done to confirm it before he throws his life down the drain? Seems like an easier question, but tbh my main motivating force behind this is revenge against my best friend, so that seems....conflicting.

My best friend is in her early 20's. I'm in my 30's, and male. A bit unorthodox, but we've had a strangely open and honest, close connection since we met, the age thing never bothered either of us, so we've just gone with it. It works for us. But we are in different places of our lives obviously. She's trying to be young and free and I'm looking more to settle down. I also have things figured out a lot more and she's trying to find herself and be young and free. So she is always needing support. Sometimes financially, and I've helped her with bills before, but mostly just always being there for her, being supportive, encouraging, and helping her see herself the way I see her when she's depressed. She is not able to do a lot of these things for me; she's been surrounded by garbage people her whole life that treat her like trash so I don't think she's ever really learned how to be a good friend. But I don't need the support usually the way she does, and we've talked about it honestly with each other, and she tries, and works to be better, so it didn't seem like a big deal usually. 

Glossing over a lot of drama (cuz she always has drama), I catch feelings and fall for her. We've always been flirty since the beginning, and we've gone back and forth on the dating thing, but thru it all we've been able to talk openly and honestly with each other so we've remained best friends. She doesn't feel the same way, but has off and on had romantic feelings for me according to her and has gone back and forth on it. 

We end up having a fight (reason not too important, basically she told me she wanted to try a relationship then a week later told me she only said that to make sure I stayed her friend and so I wouldn't leave to go back on the road for work),  and she ghosts me for a couple weeks. She supposedly gets pregnant during this time with ""baby daddy"". The night of our fight tho, she had taken a pregnancy test cuz she was worried she was pregnant with a guy she had broken up with right before I got back and she wanted us to try. She had sex with him up to a couple days before the test was taken. 

I was suspicious from the beginning that it was really baby daddy's kid. She and I started talking again when she found out she was pregnant and then baby daddy ghosted her a week or two later cuz she wouldn't have an abortion. He was in college, came from a good family, and his parents saw her as white trash that was wrecking their sons life. I was a bit more distant when we started talking again cuz I felt like I could no longer trust her, but I felt bad for her situation and still cared a lot about her so I tried to help how I could. 

So we're getting back into things over the next couple months, getting very close again, and start looking for an apartment together. I still have the feelings, she's still back and forth, but I just want my best friend to have a safe, good home while she's pregnant since she's basically couch surfing at this point after getting evicted. 

So everything is good, I'm being crazy supportive again, we're having good times, I'm going to her doctors appointments with her, we're planning a home, baby daddy is nowhere to be found. Then as she's texting me pics of the place we are getting while I'm at work, she blows up about a flirty joke I send her. Says she doesn't want to be in a relationship with me, never will, and the apt is off the table. She said she only told me there was a chance between us to make me happy. It had taken a lot for her to regain my trust and I felt like our lives were moving in a good direction, she and I had talked a lot about how even if we weren't in a relationship she wanted me to be there as a male role model and doing all the pregnancy stuff with her had made me start getting really attached to the idea of having that kid around. And she knows I want kids. It doesnt help that im in love with her and we were planning a home. It was incredibly vulnerable territory for me emotionally, but i was trying to do the best i could so she was taken care of. All that was gone in the space of 20 minutes, for what I felt like was no reason. 

I asked her the next day what the hell happened. Her response is that baby daddy had shown back up, told her he loved her and wanted to be a family. I told her she was being an idiot. We tried to work things out for a day or two, but I was feeling incredibly hurt, incredibly betrayed (I already had massive trust issues she knew about), and she was dead set on never anything romantic and she couldn't see past my feelings for her. So she blocked me on everything and ghosted me. 

The other day I noticed the time stamp on a picture I had of her, worked some math in my head, and realized her supposed conception date was literally the day after she had taken her pregnancy test. I am almost 100% certain at this point it is not baby daddy's kid. I am feeling hurt beyond belief, I feel like I lost my best friend for not a very good reason at all, and I feel like she was just using me this whole time for financial and emotional support. She won't talk to me, won't talk about what happened with our mutual friends, and offers no explanation. So I'm feeling super used and betrayed. I know if this guy finds out its not his kid that he'll happily bail. He never wanted the kid in the first place and she and him had been done before she discovered she was pregnant. Telling him will blow up her world and cause her immeasurable grief. I want revenge, as petty as that sounds, for being such an incredible friend to her and always being there for her no matter what hurt it caused me, and then her dropping the friendship like it meant nothing. That would make me an asshole, but the ethical dilemma is should the ""baby daddy"" be told the truth so he knows? I would think if I was not involved that he should be told for his own happiness, but I have to admit my driving force is revenge. 

So yea, WIBTA for telling the ""baby daddy"" of my ex-best friend that it's not his kid?

Now complete the following example-
input: So this is something I've kind of struggled with for a few years. To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.

I've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.

Until this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. 

The drive home is where my memory cuts out. 

Next thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.

Honestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. 

Anyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: AITA for getting my feelings hurt for something my sick MIL is (or isn’t) doing? 

Some backstory: My BF and I have been living at my MILs house for a couple of months while the house we bought together is being renovated. About a month ago, she was having trouble breathing and went to the hospital. While at the hospital, we visited her and got her anything she needed. One day she said she wanted us to bring her pills that were by her bed to help her sleep. We bring the pills. 

Just to be sure she can take them, we checked with the doctor to make sure these pills won’t interfere with anything she’s already getting.  She was furious. Tried to rip the pills out of my boyfriends hand. Starts yelling and saying all kinds of hurtful things about my boyfriend (that she knows will bother him), that we don’t love her, and when I try to say something she tells me to leave her family alone. We end up leaving the hospital with her yelling even though the doctor told her she was approved to get the same pills but it has to given to her by the hospital. 

Fast forward to when she comes home: She keeps her distance from us. We keep our distance because there was no apology or thank you after we cleaned the whole house from top to bottom so she can come home to a clean, sterile environment.  She’s still not fully recovered or back to her old self and after a while, my boyfriend puts their differences aside and tries to be there for her. I talk to her here and there. 

One thing he’s always done and expected from me as well is kissing his mom on the cheek before we leave the house and when we come back home. I used to do it before but stopped after the whole situation. Since she’s still not back to normal, I try to start doing it again but when I kiss her on the cheek now I get the cold shoulder. She turns her head away from me and doesn’t kiss me back. You ever tried to kiss or hug someone and they obviously didn’t want it? That feeling. 

When my BF does it she kisses him back. It hurts my feelings when my kiss is obviously not wanted and so I stop doing it. It ruins my mood and my boyfriend is upset that I don’t do it anymore, that she’s sick and I should put my feelings aside. Am I the asshole?

input: My GF and I have been dating for almost a year. As of late, I really noticed that she costs a lot. I mean she goes to Starbucks every single day, eats out atleast one meal a day, etc.
Lately I’ve been blessed and have made ~$5000 this month. This information, I chose to share with GF. 
Since some time has passed, my GF has been wanting to go out and eat and do things, without realizing that I myself have things to pay for. So this lead to her wanting to go to a restaurant last night and I said I wanted to save some money before going out again.
I’ve spent $200 in the past 3 days and she has spent $30.

Whenever I say no to her she’ll say something like “u don’t hesitate to spend money and go get food with ur friends but when it comes to me you say no”... I’ve gone from feeling 100% validated, to talking to her and feeling 100% in the wrong. AITA here?

Now complete the following example-
input: So I want to start this by saying that I’m not the sort of person that does favours expecting favours, I’ll never accept any form of payment from my friends for doing them favours e.g. I used to take / pick up my friends from the city centre which would take about 60-90 minutes and cost around £3-5, I’ve seen my friends pay others £10 at minimum to get picked up by others (taxis are around £25) and I’ve never really wanted to be that guy (not that there’s anything wrong with being that guy, it’s fair to be compensated for your time &amp; cost) however these friends have been my friends since we were 12/13 &amp; others from when we were kids. 

I’ve noticed a lot of annoying behaviour from my friends such as I’ll do so much for them and help them get through daily life from things like taking them to do their food shopping, dropping or picking them up from various places and also lending them money without any interest, not a single penny.

These friends don’t pay me back on time, blow whatever money they do get or just flat out lie and that’s annoying, I wouldn’t mind if they just told me flat out “Hey man, I’m sorry I don’t have the money can I pay you another time?” Over the whole lying thing as lying really pisses me off.

Along with that the other day I was stuck in city centre as there were no trains in to where I live however I let my friends know this about 6/7 hours in advance and I got told by them that they’ll come get me and they were going out near the city centre so it wasn’t an issue for them. The time comes and they’re no where to be seen and they’re excuse was they were eating (they started queuing for a restaurant 30minute before I was going to get off the train), 45 minutes later they hadn’t even bothered to text or ring so I spent literally my last bits of money getting a taxi home. Along with this we never really go out to wherever I suggest it’s never an option and always just thrown aside &amp; I’ve got another friend who we constantly wait for because he’s constantly late and will make you wait outside his house for 10-15 minutes average before coming out of his house. 

I’ve got another set off friends who I hang around with here and there so they sell me out whenever but I’m not too frustrated at that as they’re not my main friendship circle.

All of these little things building up constantly have just left me to exhausted mentally, I can’t find it within me to really get out much and just prefer hanging out on my own and going on drives, I’ve got somewhat of a plan to further my own personal development starting 2019 too so yeah any advice would be great

Sorry for the long read! 

P.S there are a few other annoying things I’ve left out because this has gotten too long

Tl;dr - my friends never treat me how I treat them and I feel very much left out / unimportant, AITA for expecting them to treat me the same way?

Now complete the following example-
input: I’ve been with my girlfriend Lisa for 2 years. Overall she’s a good girlfriend but she’s a little controlling and really insecure. 

I have this friend Anna who I’ve known since high school who is a total smokeshow. We used to hookup but we stopped about 3 years ago. Lisa HATES Anna. She thinks that Anna acts inappropriately toward me and she’s not totally wrong but I think it’s unfair of Lisa to try to control my friendships. Anyway Lisa doesn’t know that Anna and I used to hookup so she shouldn’t have any reason to feel insecure. 

A few months ago Anna started sending me nudes over Snapchat. The first time she did it she said that she was drunk and meant to send it to someone else but I told her that I liked the picture so she started sending them to me more often. 

When she sends the nudes, I tell her that she looks sexy and sometimes I tell her what I wish I could do to her but I’ve ALWAYS made it clear that we can’t hook up because I have a girlfriend. I’ve also never sent her nudes back. 

I know Lisa wouldn’t be happy about this but it’s basically the same as porn so i didn’t think it was that bad. I haven’t hooked up with Anna since Lisa and I got together so I’m still being faithful. 

Anyway somehow Lisa found out that I’ve been sexting Anna and wants to break up with me. Idk how she found out because she won’t tell me. She says I cheated even though I explained to her that I haven’t actually done anything with Anna. 

Lisa never told me that she thought sexting was cheating or that I wasn’t allowed to do it so I think she’s being unfair by not giving me a second chance.

I know I’m not totally in the right here but I think Lisa is more wrong because she’s mad at me for something that we never decided was against the rules.  

TLDR:  Girlfriend wants to break up because I sexted a friend but I didn’t think sexting was cheating. AITA?

input: (Obligatory apology for posting on mobile) 
Ok, for context, this is not just a normal teacher. I go to a highschool where you have a ""major"" and you take some classes pertaining to that major . All of these classes are taught by the major teacher. So I've had this teacher for 2 classes last semester and 2 this semester. All that to say that I see this teacher a lot. This teacher is supposed to be your mentor.
Recently, we had a certain state competition for an event in which she was the teacher organizer. The competition went fine, or so I thought. When I came in to class today, I realized that I have my scoresheets from the judges. So I asked her to see them and she refused.
When I asked why I couldn't see them, she said that she needed to go over them with me. This teacher then proceedes to pull me in her office (in the middle of class) and ""go over them with me"". That consisted of her pointing out every point I got off and how bad I must have done to get that score (she was not there to see me perform). I asked her multiple times throughout this ""interaction"" to have a moment by myself with the scoresheets.
This was my first time seeing the scoresheets. I was extremely upset about how the judges scored me. The hardwork I put in was not enough to do well. And while I was feeling this, she proceeded to nit pick through the comments on the sheet. 
She reached a particular comment on one of the sheets that said ""[I] seemed angry"" and this teacher digs hard into that comment saying things like ""what went on in that room? You're representing this school and me, how could you seem angry!?"" When in the performance (it was a speech) I thought I was passionate. 
I snapped and told her something like, ""you don't know what it was like. You (the teacher) didn't give a shit about my speech until the day of the competition"" and then stormed out of the office and went to my next block. 
Am I the asshole?

Because of this she ended up suffering alot of injuries including her right arm ""dying"" and becoming unusable. Because of this she can't live on her own, can barely go to the bathroom on her own and has 2-3 doctor's appointments every week with a variety of different doctors.

I work 60 hour weeks and my wife is left to take care of two kids and her mother on a daily basis. Through the past two months or so my wife confessed to me that she doesn't believe she can keep up with her chronic pain acting up and her depression flaring up greatly. She feels exhausted every day and feels she cannot even put any effort into our relationship because of this.

I made the comment and she agreed to set up her mother with SSI because she is physically and mentally disabled now. Then once she gets SSI to get her set up with Medicaid so she can get assisted living and move out and have a nurse come in to her place and help take care of her.

Since bringing this up the Mother In Law claims we are being assholes and we don't love her anymore. That we are just abandoning her and trying to get rid of her so we don't have to deal with her anymore.

Now complete the following example-
input: This woman (TW for The Woman from here on out) I’m kind of familiar with had 5 cats. She posted about how she was going to have to “get rid” of one because he was terrorizing the other cats, trying to play and taking it too far. I thought he was adorable, so after a couple days I messaged her, asking about the cat. TW told me nobody had wanted him, and if she couldn’t find anyone to take him she was going to take him out to a back road and dump him. So of course I took the cat. 

Fast forward to now, almost a month later. His name is Stub and he’s an adorable,  affectionate, pain in my ass. I ended up getting a kitten for him to play with, and they get along great. :) The other day, I got a random text from TW, asking me if she could have the cat *back* because apparently, her seven year old son couldn’t accept that he’d “run away” as she’d told him, and was inconsolable about it. She claimed he was still leaving cat food out and calling the cats name in the backyard at night, and just really laid it on thick. I haven’t responded yet. I want to figure out the best way to tell her I’m not giving the cat back, no matter how much her kid cries. AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: So my roommate likes to leave things on top of the shared fridge, like pasta, bread, and snacks. We have a fridge where the freezer is on top. She left for the weekend and was in a rush and apparently just shoved all her shit on top of the fridge/freezer. She must have left some stuff on the top of the closed door of the freezer. I woke up the morning after at like 5 am to get ready for school and opened the freezer, and her container of spaghetti came falling down along with her bread and bagels. Her container is [this one](https://www.amazon.com/OXO-Good-Grips-POP-Container/dp/B000UHT0MM/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1MBTC3M17YD25&amp;keywords=tall%2Boxo%2Bcontainers&amp;qid=1548183589&amp;sprefix=tall%2Boxo%2B%2Caps%2C290&amp;sr=8-2&amp;th=1) . It broke on the bottom, just a small hole on the corner, still usable lid and stuff just a busted bottom portion.

I texted her after I did it letting her know that I broke it and she said it was fine. Today, about a week after it broke, she comes in my room and asks for money to replace the container. I was confused because she didn't seem too irritated by it before but she said the containers are expensive (they are, who the fuck pays $15 for a plastic bin and lid?) so I should pay her back.

I said I don't think I should have to pay for it because she left the container in a precarious location and I didn't do anything wrong to have caused it to be broken. She said I should have checked the top of the freezer before opening it, but that's kind of ridiculous to think to do at 5 am and also I'm 5'2"" so I can't really see the top of the freezer anyway. I also said she could just tape the hole closed on the container and it would still be usable. So now she's off in a huff and called me a cheapskate. Honestly I'll give her the cash if I'm the asshole here but I legit think no one is really in the wrong here, so I shouldn't have to pay.

AITA? 

Tl;Dr: Roommate left her $15 pasta container on top of the freezer and it fell when I opened it. I don't think I should have to pay because she is the one who left it in a dangerous spot and the container is still usable with mild repair. AITA?

I've since then have asked her multiple times to not look at my phone, which she didn't listen to and looked anyway.

input: So me and my sister were at a holiday resort and there were 2 elephants in an enclosure. 
It was late at night and I saw that the elephants were swaying their trunks and sort of “dancing”. I quickly recognized that they were probably hungry and this was their ‘day job’ to entertain guests at the resort. 

It seemed like they were dancing for us to beg for food; it seemed like they were hungry to me. I had no elephant food on me but I saw that their keeper had left some elephant food (sugar cane) nearby, and no one else was around. My sister was telling me not to feed them because “they’ll just end up hungrier tomorrow night when we’re gone”. 

However I fed the elephants anyway and they gobbled up the sugar cane. We kept arguing about it the entire time back to our rooms. 

So AITA for giving those elephants food without permission?

Now complete the following example-
input: Throwaway account for obvious reasons, and a heads up that the situation is a little weird.

Long story short, I’m living with two women I’ve known my whole life, they’re married, and I’m dating both of them. Everyone knows, there’s no secrets, no cheating, none of that. 

But before we became a triangle, they would basically have weekly date nights where they’d go to the movies. They’d see literally everything. I see less movies these days, mostly because I feel like I’m turning into a bit of a snob, or maybe I’m just less willing to put my money into movies I just know I’m not into.

The exception is animated movies. I see basically all of them, and even if I know they’re bad (less than 30 on Rotten Tomatoes bad), I might see it if I’m bored and they aren’t interested.

How to Train Your Dragon just came out, and I’ve been on a new work schedule for a few months now. I work seven days, 12 hour shifts, then I’m off seven days. Naturally it makes seeing movies that come out on the week I work difficult, so there’s a bit of a wait on some of them. I told them they could see HOTYD without me, then a few hours later after really giving it some thought, I said I’d rather they wait. It’d only be a 4-5 day wait, but they went and saw it.

Of course we can always see it again since they liked it enough that they’d be willing to, but for whatever reason I’ve always preferred to see movies I know I want to see with them for the first time for all of us. It’s caused issues in the past, and they know I’m upset about it now, and one of them told me ‘You always get angry about this kind of thing, and we feel like we’re not allowed to see a movie without your permission.’

I know I’m at least partially the asshole, at least because I attempted to rescind the permission to see the movie but if they know it bothers me because this has happened before shouldn’t they be able to  see that maybe if they’re doing something that upsets me that maybe they should stop doing it? I’m not trying to control the movies they see, but for the movies all of us want to see that they know are a must see for me, is it too much of me to ask them to wait a few days?

input: My sister has a 7 year old chihuahua that pees and poops everywhere. Ive tried talking to her, asking her to take him out more or keep him in her room. All this has sparked was an attitude from her, and she does nothing to change it. 
He pees everywhere in the house. The walls. Shits and pees on the couch. The carpet. Theres literaly not a DAY that doesnt pass by where this isnt pee (im really not joking. There can be up to three puddles a day and they completely ignore it expecting someone else to clean it up)

&amp; its not like they dont have time to clean it up or take him out? She goes outside on the porch to smoke 5x+ a day but she still doesnt let him out, even if hes whining at the door.

Ive witnessed her blame it on MY dog (medium sized shiba inh, LARGER poop than a chihuahua &amp; i walk him DAILY. even if he does go i pick it up as soon as i see it), Ive seen her just leave it there for MONTHS (literal MONTHS. not exaggerating). She had a teenage daughter that could let it out in the morning and afternoon but she doesnt. I feel bad for the dog because its just decoration to them at this point. 

Obviously, I already know some people are gonna recommend i take him out myself. I just wanna say that im absolutely NOT going to do this. Its their dog, Its not my responsibilty? Why get a dog if you arent gonna take care of it?  I feel like if i take care of him for them it just reinforces the behavior that they dont have to take care of him at all. Thsy have no care for the fact everything smells like shit and piss and dont care about cleaning it up AT ALL. Theres literally a puddle of pee on a suitcase near the couch thats been there for a week. Im sick of cleaning up after them. 

Hes not registered under a vet. Has has no shots. Eats out of my pets dog bowl.

Now complete the following example-
input: Going to try writing my first post as objectively as possible.Please bear with me.

Some back story: My brother is in his last year of University and has vehemently wanted to own a car for reasons that are pretty legit but I may not agree with. Some of the bigger reasons are how public transports are wasting his time(takes about an hour-ish), he can drive grab (a taxi service) to earn and pay for the car as well. Why I don't agree is because I've always felt that having a car is a luxury and where I'm from, public transport is convenient and ALOT cheaper compared to owning a car so it really is a debt to have before you even start a real job. And lots of working adults at my age can't even afford one. So letting him know my stance and advise was against his, i still trusted him enough to loan him money for a second hand car. (he wanted a first hand car initially) 

Also.. a very crucial point in this AITA post. I've always felt like my mum dotes on him more than me. If i hadn't stepped in to loan him the money, she would have ""loaned"" him the money a 100% and she would not have expected him to pay her back. At the same time she would always be seeking help from me for her financial issue that she never fully shows me full disclosure about. 

I don't have anything to gain by loaning my brother the money except the satisfaction of knowing he has to pay the money which in itself is a lesson worth learning isn't it? And also helping my mum to ease whatever financial issue that she seems to have or not have? or i guess some people just likes to scream poor. 

He has failed to pay me twice and i've told him that 3rd strike he's out cause he clearly can't afford a car. 

And today I happened to see a text from him on my mum's phone asking her to transfer money to him so he could pay me. I felt betrayed and upset that they were doing this behind my back. ( I already found out that she pays gas for him without letting me know).

So i confronted him with that text and told him i was disappointed in him and i could not longer loan him the money.

He replied me that exams were around the corner, he had some taxes to pay and there were big holidays during the month so he couldn't earn enough for the month's payment. And he apologized for not telling me because he was afraid I would be angry. ):

&amp;#x200B;

I was upset about the betrayal by both but hearing his apology made me wonder AITA if i were to stop loaning him the money?

input: So, it all started last summer when I asked out this girl, A, and got rejected: no big deal. However, from there we started texting and meeting up, and became good friends, completely platonically. (all of my friends know this)

This year I discovered that me and a girl, B, both have feelings for each other, which was cool. A few days ago however, A asked if I wanted to meet up on Thursday (not as a valentine, it's just we were both free that day.)

Today, I mentioned in passing to a ""friend"", C, my plans for Thursday, (Keep in mind that I had had no contact with B, and had definitely not been asked to do anything on valentines by her,) and was told that I was being stupid by C, and that B would be angry. I took it with a pinch of salt, as he is one of B's close friends, and want us to get together, but not before asking him not to tell her, to which he promised. I pretty much ignored it until a few hours later, when mutual friends all begin to chime in, supporting C. I asked C how they knew, and he told me that he had ""accidentally"" told them. (I later discovered that he had immediately pulled B aside and told her upon seeing her, and had gone on to tell others in the group.) Just now however, he sent me a screenshot of a conversation he'd had with B, where she mentioned that she'd be ""fuming"" if she had found out any later, or from someone else. In my opinion, she, and C, had no right to be upset at all, and my meeting A will have no bearing on any interactions that I might have with B in the future, yet judging by my friends reactions, I feel like I'm missing something. So, AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input:  

Throwaway here because people know my regular account. 

I’m getting married in June. I’m going to have my friend Jim as my dude of honor, and my friend Jane as my bridesmaid. 

Jim and I have been friends since college, but my friendship with Jane is longer and a bit more complicated.

We started to be friends in high school where we were friends with two other girls (they’ll be important later). Typical teenager and 20 something drama happened, and I’m not close with the two other girls anymore. One straight up said she didn’t want to be friends with me anymore, and I guess the other friend just followed her lead. I’ll admit that Jane and I used to be closer when we were younger, and we drifted apart but I still considered her a close friend.

When I got engaged I asked Jane to be my bridesmaid. When I asked she was kind of hesitant. She was engaged too and said we’d probably be planning weddings at the same time and she was worried she wouldn’t be able to devote a lot of time to my wedding. I told her it was going to be super laidback and she wouldn’t have to do much and that I wanted her there, so she agreed. 

Planning the wedding has had its own ups and downs (lots of drama from family), but Jane has been a good enough bridesmaid. My friend Jim has been planning my bachelorette, and they both went to see me get my veil. I think she could stand to be a bit more involved, but considering distance and time she’s doing enough. 

When Jane first got engaged, she wasn’t even sure if wanted to have a traditional wedding. She was talking about doing something really small and only inviting immediate family and close friends. It turns out that she actually is going to have a ceremony and reception in the fall. 

I awkwardly found out over dinner after pushing her for wedding details that she was planning on having bridesmaids, and I wasn’t one of them. She claimed it was because I live far away (not really, we live on different cities on the east coast and are about a train ride away) and she didn’t want to bother me because I’d be busy with my wedding and marriage. 

To make matters worse, the two girls I had a falling out with are of course in the wedding. 

It hurts so much since I assumed we’d all be together during our weddings. I’m hurt. Jane and I went through a lot together and I really wanted her to be a part of my wedding. I’m hurt that she doesn’t feel the same way. 

When I told my mom she was shocked and said how rude Jane was. My fiancé said it was okay to feel hurt and that it was a dick move, but that Jane also has a right to have whoever she wants in her wedding party.

Am I wrong for feeling like this? Should I confront her? I don’t even know if I want her in my wedding anymore.

Now complete the following example-
input: My first post and I'm on a mobile so apologies if the formatting is wrong.

So I'll start off by saying that I have never and would never cheat on my boyfriend, so in a way this whole thing is pointlessly hypothetical, but it's still been bothering me. We've been together for over a year and are both in our early twenties. He's always had trust issues, mainly due to low self-esteem which wasn't helped when his last (long term) girlfriend left him for someone else.

So basically the other day he told me that if I cheated on him he'd revenge-cheat on me. He's mentioned this before but it was a lot earlier in our relationship so I kinda figured the more he grew to care about me the less this would be an issue. Apparently not. I'm hurt that he's the kind of person who would want to hurt me, even if I hurt him. If he cheated on me, I'd be distraught, but I'd never do anything to hurt him because I love him. I kinda feel it should be the same for him. I'm also hurt that he even considers the possibility that I'd cheat on him, because I never would.

Just a bit of background regarding our relationship, I'm not sure how relevant it is. When I first started going out with him I was already in love with someone else, unreciprocated, and I'd never made any attempt to be with this person either before or during my relationship with my boyfriend, so it was merely an internal struggle of mine. He found out about this and was extremely hurt that I hadn't told him about this when we first got together. We hadn't even said the L word to each other at this point. This, I think, has made him trust me less than he otherwise would.

  BUT am I the asshole for not wanting to leave my wife despite me not really being happy? Getting a divorce would absolutely destroy my life (I'd more than likely loose my kids because of the nature of my job/ We'd all be financially fucked)
 We both know that our marriage is not great, we recognize that but usually put it on the back burner because we're so busy. Plus, due to her upbringing she's not  really supportive of the idea of divorce. 
  But We argue constantly, nothing dramatic just consistent. We've both kind of let ourselves go and I find myself looking elsewhere. I'm sure she does to. 
  I understand that having kids exposed to this type of relationship isn't ideal however I took this job and moved our family to a different part of the country to a much worse environment in the first place; us getting a divorce would only lead to her taking them back.
 I also understand that being in a marriage with someone and not being happy with it isn't a good situation for either of us but sacrificing my kids well being and stability for some abstract idea of 'happiness' seems like a terrible idea.

input: If there needs to be any clarification, please ask in the comments. 

So, yesterday, I F(17) went on a dinner date with a boy (M17) will call Gary for the sake of anonymity. He was really sweet and just seemed like a genuinely good kid and was very respectful. Thing is, I agreed to go on the date to give him a chance, I think that’s kinda the point of a first date. Regardless, I just don’t find Gary physically attractive. I just seen him more as a friend than someone I’d be interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with. He asked me on a second date afterwards, and I told him I wasn’t sure and I would definitely get back to him with my decision within a couple days.

Here’s the predicament: Prom is this Saturday and I don’t have a date. That, on it’s own, doesn’t matter, because I’m perfectly content with going with friends and without a date. However, Gary does online school, and thus will never have a prom to go to. I would love to invite him to be my date, but I don’t want to look (or feel) like I’m using him. He seemed down when he mentioned he would never have a prom, and part of me feels like it would be fun for both of us. BUT, I’m 90% sure I do not want to pursue a romantic relationship with him. 

Would I be the asshole if I invited Gary to Prom with me, even though I don’t have intention of dating him?

We took his keys and all that and we thought everything was good. Well about 3 weeks ago I found a juul pod in a pair of shorts. I haven’t seen him wear these shorts in a long time and they were stuffed under his bed so I figured it may have been from when he got caught before. Just to be safe I bought a nicotine urine test and tested one morning when he forgot to flush and he tested positive. We had a talk and he ended up lying at first then told the truth once I told him I tested him. I took his PS4 from his sisters and I’ve never seen him this mad. He keeps insisting that I couldn’t take it because he paid for it and it wasn’t in our house, etc... I told him to get it back he needed a job and needed to pass a nicotine test. It’s been a week and he has a job but hasn’t passed the test. He destroyed the juul and gave it to me but I’m waiting for the nicotine test to test negative. It seems that we just argue every day and it gets worse. He’s never been mad for this long. AITA?

input: I live with two roommates. Because of my schedule and training, I often eat at unusual times and thus cook for myself (I would ask them if they want some as well, but I know the answer from experience). Recently they and another common friend got mad about it saying I was being wasteful and egoistic. The thing is, I pay for 90% of the food because I don't want to eat the crap they would buy (canned vegetables/packaged meat) and I want to eat in a way that doesn't affect my training and schedule negatively (no food 2h before training and eating within 1 hour after training). I know one of them is quite the environmentalist, but I really don't care about his politics when it comes to my personal life. Besides, we'd just cook more together, essentially using the same amount of resources except for the electricity for the stove. AITA for living my own life?

input: Throwaway.

I met a girl at an event I was helping out with, and we had a pretty good conversation (surprising for me, since I'm normally an awkward gal.) It was all going so well and I thought I'd made a new friend, but then not even an hour into the conversation she asks me if I'd like to join a 'motivational course'. I'm like oh cool, that sounds good and then she tells me it costs about £1,000.

Like, dude. How can you try and sell a £1000 program on someone you've literally just met? I felt like I've been MLM-ed. Not only that, I'm a student, so I don't have that kind of money around. I jokingly say this and she goes 'oh it's cool, you can pay in instalments over a year.' So great, I get to go into debt?

Now, to be fair, she seemed like she was genuinely pushing a motivational course (for those who think it might be some sort of MLM thing) because she could give quite a lot of details on the course (unfortunately I've forgotten the name) and what they have to do on it and how its structured. She also seemed genuinely passionate about it. But it just really soured everything for me- I thought that either there's some kind of benefits for her to recruit others, or else this is some kind of culty thing that they're recruiting for. So later, I deleted my number off her phone when she wasn't looking, because she said she was going to contact me 'so we could go together'. AITA? I feel a bit like one, because it was her phone and I did willingly give the number, and I felt like I should have been a lot more upfront about not wanting to join the program instead of just going 'mm-hmm, interesting.'

Now complete the following example-
input: No matter how this ends, it's gonna be awkward because one of the friends is my college roommate. Also, this is my first post so here goes. I've been annoyed by how often my roommate rants about even the most slightly controversial things (she's always been doing this somewhat regularly but it's been daily since last week). For example, last night, my friends and I were watching a movie and there was a scene where a woman takes off her bra but her breasts weren't on-screen (the movie was rated PG-13) and she whined for a solid 5 minutes about how sexualized breasts are and that they should be revered as ""life-giving and sacred,"" then ended it with how bras are ""designed by men to oppose women/women should 'free their nipples.'"" She does this with other things she sees and reads about, and although she's entitled to her own opinion, I hate how out-of-the-blue and constant it is. Every time I try to counter her with an opposing opinion or become visibly irritated, everyone calls me rude. I just think they're overreacting. The fact that I'm never taken seriously since I don't talk and act like they do has bothered me since day one, but I kept my mouth shut about it since they're--apparently--good people. 
It doesn't end here though because what really set me off was another one of my friends saying that everyone in Wisconsin is racist--and they all know that I was born and raised in Wisconsin. I then explained that from personal experience, that's not true, but they ignored me anyway. Overall, they claim to be accepting but treat me like I'm from another planet and aren't afraid to personally offend me when I'm right in front of them. I've been considering drifting away from them and making some other friends instead, yet I'm afraid to at the same time since I need to pick my roommate for sophomore year next month. Am I as inconsiderate as they say I am, or am I just a bad friend?

input: So to make a long story short a friend and I got into a new friend group consisting of about 6 people. Almost instantly i hit it of with 2 of the women in the group and i started to hang out with them alone and not only within the group of friends. Ive even developed a huge crush on one of them that i let my original friend know about.

Almost a couple weeks after telling him my friend started to act differently. He inserted himself into conversations i was having with these two girls, started to speak to them alot more which i was conpletely fine with. Then his behavior changed even more. He became very white-knighty trying to do everything their way and really just trying to get their attention. It was nice in the begining but its developed into a huge annoyance when he goes out of his way to please them or to be liked by them. This personality he puts on in front of them isnt his real self, its completely fake and its really difficult for me to see him act fake in front of our mutual friends, or to try that hard to be likeable and not the person he is in reality (which is the guy ive been friends with and know since we were 4.)

Recently ive thought about confronting him about the situation and explaining what i feel is happening but i dont know if im just jealous because of one of the two girls or if everything is as i make it out to be. AITA?

But I'm not sure if we'll go that frequently tbh. We live kinda far and rarely do much on the weekends. It seemed too pricey to spend on something I may not use with my current financial situation. I explained this and he understood. Then my friend suggested seeing Wicked next weekend. I was so excited as I've always wanted to see it. It costs around the same amount and I told my bf I was thinking about going. He got upset because he thought I was too broke to get the passes for Knotts. He said ""you didn't have the money to go to Knotts but suddenly you have the money when it's something YOU want."" I didn't know what to say. I didn't ask him to go as I know he doesn't like musicals and I'm okay with going with just my friends. I haven't confirmed that I want to go yet.

input: My girlfriend (long distance) and I have been dating for 6 months now and talking over over a year. She doesn't live in the states and doesn't have daylight savings so she doesn't fully understand it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I wakeup at 8AM and we call and chat for about 2 hours almost everyday. Well yesterday I had my alarm set for 8AM as usual and wakeup to call my girlfriend who is angry at me because I ""woke up late"". Now mind you my phones clock adjusts automatically and I had no idea that today was daylight savings day. Nothing alerted me at all.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as I realized I told her that it must have been daylight savings and I had no idea, my clock adjusts on its own and that it was an accident. She is claiming things like ""how could you not know? did you not feel like you slept too long?"". Well the answer is no, I don't know if that's a normal thing or not? Are people able to tell if they over slept an hour? I sure can't...infact I have sleep apnea and feel like nomatter how long I sleep, I never get enough..which she knows this but thinks I use it as an excuse and over-exaggerate it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm not trying to paint a bad picture of my girlfriend...there are times I've woken up late or fallen asleep after waking up on accident..I totally get it annoys her even if its not done on purpose..so for this to happen again I get that she's angry about it..but I had no idea it was daylight savings!! I tried explaining but she just says I'm ""trying to reason out""!

&amp;#x200B;

I told her I couldn't argue about this tonight (since she wouldnt call me today and we didn't talk since) and that I wouldn't want to entertain the argument when I already stated it was an accident and I didn't do it on purpose. I just told her goodnight because she thinks I'm being an ass for calling her out and thinking shes being ridiculous..so I just muted my phone now and will be listening to what you guys think.

&amp;#x200B;

Now complete the following example-
input: My sister wants to get a second dog. My sister and I both still live with my mom, she's turning 20 soon and I'm 18. We have a few pets, namely a cat, dog and a few fish. The cat and dog are just kinda ""the family's"" but the fish are bought and kept by my sister.

&amp;#x200B;

You have to understand where I am coming from. I love dogs and cats, but my dog is the light of my life. The one we currently have is called Marvin, and we've had him for six years. This dog is everything to me. I'm a huge introvert and due to having to move a lot of times throughout my childhood, hopping between schools and such I haven't got many friends. Most of my friends I only see online, and the only times I go outside are to go to the store and to walk my dog. So this dog has helped me through some rough times.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday my sister and my mom were both downstairs. I went downstairs to grab a drink when my mom says something about how my sister was in a predicament. My mom wanted to hear what I had to say, but my sister seemed less eager to hear my thoughts. My mom told me that my sister was gonna get a second dog with her own money, and if I thought the dog looked cute. Now, I was kind of tired and generally speaking not thinking too hard so I simply shrugged and said ""yeah it's pretty cool"" and kept walking.

&amp;#x200B;

It's only when I got back to my room and sat down that I actually thought about it. And then it hit me, I really don't think this is cool at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, we live in a duplex apartment. We aren't poor, we could probably sustain two dogs although it would cut things kind of tight. As for myself... I just can't. I hate the idea of another dog in the house. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's mostly just the fact that I'll have to get to like this second dog, and I know I won't. My first dog, it clicked instantly. But a second dog? I just don't have room for that. And since I spend most of the day at home, and walk the dog most of the time, I just feel like I can't get myself to care. No matter how hard I try. 

&amp;#x200B;

Worst case scenario: The two dogs hate each other. In which case we just brought an actual invader into our home. If the new dog is a piece of shit then I will probably grow to hate it, as I love my current dog too much. If the dog is actually nice and friendly, the two will become inseparable. This will basically mean that by default if I wanna spend more time with our current dog I better start liking this new dog too. Then there's also the fact that I doubt my sister can care for the dog properly. She barely cleans the fishtank enough times, let alone something as fragile as a dog in an apartment. Our cat won't like it either, and just in general the time and effort it'll take to get used to this new dog will just be too much. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I told my sister I hated the idea of getting another dog in the house, we had a debate about it. She ended up calling me selfish and saying that I'm not the only one living in this house. She told me she had been planning this since 2018, and wasn't gonna give up on it now. This was my boiling point, and I didn't really wanna have a massive fight with my own family so I just gave up and continued with my day. The reason why this comment pissed me off so much is cause of how inconsiderate it feels. She's the one who wants to bring a new dog. She's the one who's forcing everyone else in the house to adapt. And she never decided to tell me anything about it. All just because she wants another dog.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know why she wants another dog so badly, and I'm not about to ask as it'll probably lead nowhere. I really just don't know, am I being selfish? I hope this whole situation fits here.

Now complete the following example-
input: To begin, he doesn't actually ask my permission to have guests over or even warn me or the other tenant. I signed the lease with him and my best friend of 6 years (31M) 1/1/2019. Since then we have lived 5 full weeks with his girlfriend and his male friend who do not pay rent (aren't on the lease) or help around the house. Me and the other tenant want to talk to him but don't know how to approach it since his guests are still around.

&amp;#x200B;

A little context, we are not perfect roommates either. He has complained to me about dishes not being done. Totally understandable! No problem! and we have immediately cleaned them if he is cooking and often times its just a dish or two my friend or I have overlooked but still should not be an on going thing. During this cleaning session he passive aggressively told us that if he complains to management about us 3 times we will be kicked out even though we pay $2,600 a month and he pays $1,200. My fear is bringing up this issue to him and having our living space become uncomfortable. So far we have not used the kitchen in 6 weeks out of fear of his complaints.

&amp;#x200B;

Along with this he throws parties. Loud weekday parties. I work at 7 am and have to wake up at 5 am every day on the weekdays. I get the sense that he is lonely. I want him to feel free to do as he pleases but I am quiet and have to go to bed at 7-8 pm (i have a hard time sleeping a full 8 hours). I told him this before signing the lease with him and he told us this wasn't an issue because he worked ""nights"". This turned out to be untrue. Since then he has taken vacation from work for some reason, gotten hair plugs and stays home all day complaining to us about how loud we shut our doors because his ears are sensitive to sound due to the hair plug procedure.

&amp;#x200B;

I do NOT want to get a lawyer or do something crazy or hostile until I can figure out how to approach this. I just want to have a discussion about it with him. In fact, if I haven't already expressed it the other tenant isn't okay with it either and has had multiple discussions with me about his girlfriend blocking the driveway, basically living with us with out paying any rent and finding random strangers just walking about. I'd like to note that he makes close to 100k which is much more than what I or my friend/other tenant make separately. We pay rent each month on time and have no issue paying but the reason I mention this is because we know he doesn't need financial support from his friends/gf to split his portion of the rent. He just likes having guests over. My theory is its a cultural thing, he is Indian and moved to America about 8 years ago. idk? 

What should I do? AITA

Should I be okay with this?

Now complete the following example-
input: I like to think I'm right on this one, but posting to make sure I'm not missing anything. My son is 13, and his middle school is currently in off-season after their first year of football. He doesn't plan to join the team next year, because he's not as good as others, but he still loves to play along with other sports with friends. For the longest time, the wife and I didn't really give it much attention. Growing up, I played the same way, and the worst I came out with were a couple of fingers dislocating and a sprained knee. Some friends had it worse, but I guess I never considered my son's health until recently.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that he and his friends play tackle football without any pads or proper equipment every weekend. I got a call this past weekend from my son asking about an emergency. Some of them wear cleats (spiked shoes for better traction), and somehow, one of his friends got stepped on face first by the cleats and was bleeding like no other. He ended up going to the ER and getting stitches, but it certainly made me realize that playing tackle football without any protection can lead to far worse things. I know there's been a lot of discussion about concussions and I feel like that is only more expected if you're not wearing helmets.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, I told my son he can't play tackle football anymore. I'm fine if he and his friends want to play flag football, but my son started giving a huge fit. Got into an argument, told me he hates me, says how its unfair because I used to play without pads back in the day,how his friends are still planning to play next week,  etc. My son has been radio silent with me and only talking with my wife. My wife is on my side, but she's playing the good cop in this situation so that he is communicating with one of us. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I offered a good alternative to play flag football. It's actually something I still play with some co-workers and it's great. But I just want to know if I made a mistake?

Now complete the following example-
input: My mother remarried when I was 18 after being a single mother for years. I'm 32 now.

Recently my mother decided that my choice of spouse and my spouse's religion did not align with her expectations, so she cut me out of her life last winter.

Fwiw, she's sent a few texts saying she loves me, but also refuses to apologize for her actions. She also thinks I'm being disrespectful for standing up for my partner's freedom to believe what she will. 

The only reason I ever talked to her husband is that I'd go visit every few months. When I was younger he asked me to go hunting with him, but I didn't really enjoy it. 

His mother passed away a few years ago and he asked me to attend the funeral. I did - I even filled in as a pallbearer because one dude had a back injury.  I felt super uncomfortable doing that because I had never met his mother. And now I'm a pallbearer at her  funeral. Apparently he insisted to his brothers that I do it because he saw me as “her grandson.” I didn't want to make a fuss at this poor woman's funeral, so I went along with it.

Now that my mother disowned me, I haven't visited or contacted him. He texted asking if he had done something wrong to make me push him away, and I basically told him what I'm writing here now. He's an okay dude, but we don't really have anything in common.  And with my mother freezing me out, I don't feel like navigating the complicated politics of him, her, and me. Even if we keep our contacts brief and relatively discreet. Ain't got time for that lol.

I felt bad about it, but I've been reflecting on just how much I've bent backwards to accommodate his “son I never had” fantasy. I've no interest in a surrogate father figure, and I've no interest in helping him live out his fatherhood fantasies. He has a daughter - age 36 - that he never really spent time with either and never fully acknowledged.  

Plus, he once tried to extort my mother out of $100,000. He asked for a divorce and said $100,000 would get him to go away quietly. This was years ago an apparently they figured it out. But still, once bitten twice why, right?

So. AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: In my country women greet anyone and everyone with a hug and kiss on the cheek (mostly cheeks touching and making a kiss noise). Men get to shake hands with each other but greet women this way. 

When I was little, this wasn't a problem because kids aren't expected to do so. But when I turned about 14, the time had come when I had to engage in this social practice.

I have never been a touchy person. I hate physical contact even with close family. With close family it does not at all gross me out. It's just a little awkward. But with strangers it absolutely disgusts me. 

I try to not be rude and greet people the traditional way but their faces are faces and therefore often sweaty, smelly, greasy, etc. I guess I don't hide it well often and people just don't get that I don't like it. And some will even get mad at me and complain to my parents if they are present (even though I'm 19) that I am a disrespectful child and whatnot.

I have tried shaking their hand politely as a man would but they ignore this and squeeze me (specially women which makes me accidentally touch their breasts and makes it even grosser). 

AITA for not complying to my own culture? I know I'm rude, but come on! Does any one of you want to press their faces against a stranger's?

input: I am a law abiding citizen, always have been and always will be. However, I do have a friend who has been involved in aspects of organised crime and met up with him about a month ago. 

I am aware that he has been involved in certain criminal activities, processing goods and such. It is not my business and I have never pryed further.  Although, I stay on the side of the law, I have no great regard for the police and no certainly desire to aid them. 

So recently, my friend shows me a picture of the group he hangs out with (they did a paint balling session). One of the faces I recognise, as I have organised deliveries (I am involved with logistics) as being a police officer. 

I tell my friend this, and say that it seems somehow a police officer has got into their group and say nothing more. Maybe, the cop is just a friend and not undercover but I feel my friend should be informed. 

My friend is surprised but thanks me for the information. We leave and won't see each other again till next Spring. 

Since, I am not involved in organised crime or any crime in fact. I see this as just one friend informing another and nothing more.

Now complete the following example-
input: This has been something I constantly ask myself and I’m sure other people have felt the same so hopefully this can be relatable to some people. 

I’ll start with how I know I’m a generous person because I love my friends and family and am always looking for ways to help the people in my life. I constantly want to give to everyone so they can be happy and also I just love gift giving. I don’t really have to buy friendships, so it doesn’t feel like that. It’s more of like when I want to buy drinks for a friend or give a person I care about a small gift or just simple little things. Sometimes though, I tend to draw myself back because I feel like people notice this and want to take advantage of it.

One time in particular, a friend had came in from out of town and gotten his car towed. He expressed how he’d be in so much debt and wouldn’t be able to get it out so I offered to help find other solutions. The easiest and quickest solution was to bail his car out then and there, so I told him not to worry about it right away and just pay me back when he can. It’s been almost 8 months and I don’t think I’m gonna see that $300 ever again.

Another is more recently and slightly different, I’ve let a friend stay at my house for about a half week since they’ve been in a difficult situation. They also don’t have a car so I had to drive them to work for a few days as well. I didn’t mind this and they said they’d pay me back in any way they can (buying me drinks or giving me cigs) which was totally okay with me. But when I asked for those things (for instance, just asking if they could buy me a drink when I see them out) they acted like I would owe THEM for it now.

So in conclusion, should I feel bad for asking for my money back? Should I feel like a dick because, even though I give a lot, people never want to return it? 

I know the simple answer here is stop being nice to people that don’t deserve it. But sometimes it’s more difficult than that. I just want to not feel like I owe people things after all that I’ve given them.

I hope some people can relate to this in some way, and thanks in advance to anyone reading

input: This is probably better in r/parenting but here it is anyhow. My son is 2 and a half, and he likes to arrange his toy cars in a neat row. He gets VERY angry when you move a car out of line, and so I generally try to respect “his” toys and leave them be. 

Anyway, he had a bunch of flash cards (numbers, alphabet, etc) and they were in a big messy pile. I was sorting them out while he was playing in the room with me (with other toys) when he came over to look at what I was doing. I could tell he wanted to mess up my neat piles, so I asked him very politely and seriously not to mess up my piles. He got a mischievous look on his face and then batted all the cards all over the room. I got up, walked over to his cars, and said “I asked you not to mess up my cards, and you did it anyway, so now I’m gonna mess up your cars” and I calmly scattered them all around. He flipped out and started crying, and I explained to him that if he wants people to respect his things, he needs to be nice to other people too.

I was trying to use this as a teaching moment for him, but I honestly just feel bad about the whole thing in hindsight and wonder if I made the right move. In the moment, I felt like it was the most appropriate way of teaching a toddler, since his language and comprehension skills are not completely developed yet. AITA for going the “eye for an eye” route with him?

When a movie we both want to watch hits one of those media sources, I always suggest we watch it together when we have time. I almost always get the same answer from my wife where she does not want to watch it right now. Her reasoning for this is she finds the two hours for most movies is to much of a commitment, but then will watch 3 hours of crap TV.

input: My boyfriend (well just call him M) and I are creators on Instagram (he is also on TikTok). I'm a digital and traditional artist and in one of my classes we create t shirts and things (socks, lanyards, water bottles, stickers, you name it).

Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

input: I really don’t think they are that small but she believes she has super small boobs. I admit, they aren’t big nor medium but I think it’s perfect. I never really liked and implants of any sort, but especially when it came to breasts. 
To me, they look odd and too “perfectly” round. They are just fake balloons and don’t feel anything like a real boob. Plus the scars. 
We were having a discussion a month ago about it and she asked if I would find her just as attractive. I didn’t want to lie to her. I told her I would still love her but I wouldn’t find it a little unsettling. I didn’t want to lie to her and have her get a boob job only to come back not getting the smile she expected from me. 
Most of my friends acted surprised and told me fake “tits” are awesome. I never liked fake boobs but I somehow feel a little bad for telling my girlfriend my opinion.

Now complete the following example-
input: Some back story: my girl had a really rough life until she was 14 and finally came to live with us. I've known her since she was 7 because I lived with her mother and we were both heroin addicts. There's a whole lot of back story so I'm not gonna get into it, but I realised how shitty of a person her mother was and separated myself from her, but I ended up meeting my stepdaughters father about 9 years ago and we've been together almost 7 years. My girl ended up in foster care and cys (children and youth services) never even tried to contact her father and when we finally found out where she was he had to fight for a year to get her. She had a lot of issues at first, the worst of it was the pathological and compulsive lying, but then came the boys. I don't totally blame her, her mother was horrible and slept with anyone she could. Now she's 19 and she has this boyfriend who is abusive, physically and emotionally. She has cheated on him multiple times with multiple different people, so she's not innocent either. The kid isn't allowed here because he has no respect for our rules and she lies to us constantly ""oh brandy is picking me up"" like I don't look out the window and see it's this little asshole. She started college and she met a kid who's a really good guy and she's basically using him for his car, I think she does care about him, but as soon as the good kid leaves, she's getting picked up by ""brandy"". This kid is legitimately crazy, he drives past our house on a regular basis, when he was allowed here he would pinch her/slap her over and over again until she finally defended herself and he would gaslight her into feeling bad that she hurt him back. He would constantly be trying to get in her pants right on our couch and it definitely worked at least once because my husbands blanket was on the couch and I went to get it and there was fucking sperm on it. That's when we decided he's not allowed here anymore. Last week she told me she was getting picked up by ""brandy"" and usually before she leaves she'll tell me she's going and we say our I love  you's but she didn't that day so I went and looked out the window, sure as shit she's getting picked up by that fuck bag, literally an hour after the other kid left. I stewed over this for a couple of days until she said something about getting picked up by a female friend and I said something along the lines of ""oh, does this one have facial hair too?"" And she totally freaked. Saying that she's acting like her mother and no one believes a word that comes out of her mouth was probably a bit much, I do feel bad about it, but we have no idea what to do! We've gone about it every which way we can, including telling her if she's going to continue seeing that asshole, we just don't wanna hear about him or the drama that comes with him. I've asked her repeatedly not to lie to me about who's picking her up, don't say a name or anything, just say ""Hey I'm going out I'll be back later"" it's the lying that pisses me off. I know she has to make her own choices and mistakes, so I don't tell her what to do, just give advice if she asks for it. I'm her mom, she is MY daughter and we love each other. I told her I was sorry for what I said and we've made up. Please someone give me some advice on any aspect of this, even tell me I'm an asshole if that's your opinion. We just don't know what to do.

Now complete the following example-
input: So I have this girl added on Snapchat that lives a couple towns away from me, she was very nice and we talk everyday, we had a 9 day Snapchat streak, because we talked everyday. So I work overnight, and she works in the afternoon so as far as seeing each other goes we barely can, but we both were off yesterday which was Thursday AKA Valentine's day

so this whole week we were talking about meeting up to go get some ramen noodles on Valentine's day, and we agreed for 4 p.m. there was a state of emergency in my state 2 days ago that made it so my dough didn't ship in until 4 am, so I had to stay and bake everything at my job and left at 9 am, when I would usually have to leave at 5 am. you would expect me to be tired and pissed off, but I'm actually happy when I'm leaving work because I have plans to hang out with this girl later.

So I go home and fall asleep, and I wake up to her giving me a snap saying she's sorry that something came up and she's out with her friends right now. She said she can hang later, and I told her oh yeah that's fine let's hang out when you get home. So she gets home around 6 or 7, and she sends me another snap saying that she's busy once again, that's something came up at her house. This honestly ruined my day.

I looked forward to hanging out with this girl for such a long time, just for her to seemingly blow me off. I took a nap and woke up around 11:30 p.m. and realize that she didn't text me to hang out at night. What transpired happens in my previous r/rant post. In the comments of that post you'll find what I sent to her, somebody told me to send her how I truly feel, so I did. I told her that I understand her situation, that I know things come up but we had a plan to hang out and I told her that it ruined my day that we couldn't hang out, because it's not like we can hang out everyday.

She was asleep so I didn't get a text till a couple hours ago. And she was having none of it, she didn't necessarily tell me I was a horrible person, but her whole demeanor changed. I could tell she didn't want to talk to me anymore, she vilified me for no reason. she basically told me that she didn't want to talk to me anymore.

I told her how I felt one more time, how I wish she would just fucking tell me what's going on instead of being so vague, and then I removed her as a friend on Snapchat. I feel like I didn't do anything wrong, however my mind is conflicted, I screen recorded all of our snap conversations, and I will post them for further clarification if need be. I just don't know how.

Am I the asshole?

input: a few things first: he was *awful* to me. i was in a bad spot, and was binge-eating sugar due to stress at the time. he'd forcefully take any sugar i had while ridiculing and making fun of me for it, which would stress me out more. id basically inhale it when i got it back. he'd also take my phone whenever he wanted, threaten to lock me out unless i gave him the password, download incest porn on it, read ALL my (very personal) notes, then read them to me in a mocking voice while holding it away from me, *constantly* teased me..

&amp;#x200B;

i found out i was pregnant after he dumped me. i told him, saying i only wanted him to know, wanted nothing from him, and was only telling him in case she wanted to meet him, so i wouldnt show up at his door with a 5 year old. so far he's: talked about how hard it is on *him,* how *his* friends made fun of him when *he* told them (in response to me talking about how im doing all the work. carrying her, buying everything, going to end up being the main caretaker.. as if those were equal), asked me 30 times about *my* plan as if i was incompetent, without offering up *anything* ***he*** was going to do, threatened to sue me when i explained again i didnt want him around (making me sob and stressing me out in the first trimester, the most common time for miscarriages) only stopped after my parents called him and chewed him out, got arrested, told me he only wanted in her life because he was obligated, asked about details on me and my new (wonderful) partner, stressed me out more, etc..

&amp;#x200B;

he stopped for a bit, (bc prison) but now hes messaging me again. and, again, i explained why i dont want him around. she'll already *have* two wonderful parents, we're not friends/im not comfortable around you, its for *her* health and safety, everyone elses problems always have to be about *you,* the porn, the drinking/smoking/drugs (hes said he'd fix those three, but im not sure), you stress me out, strained relationships between parents can *really* mess with a kid, you threatened to sue me, you dont even *want* her and have done nothing but act like shes ruined your life, (to which he said he sees her as his ""last chance for redemption"" and ""the thing thatll fix him"" .. who puts *that* much pressure on an *unborn infant??* what happens when she DOESNT magically fix him? which, she *wont*) and theres not a *single* reason why you *should* be around. all he could come up with is ""shes ***my*** daughter!"" (which, i dont feel dragging a girl off into the woods to get off on her for 5 minutes entitles you to fatherhood.. dna isnt everything, doesnt make you the father of my child, and youve done *nothing* to be one) and ""are you just being overprotective because its ""close to your time"""", ignoring what i said *completely!*

Now complete the following example-
input: So, I know most of the stories on here are way more serious than this but here’s something to lighten it up I guess. 
So me and my friends have all been enjoying Super Smash Bros Ultimate (like any sane human). However, I’ve found myself becoming resentful towards my friend group. I wouldn’t consider myself an amazing player or anything, but I am definitely better than my friends who play. In a 1v1 scenario, I can usually win with most characters.  This doesn’t mean that they never beat me or anything, but I am just slightly above their skill level. The problem is that when I play with them, they always seem to team up on me. They will occasionally fight each other, but usually the battle goes like this.
1) They shoot projectiles at each other for 30 seconds and get one or two hits.
2) I hop in to try to actually fight them and not just fire off a projectile every five seconds.
3) They both spring into action and hit me up close as much as they can until I rack up damage and die. 
This is basically a rinse and repeat for every battle, every character. I don’t find it fun at all to sit on opposite sides of the stage and shoot at each other hoping you get a hit in for 10 minutes. I feel like they aren’t even playing the game, at least not the way it’s meant to. For this reason, I play with my friends less and less, and it doesn’t seem like they care anyways. This both makes me resentful and it hurts me because I don’t have many friends and I feel rejected by my group. So, AITA for feeing this way?

Now complete the following example-
input:  This was last year, I was 14 at the time and this was the first relationship either of us had.

Background: me and my ex (let's call her ""M"") were in the same class in 8th grade, she was very shy and socially awkward and I was pretty much her only male friend, There were pretty big hints that M had a crush on me, and I also had a crush on her, but eventually forced myself to get over her because I was afraid that if we would end up dating I'd stop liking her (hint: that's EXACTLY what happened).

Half a year went by and M asks me out via a mutual friend, I rejected her because of the reasons I mentioned her and we barely talked for the rest of the year. Fast forward a few months to the start of 9th grade, me and M talk about the rejection and decide we should go back to how it was, it all goes well for a week, cue the AITA.

I eventually develop feelings for M, and after about a day of thinking about it, I ask her out. It all goes well at first, but after 3 weeks or so I start to doubt if I liked her as much and she liked me, I think about it but don't do anything about it yet, a week later and it's our 1 month anniversary, I,  being the unoriginal guy that I am, ask my best friend for an idea for a gift, she tells me to draw a heart but instead of lines, it's all the reasons I love M, I think about it and wake up super early the day before to make the gift, I give it to her and she absolutely loved it, and it all goes well, for about a couple of hours. 

Me and my best friend were talking and the conversation drifted to me and M, and after a couple of minutes I realized that I was correct in doubting my feelings, and so I decide to break up with her the next day, not wanting her to be in a relationship with a guy who doesn't return the same feelings. 

Now, normally, this would be a normal thing to do, if it weren't for the fact that I gave her a gift to show my love for her, the day before breaking up with her because I don't have any feelings for her anymore, which lead to all of her friends hating me.

As for me, I think I was totally the asshole in this situation, but what about you, strangers of reddit,  do you think I was an asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: Hello Reddit, we meet again through a throwaway. Not sure how to organise this, so please tell if you find something unnecessary/confusing and I'll edit it. I'll try my best to answer questions and be unbiased.

I'm 15F. And my friend, let's call her Laura, is 17F. Laura's always been really critical and sometimes very harsh with her words, sometimes towards me. I've dismissed it as just her personality, but there was one conversation that bothered me. 

In a group chat, the topic was ""people who don't talk unless they have something valuable to say"", and I started to say a lot from my perspective. I basically said that it's okay to say anything as long as you're doing no harm. 

Laura and another friend, let's call him Noah, started to make fun of me. I usually don't mind when people insult me as a joke. Laura, however, sounded pretty serious and I felt like she was just bashing me for no reason. She said things like ""she thinks she has something valuable to say"", and after I was done, she said ""you just gave us a lecture about something we never said was wrong, and I bet it was just because you wanted to talk"". I later messaged her about it, to see why exactly she did it. She said she was just making the point that I just don't stop talking. I still didn't really understand *why*, but I brushed it off as me nitpicking.

She also likes to write, so she wrote some descriptions of group members that were supposed to be nice. Mine was about 8 lines long, but there are some parts I thought were rude:

""she hasn't read half the books or seen anywhere near the required repertoire of films for the proper level of respect.""

""she's one of those psychopaths who actually likes maths.""

""all you need to know about her is that she's easy to make fun of.""

I wasn't sure if I was being oversensitive, so I messaged another member of the group chat about it. Let's call her Sarah. Sarah called it ""brutal"" compared to everyone else's descriptions. Sarah said that Laura basically called me a psychopath and undeserving of respect. So I decided to confront her about it. I also asked her if she feels pressured to agree with Noah or act like him (since he does make fun of me), because I know that she has feelings for him. Her response was basically denying that, and that she gets anxious and projects on others. We went off-topic and it basically turned into me trying to suggest solutions for her problems. It was still filled with those kinda snarky or rude comments I've been mentioning. It hasn't been brought up again since.

I really can't tell who's wrong here, I'm trying to see if I was hypocritical and made fun of her before or something but can't remember anything, or if she was even disrespectful at all. Regardless of whether I end up being the asshole or not, I'm not sure what the next step is.

input: I’m 26 my wife is 23. I work about 50-55 hour weeks doing 2 jobs at a factory, desk and stocking soda machines, so she can stay at home and take care of our 11 MO son. I come home and decompress for about 30/45 min before relieving her if mama duties for the night. I feed him, play with him, change him, and put him to sleep every night and all weekend long unless my mom babysits. During this 2 hour or 2 day window  I want her to either clean or cook or do something. I don’t do regular cleaning around the home, but neither does she. I do laundry, dishes, trash. And all the difficult things with our son like clip his nails or clean his nose out (cuz he’ll scream bloody murder). I just want her to clean up more often too. She’ll only clean if someone she cares about is coming over.  What she does usually the entire time I’m home is watch videos on her phone or streamed on the tv. After the boy is asleep around 9pm I don’t want to do anything to else but rest but the home is a mess and it makes me restless. Tonight I went on a cleaning binge out being sick of it. AITA?

input: I have been friends with this girl since 6th grade (im currently a junior in college). We dont see eachother a lot because i go to college an 18 hour drive away. 
She says she doesnt want a job she doesnt like so refuses to get any job. But then she complains that she has no money. Shes blames her parents for not teaching her how to drive so she cant get her lisence. She wants to somehow get money for the government for her epilspy that she had 6 years ago. All she does all day is go on tinder to find a guy that will date her and buy her stuff basically so she can get things without working for it like she does now with her parents. She doesnt even leave the house ever she just watches tv and complains about her life and blames everyone else for the reason why she cant get her shit together. Sometimes shes get jelous of me and says how easy my life is (when its not) and sometimes ignores me because she ""cant relate to me when I do ""cool"" stuff"". In one case the ""cool stuff"" was going to canada for spring break.
I would consider myself as pretty ambitous and I dont like to complain a lot so that fact that all she does is complain and not take responsbility for her life annoys me. She was my best friend for so many years and the sweetest person ever. 

TLDR: childhood best friend annoys me by constantly complaining about her life but refuses to do anything to change it.

input: Hi, I’ll keep this short and sweet. I have a friend, not a very good one, who tends to be an asshole with people including me and the rest of our friend group. He’s just an overall very unfriendly and abrasive guy.

His girlfriend of two years broke up with him about a month ago, and he did not SEEM affected by it, of course he could’ve hid it well. So he has been talking to this other girl for maybe two weeks, and whenever I talk with him, if she comes up he will always talk about how he’s gonna “fuck her brains out” and things of that nature.

So I told her and she was disgusted by how he talked about her to us, let alone talking about this stuff before they did anything and before it’s gotten serious. She confronted this to him, and told him that I had told her, about the stuff he says and so she broke up with him.

Am I the asshole for warning her about this? Because now he won’t talk to me, and some of my closer friends in this group have made it very clear that I’m not welcome.

So my gf and I were together for 7 months but argument started to occur due to lack of communication. After about a week about more arguing/consolidating we decided that being friends with benefits (fuck buddies). This obviously didn't work as we caught feelings for each other and were currently in a limbo between relationship and FwB 

So yesterday for Valentine's we went to see a movie (Marie Queen of Scots) and went for a coffee b4 I kissed her goodbye and left for my train which was delayed *Ffs greater anglia*.
Before I left I asked what are we and she quoted me by saying, go with the flow. I assumed were together but I'll update on how it goes.

No we want to fuck tomorrow but she's starting her period. Now while I was her bf I would have been 100% ok with it. Like I don't like it but I would put up with it for her. Now we're in our current state I REALLY don't like blood on my dick (oh we usually go bare back). I never really gave a response b4 she went to bed but would IBTA if I cancelled tomorrow?

Now complete the following example-
input: A little bit of backstory: We're both 17, I'm a male and she's a female. I'm fairly considerate, as in I often give my friends stuff (for example cakes my mother makes), and so does she. A couple of times i asked her if she wanted me to bring her cake or whatever to school, and she always declined. One time i talked to her about it, and it concluded with her saying ""i don't want anything from you"" (as in material stuff i hope, anyways it's an awful thing to say). So, i kind of got mad because she never accepted my stuff but i always accepted her's. Also i confessed her love a month ago, which didn't end well because she was flirting with the other guy at the moment, but everything was pretty normal in our relationship since then, not even uncomfortable.

Today we had a fight about it. She brought me a chocolate bar i like, i declined, she kind of begged me to take it (begged is obviously too hard of a word). I didn't accept it in the end, and because she didn't want it back i just left it laying on a table (she saw that). After that she was mad about me not accepting her ""attention"", and saying, and i quote, ""i'll stop with acts of kindness/attention, so you won't have anything to decline, it will be easier on you, do what you want. I don't want to lose any more nerves on you, just know, ever again"". I shrugged at that statement, saying that i have no problem with her decision and that i didn't want to hurt her or anything. Also that i too feel bad about her not recieving my ""attention"". She was just really mad that she had to beg me to take her ""kindness"", because she thinks i humiliated her. I was pretty calm entire time, i told her that i really appriciate her kindness apart from not taking my favorite candy. She didn't really accept that, and is angry.

I hope i didn't give out too one-sided perspective, and i feel bad and dumb about this situation. Didn't really want a fight, and i literally had 0 problems with her, ever. But i really don't want to say sorry. How right am i?

**TL;DR** i got mad at my best friend for saying ""i don't want anything from you"", so i declined her next casual gift. She thinks i humiliated her because i so stubbornly declined, and is now angry at me.

input: So I've been best of friends with a girl I met a few years ago, before I started dating my now fiance, we'll call her Marta.  She's been stanning our relationship since day one. Has basically been saying she's going to be my bridesmaid if we ever get married. 

Over the years she's become one of my closest friends and I'd do anything for her and she seemed to feel the same way.  She's also kind of a flake due to some severe social anxiety, but mostly, has been there for me and has really cared for me.

December, my boyfriend proposed to me and she couldn't be more happy about it. Her dreams come true, she totally knows she's gonna be my bridesmaid. We set the date for May 16, 2020 and she's known for weeks.

I officially ask her to be my bridesmaid last week, card and gift and all.. she's thrilled! Next day I get the text that she didn't put 2 and 2 together.. she's booked for May 16, 2020. Her friend from growing up owns a dance studio and she does the photography/lighting for this three day dance recital. No one else can do this job.  She's not getting paid for this, it's totally volunteer, and it's 15 months from now. She's not even trying to find a replacement. She's flaked. 

I feel like she's choosing a volunteer position over my wedding.  She has said that dance is a big part of her life and it's really important to her.  She says I should be more understanding.  I can't see myself staying friends with her after this. AITA for cutting her out?

tl;dr my best friend has a volunteer commitment 1.5 years in advance and is choosing that over being a bridesmaid in my wedding.

She right away said that it's a joke, but I knew it wasn't, because this isn't the first time and she was dead serious last time and I told her this. She immediatly fired back with why am I so salty and things like that, and my response was that she's always hurt that everybody leaves from her company, but she fails to realise that what she does is wrong, and I gave her the example of why one of our mutual friends doesn't talk to her anymore, which was that she straight up called herself Allah. And when the guy who worshipped Allah blocked her, she messaged me saying how that guy is a cry baby, and she is right. She outright denied that she ever said these, even after I showed proof. And after that she started attacking me saying how I'm a loser, and how I will always be lonely, and I'm pathetic, and she brought up the problems I currently have with my family, and said nobody can be sadder than this man. So as a last thing I told her ""I will always be happier than you because atleast I see my faults"". And I left the group. After this I asked my friend if she said anything about the incident, and the only thing she said is that these are the early signs of autism. And around 2 hours ago I saw her instagram story, saying that everybody she cares about is abandoning her, even though she didn't do anything, and she's always to get hurt.

I'm really on the fence here.  Obviously I didn't write down more personal things, but this was the core of the argument

input: My best friend's girlfriend (27F) has a medical condition (Lupus) which affects her quite a lot. She gets tired really easily, has joint pains and gets fevers and headaches a lot. She has a decently paying job in an office, although can only work part time, and lives with her parents who are quite well-off so she doesn't pay rent or utilities or anything. She only recently became part of my friend group when she started dating my best friend, she is great and everyone really likes her. Whenever we do anything with her she isn't expected to pay, either her boyfriend pays or the rest of us just split the cost. I don't really agree with it since she has a job and lives rent/utilities free, but I go along with it since it's usually just like splitting her meal between 4 or 5 of us or something. We are planning a trip around Europe for 5 of us, including this girl. Her boyfriend wants us to split the cost for her to come, including flights, accomodation, food, etc. I don't see why we have to pay for her. She must have plenty money to spend since she lives with her parents and I don't think she really needs us to pay. I haven't spoken to anyone about this and am worried I am being an asshole because of her condition.

input: (I posted this on r/acting and decided it would probably work well here too. I added to the story so it was more interesting) Hello! Let's just have some background on this story. 

  I've gotten a role for my first play ever. It's at my school, so it's not the most professional. I'm not super picky with roles. There was one role I really wanted. We'll call this role S. S was a main role. She was smart and funny. One of my friends (A) wanted to smaller roles, F and T. It turns out that I got F and T, and she got S. She was mad, and originally I was to. We talked about asking to switch roles. The day we agreed to, she went home early, so I was alone. I don't like confrontation, so I got really nervous. One of my friends helped me out, and I asked the director. He said he would think about it. I played as S, F, and T throughout the entire rehearsal. I became much more comfortable with the roles, and embraced them.  I don't know how A feels still. I'm worried that she'll bother the director enough to get our roles switched. She is a better actor than I am, and I think she'll do better as this role. She also looks the part much better than I do. She can get kind of angry sometimes. I worry she'll still want F and T. I like my roles, and don't want to switch. I'm willing to fight for this. AITA for changing my mind, and not caring what my friend thinks?

Now complete the following example-
input: This isn’t one of those validation posts, though the title may seem that way. I’m being accused by my now ex of being the asshole.

Yesterday was my birthday, so my boyfriend picked me up to go out to eat when he got off work. We noticed two dogs on the side of the road, wearing collars/tags, and I insisted we stop and try to save them, though he did not want to. I got out of the car and was walking toward them, when two men on bicycles came from the other direction, so the dogs ran across the road, and one was hit by a car. We managed to get the dog out of the road, and I asked my boyfriend if we could take the dog to the emergency vet. He agreed, unfortunately the dog died on the way. 

He subsequently was upset because he was worried about the interior of his car, which I did offer to have professionally cleaned. As I sat there crying, clearly very upset, and said that had I not stopped, the dogs wouldn’t have crossed the road and died, he just said, “probably.” No words of comfort. Though I do believe it was my fault, I was still traumatized. Had he been upset and crying, even if I disagreed about why, I’d try to comfort him. He took me to a bar after, though I just wanted to go home, and freaked out when he finished his drink and I asked him to take me home. I got out of his car and shut the door harder than I intended (100% my fault) and said I’d talk to him the next day. He peeled out, and I was worried he’d get hurt driving like a maniac. I asked him to let me know when he got home, and one hour later with no message, I kept calling and then got sent to voicemail.  At least then I knew he was alive and not in a ditch somewhere. Either way, I sent a text breaking up with him, because he had been a complete jerk and then didn’t let me know he was home safe (I’d also like to point out, I’m not asking if I’m the asshole about the breakup. I shouldn’t have done it the way I did, that definitely makes me an asshole. But it’s also been coming for a few months. Every single person in my life told me they didn’t feel he was right for me, and this was just the last straw for me. We definitely had other issues, both his fault and mine. We just aren’t right for one another.) 

At the end of this, I think he’s an asshole because he cared more about his cars interior than the life of the dog, and treated me like I was the asshole for not caring about his car. Also for not letting me know and sending me to voicemail when I wanted to know he was home safe. And I will admit, I was upset and not looking at it from his perspective, which is why I had wanted to talk about it the next day, when we were both calmer. And he thinks I’m the asshole because he can’t really afford his car and wants to get rid of it as soon as he can, and the dog could have damaged his interior (which he did not I mention before we put the dog in the car, and the interior was not damaged, as the dog was not bleeding.)

So, Reddit, AITA, or is he?

Now complete the following example-
input: I (26M) recently got a bit upset after a conversation with my parents. It wasn’t much of a big deal, they just left me feeling slightly undervalued and a bit down.

When my girlfriend (25F) and I got home she could tell that I was upset and tried to comfort me. I realised that this feeling about my parents wasn’t particularly meaningful, and I would get over it after sleeping on it, but my girlfriend then got upset that she wasn’t able to successfully comfort me enough to stop me from being grumpy.

We end up getting into a minor argument because she had exhausted her efforts to try and cheer me up but I remain to be in a generally melancholic mood. My argument is that I feel I just need time to get over it and be cheery again, I can’t simply snap out of feeling a bit down. I suppose she might feel either like she is failing in what she might see as her role as my girlfriend to cheer me up, or perhaps she feels unappreciated herself by me and got frustrated. But I don’t think I can just decide to start being cheerful and forget about being upset with my parents. And I don’t want to just effectively lie to her and pretend that yes I am now all better even when I don’t feel it myself.

I can understand why she’d be frustrated, but AITA for not being able to just cheer up?

Now complete the following example-
input: My girlfriend and I have been together almost 10 years and have a 3 year old together. She works part time at the moment so money is a little tight. We're basically living paycheck to paycheck.

This month my gf got paid a little less than usual and won't be able to pay her half of rent and daycare. Which normally wouldn't be a big deal because earlier when she's been a little low on cash, she at least chips in a little bit towards those two things. I pay literally every other expense that we have. Streaming services, electric bill, gas, car insurance, everything. Which again is fine as long as she chips in on the two biggest expenses.

But this month she tells me she can't pay anything because she's going away for the weekend with some people from her choir. And that the hotel is going to cost pretty much half her salary. I get mad because I think her priorities are stupid and that she should have saved up for this trip months ago. She gets mad at me for being mad at her and just tells me it's her money and she can do what she wants with it.

AITA for thinking she should use her money to support our child and pay rent, instead of going on this expensive weekend?

Now complete the following example-
input: Earlier today I was out on a cold walk with my wife in the countryside. The lake had frozen over, and I was absentmindedly throwing stones into it to make that weird sound that lakes make when you throw stones on them when frozen. A guy pulls up in his van, rolls down his window, and the following conversation happens:

&amp;#x200B;

Him: \[...\] throwing stones in the lake?

Me: Uhh what?

Him: What the fuck do you think you're doing? They're expensive fish in there.

Me: I'm sorry... I didn't think it would be...

Him: You didn't think?? You're a grown man! Look at that fucking mess!

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I didn't get to respond, as he drove on to turn his van around -- I'm glad I didn't, because what had occurred to me was ""They're just stones on an ice lake, it's not like I'm vandalising"". I think if I had said it, it would have only escalated the situation.

A woman, who was walking with her family close by, asked me what he said ""He seems to have a problem with me throwing stones in the lake!"" I responded. At this point, I noticed that he was turning back and I didn't want to give him any more of a reason to be pissed off at me, so I pulled myself and my wife out of the way in anticipation of where he was going to be driving. We were now out of the direction of where his van could go and he stopped his van again and for the second time said something I could only catch the end of:

&amp;#x200B;

Him: \[...\] run you over!

Woman: What? You'll run me over?

Him: No, I said \_he\_ should get out the way because I \_don't\_ want to run him over. Don't get fucking mouthy with me!

Woman's husband: What did he just say to you?

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, the woman's husband appeared to be following the van and wanted some kind of conflict. My wife and I just left that area and walked off somewhere else; I didn't want to anything to do with that. It's not in my nature to want conflict over anything, not least of all over stones on a lake.

So here's the thing, the guy was confrontational and seemed to really want a fight with just about anyone. That said, him being confrontational by nature doesn't automatically make him an asshole, and certainly doesn't prevent me from being an asshole. I looked it up and found that apparently breaking ice with stones on a lake can indeed harm fish, so whether or not the guy handled it in the right way, he was right to call me out in doing something wrong. Not that I knew it would harm fish at the time. But the impression I had was that I was vandalising the lake with stones -- now admittedly they were large stones... like rocks... bigger than an apple I guess, but it has never occurred to me before that stones on a lake could be considered any kind of vandalism.

I feel like the fish being ""expensive"", and the ""mess"" I made aren't really an issue. If I knew I was harming fish I wouldn't have done it. So I guess in addition to AITA, I guess my question is: Is it vandalism to throw stones, or even large rocks onto an ice lake?

Spent the day with a very dear friend who always uses the wrong words and also mispronounces words. I don't correct her, because I've always figured it's rude. I won't deny that it annoys the hell out of me. Anyway, we went all over town browsing furniture stores, shopping for nothing in particular, when I observed that I liked the look of a certain dining room suite. She said, ""It's a *suit.*"" Okay. I know she always says ""suit."" That isn't going to make *me* say it that way. I looked at her and rolled my eyes. 

""Well,"" she said ""I'm just trying to help. I know you don't want to run around sounding like an idiot.""

""Thanks, but you are the one who sounds like an idiot. Google it or something."" She got on her phone and I guess must have looked it up, but commented, ""It might be spelled with and ""e,"" but it's silent."" I probably rolled my eyes again, but didn't say anything.

Later, she said, ""Hey look at the price of that CHESTER DRAWER!""  

""I believe you meant to say, 'chest of drawers?"" She didn't respond.

We were driving home. I passed up an opportunity to correct ""pacifically,"" ""rod iron,"" and ""touch basis"" but I did correct her when she said she hated driving under ""viadocks"" in the rain.

That prompted her to stop talking. She just sat there staring ahead until we got to her her house. She got out of the car, slammed the door, and hasn't responded to any texts.

My one friend whose been asking stupid questions all night told me to get out of his fucking room for that question when i was just fucking asking.

Now complete the following example-
input: Let me preface this a little. 

I graduated college a semester early and moved back home while job shadowing and waiting to get into grad schools. Since I have no money, my parents are actually paying for what I used at college (ie- rent, utilities). I have lived with my roommates for a couple years. Every summer, we agreed that the roommate who lives there pays the utilities that are fluid, meaning they change with amount of usage. These utilities are- gas, water, electric. 

So, since I have moved home, my roommates are still wanting me to pay 1/3 of the gas, water, and electric. I said no because my parents are already letting me live here rent free and paying for what I use here. I also do not contribute to the usage of said utilities, so the **prices went down**. They said that they were not ""comfortable"" paying 50/50 because it was not fully discussed, even though we have done this the past two summers. AITA here???? I have not used any water, gas, or electric, so I am actually confused as to why I should be paying? I told them I would pay the bills that didn't fluctuate, because I thought that was fair since we all signed off on Wifi/cable. I am trying to discuss this with them, but they just don't respond, except for saying they are not comfortable paying it. 

Also, just to add, one roommate has a bf that essentially lives there without actually being on the lease. He does not go to school, and sits in the house most dat. He uses MUCH more water, gas, and electric than me, so why is he getting it for free?

If anyone can contribute feedback or solution I would really appreciate it! 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR i am not using utilities so why should I have to contribute?

Now complete the following example-
input: Context: I live in some townhomes that are independently owned, but many are owned and rented out. We rent and the people next door rent as well (from different landlords). The HOA rules state that no dogs are allowed. We got an exception because I have a ten pound, very well-behaved dog. He barks when someone knocks on the door but other than that I doubt anyone in our neighborhood knows he exists. It’s important though that we actually have permission to have a dog. We didn’t sneak him past anyone. Most of the neighbors do have dogs. It isn’t a well kept secret, but it doesn’t bother us. 

The neighbors directly next door, though, are starting to be a problem. They have two big breed dogs in a ting apartment. They only let them out on to a tiny patio. It’s the kind of dog we want- but refuse to get yet because they deserve (and need)  a massive yard. When the owners aren’t home the dogs whine / groan all day. It’s a sad sound that makes my dog pace. For hours a day. When they come home they put the dogs upstairs and begin band practice. 

Band practice is another issue. For a townhome with thin walls I don’t know why they’ve decided to practice here every night. It’s gotten louder as time goes on. At first, we were just like “well they pay to live here too”. But then it started going later and later and getting louder and louder. To the point where we can’t watch tv because we can’t hear it. We’ve asked them to turn it down twice and they’ve been very nice and complied. But I don’t think we should *have* to ask. 

During band practice the dogs are even more worked up, too. They know people are home so they bark to hang out. And then get yelled at to shut up. The yelling makes it even worse. 

I can’t really drown it out. White noise isn’t enough unless I’m wearing headphones. I shouldn’t have to wear those 24/7 in my own home though. 

WIBTA if I turned them in for having dogs, even though I have one? I know it’d result in them violating the lease and being made to move immediately (or sadly giving the dogs up, which I don’t want- but they are not being cared for) while complaining about the music would be a slower process.

Now complete the following example-
input: I was at the local gym and was really pumped to try a new workout routine I read about. It was about 5:45pm on a Tuesday, so the place was packed with after-work crowds getting in a workout before dinner. I was working on a quick circuit with a treadmill, some free weights, and a bench. I notice a pretty jacked dude getting setup for his bench presses, which is right next to my bench. Though he looked jacked, he definitely couldn't easily lift the weights he had and was really struggling, and making loud annoying breathing sounds. I HATE THAT, it immediately makes me want to make eye contact and scream.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. dude loudly finishes his bench press set, after which he begins getting free weights for some squats, again right next to my area. Again, he picks up at least twenty pounds too much and begins to squat and almost fall over into me. I felt I had to constantly move my gear further away because of him. During his last set, I was finishing up some curls and heard that annoying loud breathing sound. I had enough, so I dropped my weights and walked up to him and looked him dead in his sweaty eyes and yelled ""SHUT UP AND SQUAT! He was so taken aback, he didn't know what to do...so he dropped his weights and proceeded to walk over to the security desk to report my lashing out.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm banned from the gym, even though I was working out quietly like any normal human being. WTF?!

Now complete the following example-
input: So my boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years. He’s a very talented musician. He was in a band when we met. About a year into our relationship he joined a different band that’s much more involved. They’re moderately successful. They usually tour April-September ish. honestly, it depends on the festival season and a ton of other stuff. Also, I live in Virginia because of him. I moved here about 5 and a half years ago to help my brother and his wife out with their baby. They’re military and got transferred elsewhere about 2 years ago. My boyfriend and his family are the only family I have on this coast. ALSO I’m a flight attendant based in Boston so I travel a lot and don’t have a traditional work environment to make friends. I don’t really have any friends in Virginia. My boyfriend and his family are literally all I have here.

Since college I’ve always been a bit weird about my birthday. My birthday was always over spring break so I never really got to celebrate it. I can honestly recount every single birthday I’ve had since I met my boyfriend. A few of them have been disappointing and we’ve had issues with it before. He knows it’s important to me and the last few years he’s really tried to make it special.

A couple weeks ago his band’s manager posted on their instagram that they were going to be playing at Savannah Stopover which is March 7th-8th. This was the first I’d heard of it and my birthday is the 5th. It’s at least a day’s drive down there so I asked him if he was going to be gone for my birthday. I just wanted to be prepared if he was. He said no he should be home, and that was the start of a couple weeks on the road so they probably wouldn’t be leaving until the 7th or the 6th at the very earliest. I asked him if he was sure and he said he was pretty sure. 

This morning I brought it up again. He said he couldn’t imagine them leaving before the 6th and that he was pretty sure that was the start of the tour. I asked him point blank: “are you *really* not sure or do you know you’re going to be gone for my birthday and you just want to say?” He said “babe, I’m telling you what I know.” 

I took that to heart and started planning my birthday this afternoon. I texted my best friend who lives in Boston (and is also a flight attendant) and asked her if she wanted to come visit for for my bday. She of course said yes. I said to her “all I want for my birthday is to go to brunch and then day-drink and watch movies at home with you, boyfriend, and the kitties.”

The band has been recording some new songs about 30 min away from here. He left not long after our conversation. When he got home this evening this is the conversation we had:


me: I invited *bff* to come down for my birthday, I hope that’s okay.

bf: oooh about that. We have a show.

me: excuse me? what? we just talked about this less than 12 hours ago.

bf: yeah *band manager* reminded me today. we talked about it over email a few months ago and I totally forgot I said it was fine.

me: what? you just said today you didn’t have any shows before savannah stopover. how did you not only forget this conversation but also forget that’s my birthday!?

bf: sorry if was over email a few weeks ago and I just didn’t notice. 

me: seriously what the fuck I’ve asked you about this multiple times over the last few weeks.

bf: it wasn’t on purpose I didn’t even realize it was your birthday but even if I had I would have still said yes because it’s $1700 and we could use the money.

I was speechless at that. He tried to hug me and I told him to go to bed and he went upstairs. I’m downstairs drinking wine and stewing. My feelings are really hurt. He’s come down once since and didn’t say too much but suggested I could come to the show on my birthday and tried to hug me. I pushed him off and told him to go to bed.

Three years ago I went to New York for a show on my birthday and he didn’t tell anyone it was my birthday. It may as well have just been a regular day. I’m not trying to do that again. Not to mention the fact that we have cats now so if he’s gone and I go too then we have to get someone to take care of them. 


I don’t know where to go from here. I’m really upset and my feelings are really hurt. I realize this is definitely a first world problem but he knows how I feel about my birthday and could have done so many things differently to not make me feel so shitty. I really don’t think I’m the asshole here but I want to make sure before I make a big thing of it. If I’m the asshole here I’ll try to accept it and stop being upset at him. I know not everyone cares about their birthdays the way I do. 

Very interested in outside opinions.

input: To give a little backstory, my girlfriend (who I’ll call Ann) and I have been dating for almost a year now and we’ve been going pretty smoothly. I introduced her to my friend (who will be called Bob) who introduced her to his boyfriend (who will be called Jim,), everyone got along well. One day I get a text from Bob  saying that Ann and Jim are over at his and asking if I want to come up as well. I reject the offer as I was pretty ill that day, he sent me a few images of them having fun together, she texted me a few times. I had gotten a text later from Bob showing a picture of her T-shirt pulled downed a bit showing her bra, I texted her asking if she was alright and she replied that Jim and Bob were poking her breasts and ass and that she felt a little uncomfortable (in case anyone asks, they were bisexual).

Fast forward a few months, Jim and Bob have broken up and we all, more or less, cut off contact with Bob and Jim and Ann are best of friends. Now Jim personality is very flirty and that can make me a bit jealous at times, though Ann never flirts back. I was texting her one day and I ask her “What’s up?” And she replies “I’m on the way to [insert my hometowns name]” I ask her what’s she’s gonna do here as she hadn’t texted me beforehand to ask if I wanted to hang out, she said that Jim and her were gonna hang out and asked if I wanted to come along, I responded with a simple “Yes.” They both come of the bus and I greet her with a hug and say hello to Jim (who had also came on the bus) and they two immediately got to talking, I just kind of floated around feeling a bit like a third wheel. We eventually got to the town centre and I told them that I was gonna run home quickly to get a coat as it was a bit chilly and for them to wait there. When I returned we continued walking around. Fast forward to the end of the night, I got into a small argument with Ann about drinking, she felt like I was a bit too restrictive with it (I don’t drink) and basically didn’t want her drinking because she doesn’t handle it well. I stormed off back home. I apologised next morning through text and admitted that I had been a massive asshole. 

Fast forward to about a week or two ago, I had, more or less, come to the conclusion that Jim didn’t like me very much, I talked to Ann about this and she kinda confirmed this. We basically talked about Jim for a while, and that I especially disliked him for showering her with compliments. She revealed to me that after I went to get my coat, they had talked about me (he had basically said that I seemed a bit insensitive), and after the argument over alcohol he had encouraged her to break up with me (she didn’t, luckily), and I have grown to have a big disliking of him. Am I an asshole for wanting her to stop being his friend?

tl;dr - My girlfriend best friend poked her ass, flirts with her, dislikes me and encouraged her to break up with me.

Now complete the following example-
input:   

One year ago, during the spring semester of my freshman year at college, I started dating my first girlfriend, and my roommate, being a good friend, would leave the room 3-5 times a week for several hours late at night so that we could spend time in there. However, I never explicitly told him to leave in a hostile way, and I always made it clear that he wouldn’t have to leave if he didn’t want to. She would also spend the night maybe 1-2 times a week, but I also would ask him if it was OK each time and made sure I had the green light. For about the first month or so, we did abuse the room usage. A couple times he stayed outside the room until past midnight. After this, he expressed annoyance at me, and eventually I realized I was being an asshole. Even though I never explicitly told him he couldn’t come back in, I was taking advantage of his kindness by asking for extreme hours of having the room to myself.

Over the summer, we talked about the situation and I apologized, and said that I would try to be a better roommate. The next semester (fall) we were once again sharing a room, and this time I tried to hang out at my girlfriend’s place more. My girlfriend and I usually study together almost every day.  Although there is a living room, I prefer studying in my room because I have a desk setup with a monitor, and there are usually people in the living room watching TV or talking. We were in my room 3 times or less a week and spent the other days at her place or on campus, and I never commanded him to leave the room, but I did ask about 4 times over the course of the semester when I knew he didn't have anything important to do. A couple of these times were late at night but did not alter his sleeping schedule since he sleeps very late. I tried to schedule sex around his schedule, but he rarely leaves the room, and only attended one of his classes, which my girlfriend was also taking. He was generally in the room 24/7 (except to make a quick food run), but he would leave the room 2x a week for a couple hours or less when we studied in there, even though I never asked him to. 

From his point of view, he said that he feels a societal pressure, and that we wanted him to leave the room when we were just there studying. I always tried to make it clear that he didn’t have to leave, ever, if he didn’t want to, and told him this many times.  Also, my girlfriend and I are very quiet, and spend most of the time in the room studying. She would sit on my bed and study and I would sit at my desk. We didn’t talk loudly or laugh loudly. However, my roommate was still extremely frustrated that he had to deal with me and my girlfriend. He always said that us being in the room made him leave and complained that we “locked him out” to me and our friends. He said he feels like a dog being let in and out of his room.

Fast forward to this semester, because of his increasing frustration, I tried to have my girlfriend in the room even less. Since the start of the semester, we haven’t been in the same room as him more than 30 minutes (such as right before or after we go to an event), and I only have sex with her when he leaves the apartment. There were 3 times he came back to the room while we were having sex and knocked on the door. At this point I really don’t want him to be annoyed so as soon as he knocks my girlfriend and I put on our clothes, no matter where we are, and rush out of the room to not bother him. This would take 2-5 minutes tops, but each time this happened I could tell he was really angry. I should have given him a warning that we were using the room, but I didn’t want to make him feel like he was locked out of the room, and I made sure to leave immediately each time he came back. The last time we did this, last weekend, was when some of our friends came over. My roommate and about five of our friends were playing smash (a video game), and my girlfriend and I were kind of just sitting there not playing. We went into the room and it eventually led to sex. Later, as our friends are leaving, he says that he is very annoyed at me. 

Yes, I admit having sex while our friends were over was a really cringy thing to do, and I wouldn’t do it again. However, my roommate is super angry at me. He called me selfish and ungrateful for what he has done for me and tells me that I’m an asshole. He also said that if I asked anyone else that they’d tell me I was an asshole. Honestly, I’m not sure what other people would think since I haven’t explained the whole situation that much to others. I know I was an asshole in the beginning of the relationship but since then I’ve tried to be with my girlfriend around him less and less, so I don’t really feel like an asshole at the moment. So reddit, AITA?

TL;DR

I got a girlfriend and we used to spend a lot of time in the room, but now we spend almost no time in the room when he’s there, and he still thinks I’m an asshole.

Now complete the following example-
input: I was seeing a girl for just over 3 months, we would see each other roughly 4-5 times a week so it was quite often I saw her. We did a lot of fun activities in this time that it was like we were dating, but not with the official ""relationship' tag yet. We had talked about this quite heavily and we were going to wait until sometime in the early new year (this year), we both wanted to wait until this year so it was all mutual. We both were quite regularly in each other's lives that we had met friends and parents etc.

&amp;#x200B;

But now on to the question, it was New Year's Eve (just been) and we had already agreed to a plan that I would hang out with my friends earlier on in the day for a few drinks and then we would catch up together when we went out for the night life. Once it got to New Year's Eve she tried to persuade me to spend the whole day with her without getting to see my friends at all &amp; I of course said no, because this was the plan for my friends and I before I started seeing her. 

&amp;#x200B;

She didn't like this answer and told me that she didn't wanted to speak to me (just for not wanting to spend the whole day with her when I was going to see her later on in the night anyway). I tried reasoning but to no avail. I put on a happy face and had a good New Years. I then wake up on New Years day to a text from her telling me that she was really sorry and that she kissed someone last night, and that she would do anything for my forgiveness. I was upset but I wasn't going to let a little kiss (presumably when she was drunk) ruin the amount of time we've spent together. So we sorted it out, but 2 days later I found out that she also had sex with this person from a mutual friend early morning. Since she wasn't staying at mine that night I sent her a text message about it and she told me everything, my very last response to her was ""I don't know what to say anymore"", I was in utter shock. I didn't contact her again.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I The Asshole for not telling her that I didn't want to continue what we had? It's been twenty-ish days since this happened and I still feel guilty I didn't properly tell her. Also keep in mind that she has tried contacting me a few times since then &amp; that we weren't technically in a relationship but I still was 100% invested in her.

input: So for context, I live in an area where although marijuana is illegal, it's not strictly enforced. The police normally just take the weed and be on their way. He's approaching 18 years of age.

He does it consistently every day, comes back late and high when my parents are asleep and I'm just going to bed. I wouldn't normally care, he's got a job and he can do whatever he wants, but a couple of things have changed.

One : He's getting quite a bit into debt with my parents, they've lent him money for a new car after he crashed his old one, he has a crap ton of insurance to pay, and has racked up about 10-12 parking tickets (that I know of), that he refuses to pay.

Two : He's driving constantly while high. I've heard it's not as bad as drink driving, but given that he drives badly anyway it's slightly worrying.

Would I be the asshole for snitching? I generally don't feel comfortable with the idea, but I think my parents have a right to know if they're helping finance him. I did tell him I wouldn't tell our parents when I first asked him about it, but have since regretted saying that.

Now complete the following example-
input: So I’ve got a really close friend who recently came out to me as MtF transgender. We’ve always gotten along really well, but since she’s started her transition Ive started to get the feeling that she’s been copying me - a lot. 

It started off with little things. She talked about really looking up to my style and asked to go thrifting with me. Of course I agreed. But over the past few months she’s started doing more and more of the same things as me- poetry, yoga, listening to the same music, watching the same shows. I wouldn’t mind if she was just taking inspiration from me or if she only did a few of these things, but I’m genuinely feeling like she is taking my entire personality. 

So far, I haven’t been able to bring myself to say anything to her. I know that transitioning is difficult and that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery— but I also don’t think it’s an excuse to copy every aspect of my style, interests, and personality. I don’t want to cut ties with her because she’s genuinely a really good person, but right now I’m honestly resenting her too much to think straight. Am I the asshole?

input: The bus I commute on has a stop right next to a facility for the mentally challenged, and more often than not, people get on the bus to go to the city.  
  
 When I see a mentally challenged person coming onto the bus, and the seat next to me is empty, I either put my bag on it, or try to sit as widely as possible. I'm 186 cm (6'1"") tall so when I do that, there isn't much room next to me. If someone asks that I move my bag, I obviously oblige.  
  
The reason for doing this is that often the mentally challenged person is loud, has bad personal hygiene or is just generally unpleasant to sit next to. Often they are also quite obese and take up a lot of space. They also may ignore when I need to exit the bus, as I often am the only one who exits at my stop.  
  
The reason I'm writing here is that someone sort of called me out on it today, as they loudly remarked to a mentally challenged person that ""they could sit next to them, and people shouldn't have their bags on the empty seats. ""

input: My birthday is coming up soon and we are currently in Las Vegas for spring break, home to some of the best steakhouses in the world.  Because I really enjoy steak, I picked out a first restaraunt to eat at.  However, when my mom found out I had picked a steak house with no alternative dishes, she got very angry, as she claims she cannot eat steak (she's not vegetarian, she just follows a strict diet).  I then changed the venue to a much nicer and more expensive steakhouse at the Wynn, but with vegetarian options for her.  I thought she would be happy, but she was extremrly mad again, this time complaining about the price.  Now, this steakhouse os definitely very pricey, with an 8oz filet costing $70.  However, we rarely go to these kind of restaraunts (last time we went to a resraraunt like this was last summer, and even then it was nearly 40% cheaper).  Money is not a problem in our family either.  Anyways though, I got sick of my mom rejecting restaraunts for my own birthday dinner so I basically told her that she can just stay home if she doesn't want to go.  currently, my dad and I have a reservation for two.  My mom has been yelling at me all afternoon for not accomodating her and being selfish.  AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input:  We sat down to watch a movie and I pulled out my knitting. About twenty minutes into the movie, my boyfriend paused it and asked me to stop. I asked him if it was too noisy, and said I could switch to a different kind of needle so it wouldn't click. He said no, but said it was rude to knit when we are supposed to be watching a moving together, and to please pay attention. I said that I am, but I just like to have something to do with my hands while I'm watching something. He said he would prefer I pay full attention and to please put down the knitting. I said no, I'd really prefer to be able to knit, that I'm not distracted, I am fully capable of doing both at once, and that I do it all the time.   


He got very annoyed and told me I was being rude and disrespectful, and if I didn't put it away, we would stop watching. I had a feeling this would ruin the whole weekend so I just put down my knitting, he said thank you, and we continued. Halfway into the movie, he picked up his phone and started doing something. I paused the movie and asked him why it was okay for him to do that but I couldn't knit? He got annoyed and slammed down his phone. We finished the movie and he stomped off to play video games. I turned on the tv show I've been going through (Awkward.) and continued knitting.   


The next day, he told me that he thinks it's rude to knit through a movie and through TV shows, and that it makes me come across like I have ADHD and am a toddler who can't sit still. I explained that I've always done things like this. When I was a kid, my parents would draw or color with us while we watched TV. When I learned to sew, I'd watch Arthur and sew. When I picked up knitting, I would watch TV, or read, or even take walks with my mom if it was portable. I always feel better if I'm making something instead of just sitting there. 

But I also listen to music and run. Or listen to audiobooks while I'm at work. I love multitasking. I love media and I love to be productive and I love being creative. Perfect, right?

He told me it was rude and that when we do something, to please put 100% of my focus into it instead of paying attention to my knitting. I told him that if that's really an expectation he has, I didn't think this relationship would have a long future, because I am not going to just sit there and watch TV and do nothing else.  I explained that I find it very boring and lazy to just sit there and watch TV, and while I get how other people find joy in just doing nothing, I don't. 

For the record, I asked if he felt like I was ignoring him, or not paying enough attention to him, etc, but he said that isn't the issue, just that I should be more respectful when I am watching TV or Movies because the creators work very hard and it's insulting that I won't pay full attention.

So am I the asshole here?

I play trombone in the band and I've rented a French horn to learn, which means every Monday and Wednesday I carry a trombone on my right shoulder with my hand to secure the strap (case has backpack straps and I use one since I have an actual backpack too) and the horn in my left. Now, I know this light. If you don't press the button button before the light turns green, even if it's a half second late, the hand doesn't turn into the green walking guy, but the light still will be green for over a minute. I get to the light right as it turns green, and obviously my hands are full so there's no realistic chance of me pressing the button. I look both ways and walk. Then, I hear a loud engine and someone laying into their horn. I turn to see this speeding black car racing towards me and slightly drifting towards the curb but not signaling. Given that I just walked past a bar, I take a couple steps back to position the light pole thing between myself and the car ( I only had taken a couple steps into the crosswalk) as a precaution. The driver slams his break in the middle of the crosswalk, makes an angry gesture towards the red hand, drives extra slowly until he's out of the crosswalk, and then zips away. Now this confused me because whenever I drive, I always look for pedestrians, light or no light. I get that the walk signal is somewhat for my safety but do drivers really rely so heavily on it?

TL;DR I walked technically on a red light even though the traffic light would stay green for a long time, angry driver honks at me

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm 23 and provided full time care for my 3 year old sister I am essentially her parent 90% percent of the time. I also have a 12 year old brother and a 10 year old sister whom I cook for as well.

  
My Step-father is the provider for the family, he works construction 6 days a week for about 10 Hrs . My mom goes to the methadone clinic at 8:40AM and comes back between 11AM - 5PM, usually around 3PM.

  
Now on to what happened earlier today.  
When I use a measuring cup I take it off the little ring that keeps them together so I don't need to wash them all out and this pisses her off to no end because it's ""not how she cooks in her kitchen"". However today I did not make anything and my dad was in the kitchen playing with my baby sister who took them out and left them on the table after they left. This blew her top and she started yelling at me saying I'm ""leaving messes for her to pick up"" (it was the only thing out in the kitchen) and then upon me groaning about her yelling it pissed her off more and she screamed about how I'm ""going through her room and messing with her shit"" (this stems from me and my dad having searched the room months ago and finding xanax). Now the previous day she came home dead tired to the extent of slurring her words and dropping her keys outside and leaving them there because she couldn't be bothered. Due to her being so tired she didn't remember leaving her make up bag in the car, her purse in the living room, or much of anything else. And when unable to find said things she yelled at me for moving her shit. Now I'm very tolerant when she is directing the shouts at me but we had also fought two nights before at 2 am and I asked her to be quite and I would too thus ending the argument, however she always need to get in a couple extra paragraphs.

Again today I asked her to do the same as I had just woke up, and as before she kept going on and on and on and on.  
I snapped and yelled for her to ""Shut The Fuck Up"" this escalated quickly to her calling me a piece of shit and how she never would have talked to her mom like that (guess what she has) and then continued on by saying I was ungrateful and what kind of son I was. I ended up losing it and essentially said she's a shit mom who always has to have things her way and couldn't even take care of her own kid for 3 years and how she dropped me on my grandma so she could have a few extra dollars to buy her dope when I was a kid. And that when on for a good 30 minutes until my dad got back and stopped it.

TL;DR I'm 23, dropped out of high school to care for mom after back surgery and stopped progress towards my GED due to fatigue as I've essentially been a full time parent for my baby sister (3) and 2 other siblings (12 &amp; 10) for the last 4 years. Got into a word war with my mom because of a measuring cup, it escalated, she called me a trash son and piece of shit and I called her a shit parent and a junkie.

input: My mom has been in Arbonne (MLM) for about 2-2 1/2 years now and I have never really been supportive of it. There have been a few times where we argue over it cause I think that she puts way too much time into it and is neglecting some of her responsibilities as a parent. I also think she is putting way too much unwarranted stress on herself and it bothers me when I hear her complain about it almost every other day like she has no control over it. She argues that long term this is going to be so good for our family. But I don't really buy it. Financially-wise, I don't believe that it has brought in any extra cash flow that made a difference. We are not exactly in a stable situation in regards to money. But she is so passionate about it and I feel like an asshole for not supporting her. It's not like she's doing anything illegal (although I would say that MLM schemes are immoral/unethical to say the least). And I'm of the belief that you should support any venture a friend/family member is wanting to try unless it is self-destructive or illegal. Also, she was in another MLM scheme when I was a child called Herb-a-life. And apparently that failed miserably and she was pretty distraught about it, but I was too young to know. My family and my aunt pretty much agree with me and my aunt has been more vocal about it and I know they had a big fight about it several months ago, but my family is not the type to be very open. I was raised in an environment where our feelings were never really expressed. She is so adamant about it and shows no signs of slowing down, and I just wonder if maybe I should stay quiet and be as supportive as I can and let it run its course.

Now complete the following example-
input: Story goes like this: We had been dating for about half a year (Give or take) and my gf at the time was doing theater in Bern. I'm not a big fan of it myself, but I did like her singing, so I would make time to go see her whenever she had practice or a show.

&amp;#x200B;

It was December, and I had caught a pretty bad cough combined with mild pneumonia. Stayed at home for a good while, and ended up missing a lot of the performances she does around Christmas. Eventually, as I got better, she started to approach the subject of coming to a specific play of hers they had been preparing for a while. I was against it initially, since my cough had adamantly refused to go away, and my throat still hurt. Eventually I caved to the puppy-eyes routine. And on the day in question, dressed up like a conservative Eskimo and had a friend drive me to the station. Weather outside was awful, and as luck would have it the train stopped halfway due to ""technical difficulties"". I was going to be late. I called my gf to inform her of this, and she was livid. I had missed performances before, a lot of the time due to work or other shenanigans, and she would often accuse me of making up excuses to avoid having to go.

&amp;#x200B;

I was very firmly in the ""I'm doing this for you even though I'm sick, so stop giving me shit.""-Camp. She's having none of it. Eventually it turns into an argument and she hangs up in a huff. When I actually got there (Think it was about halfway into the play) the guy at the front is not letting me in. Invitation had been revoked.

&amp;#x200B;

When the play finally ended, and I got a hold of her, we were now both mad. I was feeling much worse again and really wanted to go home and she was still upset that I had missed all of the play. Eventually, she makes a big thing of leaving with an actor friend of hers, and leaves me standing there. And I don't have money for a ticket back. Cue an hour of texting, ducking into stores to not stand outside, and eventually getting hold of a friend, who despite the apocalyptic weather, came and picked me up.

&amp;#x200B;

GF is not responding to texts. At that point, I actually got worried. Since the weather was so bad, maybe they had an accident? Nope. Around 90 minutes or so after the whole thing I get a pretty picture from a party they're having. Complete with guilt-trip inducing ""You could've been here you know."" / ""I Hope you rethink our relationship"". That was the tipping point. I did rethink our relationship. When I got home with buddy, we rounded up all of her stuff and I told her she could pick it up later or the day after, and then get of my life. I made a point of ignoring all of her attempts at getting in touch afterwards, which I'll freely admit, meant I was burning all of the bridges out of spite. But I still absolutely believe this is her being the Ass, and I was justified. Am I wrong?

How did I not head the warning? I literally said it wouldn't happen again.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Linked to a community-based in pseudoscience? How was I suppose to know the mods of sex would feel that way? Nowhere in the sex sub link policy does it start speficly banned links. 

According to the pornfree sub they are ""This community exists to help people of all ages overcome their addiction to porn.

[Here is a collection of those posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/au9wq/here_is_a_list_of_the_submissions_that_inspired/)"" that sounded supportive and positive to me.

The feedback I got from OP for one of my many comments trying to help, ""That's an illuminating way of putting it. You've given me a lot to think about. Thank you.""

I made no other comments or posts after I started this exchange with the automod and mod.

It was a promotional internet subscription for $50 a month.  Now that she’s added a cable subscription even if we decide to go back to just internet, we’ve lost that promotion and the lowest price will be $70 a month.  

She ordered the cable subscription without telling me adding an extra $80 to our bill.  She said that there was just nothing ever on Netflix or Hulu that she wanted to watch.  That she’s the one home most of the time so it’s not fair to not have some options that she would enjoy to watch.  I’m annoyed at the loss of the promotional internet price and the extra $80 a month without even discussing it with me first.  

I can’t stand regular cable anymore.  Haven’t had it in years and have no intention of watching any of it.  Since she took it upon herself to add an $80 package I feel like that’s a bill she should foot solely.

Now complete the following example-
input: I let him know that our 1 month old daughter, me, and my mum (visiting us in the city for a day) were gonna go out to the city today and buy new bras for me (haha boobs grew big during pregnancy)


At first I was texting him during our outing and sending pics and stuff but then I got busy and didnt text him for a few hours.

 
I dont know if the reason *why* I was busy is relevant but just in case: basically I was trying to fit a lottt of shopping activities into a veryy small timeslot all at the same time while feeding the baby, changing her diapers, and keeping her from ever crying so that she does not disturb other customers. And allll this time my mum was rushing me, telling me to *hurry up* telling me she wants to go outside with the baby and im trying to get her to chill the fk out and hand me my baby because we do NOT need to go outside of the store and the baby will be fine if I just hold her for a darn sec and give her a bottle... yadda yadda basically corralling an unruly grandma :) not a big deal for me but deefinitely kept me busy and if I were to start texting my husband instead of keeping 1000 things under control, the baby would start crying and thats bad for both the baby and also for the customers to hear a screaming gremlin, (even if its a cute gremlin)


Basically, my husband called me 3 and a half hours later VERY ANGRY that I wasnt responding to his texts. Personally I think that the reason why I wasnt responding isnt relevant if I was just [tryly busy] and also [only a few hours]. People are often busy and cannot update.

As soon as he called me on the phone I did pick up right away. He angrily went off on me for why wasnt I updating him. I told him that people are sometimes busy for a few hours and cant text and that this should be respected and understood but that did nothing to ease his anger. I would have updated him as soon as my hands were  free maybe 30 more mins into the future. His reasoning included:

- that me and my mother are two adults. we could have definitely set aside a few moments for giving a heads up
- he wasnt aware how long we'd be out in the city for
- he was worried about his child

am I the asshole here?

Now complete the following example-
input: Just some backstory here. I am currently living at my girlfriend's mum's house as a temporary arrangement due to undergoing spinal surgery in November 2018, as the shower and other facilities are easier for me to use due to my immobility. 

I purchased a pack of rather expensive Tesco's Finest Ham Off the Bone yesterday, in which you get four slices per pack. These are for my dinner to take to work as I work shifts.

Today, I was sat in the living room watching the football, when my girlfriend's Auntie walked in the house to take herself and her Mum out for clothes shopping. This was around 3:15pm in the afternoon. As her Auntie walked into the kitchen, she said she was hungry and hadn't had anything to eat. My girlfriend's Mum then offered her some snacks, or to make a sandwich for her. My girlfriend's Mum then opened the fridge, looked inside for sandwich filler and informed the Auntie that there was some ham. As it happened, there were two packs of ham. One had around 12 slices in, was a bit thinner than the ham I purchased but was by no means cheap and nasty. 

Now, when the Auntie looked at both packs of ham, she decided that she wanted the pack which I had bought, which contained only four slices, was expensive (£4.00) and was for work. The Mum then explained that the ham belonged to me, but that she's sure I wouldn't mind if she ate it. At this point, I explained that the ham was actually for my dinner at work and only has four slices in, which in fact aren't even large slices. They would be sufficient for one sandwich, as they are like bacon medallions but smaller. 

I said it was quite expensive as ham goes, and that I bought them for work. I then said what is wrong with the other ham? The silence was deafening. I went to sit back down in the living room, and my girlfriend came in to state how ""rude, selfish and ungrateful"" I am. I was incredibly surprised by this as my girlfriend in the past has actually made comment on how ill mannered and cheeky her Auntie can be when in someone else's house as a guest. 

This has now caused a rift, and I am now feeling ostracised and out of place, and to make matters worse, my girlfriend was supposed to be taking me out for a birthday meal tonight. But that has been cancelled, on her part. I'm in genuine shock.

Now complete the following example-
input: Sorry, I know the title is a mouth full.

&amp;#x200B;

So this just happened minutes ago, I live in a house with 8 people, including a one and a half year old boy who shoves literally everything in his mouth, ex: house phones, spoons, remotes, etc. Just anything that fits in his mouth. My sister lets him roam unsupervised a lot and makes other people watch him or she just leaves him alone for 10 minutes at a time so she can go smoke weed or cigarettes. She had a child outside of marriage and was pregnant while she used heroin, but quit when the baby boy was born so she could live with us and we could help care for the baby boy. Her boyfriend lives with us too under the condition that they both work. She and her boyfriend have smoked for the entire time the baby boy was growing in our house and I have no idea when they started smoking marijuana. We don't know how to handle them smoking pot since it's legal now so we decided to let it go and warned them it's a gateway drug.

&amp;#x200B;

Although I'm completely against the use of drugs/tobacco and I know she can choose how to spend her life doing whatever she wants, I just don't want that around her son who isn't capable of leaving the room is she smokes in it and doesn't know better than to not touch the cigarettes. I constantly find rolled joints and cigarettes, both used and unused, on the ground, on her bed (when she asks me to watch him) and on low tables. I tell my parents since they are the owners of the house and they told me not to start conflicts with her, but today I found a whole cigarette on the floor of the room her son plays in and my dad (a total hard ass) saw me pick it up and I brought it to my sister's bf to tell him I found it and it was dangerous. My dad then walked over and started telling him how he's repeatedly said no tobacco in the house and the bf just says it fell off from behind his ear (He perches his cigarettes there like you would a pencil). things go bad and there's arguing. then my sister comes down with her toddler and my dad reminds her about the no tobacco rule. She asks why I'm there and my dad says I'm the one who found the cigarette and I tell her that her son could choke on it or poison himself and she starts yelling we are all ganging up on her. I make her son a bottle of milk because he looks thirsty and I thought that's what she came down here to anyways, so i give it to her and tell her I'm not mad at her and she shoves me away.

&amp;#x200B;

I decide to let her cool off so I go upstairs and go to my room and lock the door, it's a habit. 5 minutes later, she's pounding at my door telling me it's my fault all this happened (my dad told her I showed him the cigarette) and that if her son doesn't have a father and leaves her because our dad yelled at her bf on his first day back from a trip, it's all my fault. Am I the Asshole? I don't know what to do

I just don’t care about new year and don’t want to see that person. 

I told them we can see each other a day after or before. I think they simply don’t respect my decision, they think I am being too stiff. Because it’s a public event, it does not require interaction, so you just should come, they say. I simply don’t agree.

Now complete the following example-
input: This is probably ridiculous to most, so prepare for overreaction drama! :)

&amp;#x200B;

Relevant backstory:

I'm not a fan of being in pictures and absolutely do not want any to appear online.

It's easy stopping myself, but less so other people - hence, I almost never agree to being in a picture and will usually either request I be left out or make sure it isn't going to be put online.

&amp;#x200B;

Reason is a background in computer tech and day-to-day job knowing full well the difficulty of removing data from the web, as well as how companies such as Facebook will use anything they have on you for marketing and less-than-moral purposes.

Call me paranoid, I just don't want it. I have absolutely no problem with other people doing this for themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

On to the actual story:

A while back someone uploaded a picture of me after promising me they wouldn't (the reason I agreed, as stated above), and I confronted them. Argument ensued, and in the end it ended up being deleted (but is it ever really?) after a lot of bullshit thrown at me that ""it isn't a big deal"" and ""everyone does it"" and a non-apology.

I ended up explaining my reasoning: It's not so much that people see it but that I do not wish to support businesses that thrive by selling user data.

Person below was a witness to these events.

&amp;#x200B;

A little while later (few weeks, tops) I agreed to being in a photo because the person asking is someone I care about and I knew it would make them happy. Same condition: No uploading, no Facebook.

This was agreed to, but I just found out that while they have refrained from posting it to a status, they have been sending it around using Messenger, saying it is not the same as 'putting it on Facebook'.

I get that this might not be the same thing from their POV, but to me it essentially is.

&amp;#x200B;

Both people in above stories were aware of my views on social media and photos.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that this is seen as normal stuff, and I do understand that most people do this freely and make no problem of it.

And yet, I can't shake feeling betrayed, even if it's something as stupidly meaningless as a photo, and even if they (thought they) were following our agreement.

&amp;#x200B;

AITA for getting upset about this?

Her boyfriend sent an invite to my GF and some of the girl’s other friends asking them to try to be there when they get back from the hike where he’s going to pop the question.  Thing is, the park is about an 8 hour drive, and we’d only be there for a night. This would also be right after traveling back from xmas and right before going back to work from the break.  

She sent me the screen shot of the invite and asked if I wanted to go.  I pretty much said that’s really far for one night and I don’t really know these people (I’ve met them 3-4 times...).  What I didn’t mention to her is that the people we’d be driving with make me very uncomfortable (very religious... pretty much most of what they talk about... I’m not into it at all) and being in a car for 16 hours over 2 days sounds like hell.

Ever since I said that I don’t want to go she’s been starting small fights about how I don’t want to do things she wants to and how I’m not good at committing to things.  Am I an asshole for not wanting to go this engagement party in the desert 8 hours away on New Years?

input: Tbh, the title pretty much says it all. Almost every time I'm visiting my mother(maybe once or twice a week), my sister calls. My mom will always drop whatever conversation we're having to answer the phone and will proceed to make me sit there and wait sometimes upwards of thirty minutes. She doesn't make any effort to politely reschedule the call. It'd be one thing if this happened once in a while but it's quite genuinely every time I'm over. It's even become a bit of a running joke.

Well, I'm sitting in her kitchen right now, after coming over to pick up some food for my sister's baby shower. My mom answers the door and doesn't greet me, and I realize she's on the phone again. I'm just sitting here and have been for 15 minutes and am frustrated because I can't stay long. WIBTA if I just left? I know she'd be livid, but it'd be rude interrupt her conversation too.

Now complete the following example-
input: Barely 20 years old, male. As a recent high school graduate who kept making excuses to push off applying to college, I was starting to get lonely and was losing friends to college. However, friend of a friend I haven't seen since high school shoots me a message. We will call her T. T asks me if I'd like to come over sometime and hang out with some of her friends, one of which was the one who was also my friend (who we'll call 'R'. I hadn't seen R in forever either. I was in.

We all end up having a great time. It was just me, T, R, and a new girl named H. We agree to do this more often, and start to meet up several times a week. Side note, my family is very poor, while T isn't at all. T would take me out to eat all of the time, which always made me feel kind of guilty but she would insist. She would also drive around, and just help me in general.

After about a month of the two, I notice that T had been a lot closer to me than usual, and is definitely dropping hints about liking me. However, I'm by no means looking for a relationship, so I choose to show my uninterest by ignoring every hint. After about a month she seemed to have given up and become content with the fact that we would just be friends.

Big detail for the next part is that T had never gotten drunk, despite being older than me. After another month  of us being strictly friends again, she tells me that she wants to try it with me and H. T makes it very clear H won't arrive there until late, but that doesn't really bother me so I agree anyways.

T drinks a little, I drink a lot, and we both become very drunk. Eventually, H shows up and I am plastered, as is T. H says she's tired and goes right to bed, which sucks as she said that pretty much upon walking in. T says she's tired too, and tells me to follow her. She asks if I'm okay laying next to her, I don't really care, but am definitely on edge at this point.

After some silence, she started to press her body closely against mine, and I sorta freaked out on her. Didn't yell or anything, but did raise my voice.

Since then I've not hung out with her again and it's been months. I can tell she's been upset about it, but every time she asks me to hang out it's abundantly clear she's trying to fuck. She makes it very obvious. AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: This has been bugging me for a little bit since I'm really not sure if I was wrong or right here. I felt like I was in the right and I still do, but I had nobody in the car and asking friends or family will just get my sympathy and not a real answer. A few days ago I was driving on the highway at about 65-70 MPH in the far left lane. In about a half mile I had to exit, so I signal to move to the right so I can prepare for that. There's someone directly in front of me with an open space to my right and ahead of that space, another car. There's also a car slightly further back from that space. I've been signalling for a few seconds and the space is still clear. The car in front of my soon-to-be position is not braking and has nobody in front of him for a good while, so I feel safe getting behind him since I would only be there for a few moments before moving right again to my exit lane. I begin the turn, and as I start to leave my lane - blinker still on - someone I will refer to as ""the guy"" who was behind that space starts driving forward into the spot I would soon occupy and had been signalling to enter.

&amp;#x200B;

I keep moving into this spot because I'm not about to pull back into my lane, get boxed in, and miss my exit. I was signalling, I had plenty of room to maneuver into that space, and not only did he practically stand on the horn when I did this, he continued to drive forward almost to BLOCK me from getting into that spot. Technically, I believe he DID have right of way, but for what purpose? He'd just be tailgating the guy in front of him and blocking me from leaving. I'd have to slow down significantly to get behind him and start moving over, which slows down everyone else in my lane.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of it, he moved to the right, letting me in, and sped off. So, am I the asshole here? The only thing I may have done wrong in my mind is not having enough space between myself and the car in front of me when I moved over, but I preferred that over not giving the person behind me space: I knew the guy in front of me had nobody in front of him and wouldn't have much of a reason to stomp the brakes, I was paying close attention, and I didn't even plan on being in that lane for more than a couple seconds before moving right again. Also: what's your opinion on people who pass on the right, blocking others from getting to exits? I've always thought that if you want to pass someone, do it on the left so that they're not being blocked from moving over towards the most common side of the road for exits.

Now complete the following example-
input: I (F22), just graduated college and took a gap year cuz of reasons I'm gonna enlist below. 

So pausing for a minute to give a family BG. I am the youngest out of 5 sisters. So around 4 years ago, around this time, all of my sisters either got married or got incredible career offers and moved away from our not so big, humble city. Leaving me behind with our parents to take care of. Now, before it irks you, my parents are old and my dad has glaucoma, so they need one of us to be there for them. 

Where I'm from, it's not frowned upon if you don't go away for college but it's still something that has started to catch on with people here. Of course, it did so with me too, and when I had to stay back for my degree, I got thrown into a mess of depression, anxiety and low self confidence. I have blamed everyone for making me stay back, and for my mental health deteriorating. But never to their faces, because they try, they really really do! But they don't do enough, and I swear I don't blame them.

However, in these 3-4 years, my father apparently saw this ability in me to excel in our family business (I have helped him with many things in his business, and gradually started doing so quite regularly). He now wants me to stay back and get into the business full-time, and not leave for my higher studies. 

So, am I the asshole for wanting to go out for 2 years to see what is out there and then make the decision? Also, do I sound extremely bratty for having this cushion of having the business to get back to when all else fails, and yet still almost cribbing about it? 

TL;DR Father wants me to get into family business, while I want to go out for higher studies for at least 2 years and weigh my options then.

Now complete the following example-
input: So I made this throwaway account to ask this since my bf uses reddit sometimes. I'll try to make it short. 

This morning we made plans to meal prep and then workout so I got to his place before stores opened to avoid rush hour traffic. We talk for a few minutes in his bedroom about me leaving in the afternoon and we might as well workout now then meal prep after. As we start to leave he spends 20 min in the bathroom which is fine no big deal then he makes a smooothie. He makes one every mornign so I'm just waiting on the couch. Then I see him start to empty the trash bin to throw it away. I say with some attitude, ""What are you doing?"" and he says ""Throwing out the trash, its full"". It really was flowing out as there was another bag of trash next to it already but I didnt see the point of him start to clean as we were about to leave. This is where I give him attidude and say, ""Don't do that"" and ""You're wasting time"". And this is when he snaps at me and loudly says, ""I feel like you're trying to control my life right now"" and other sentences about why he cant throw the trash away if its full. I tell him beacause his apartment is already mostly messy and dirty and throwing the trash away when we are leaving and I have a set time to leave wont make a difference. As I'm saying this without even raising my voice he loudly says, ""CALM DOWN"" four times at me and to stop talking. So I do and we move on with the day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now he does admit that his place is mostly dirty and that he is starting new daily clean habits to change it. Anyways later in the day its brought up again because I dont feel he should've snapped like that. The exact morning as I got to his place he rushed me in and was rude when I took two stops becase I have a broken toe and I took a second to allow him to unlock the door. I mentioned he can be just as rude sometimes and say rude remarks with attitude and I never escalate the sitaution or get loud or anything. I just ignore it and move on so I expect the same from him. He says that he NEVER wants any attitude at all directed towards him and if he ever gives me attitude again I should call him out on it instead of saying nothing. I feel thats impossible to never give even a little attitude when I dont see it as anything personal. I told him he should act the same way I do instead of always giving attitude back. So reddit am I the asshole thinking its impossible to never give attitude?

Now complete the following example-
input: For some context, I am a senior in high school and I have broken off all contacts with a previous friend. We used to be great friends from when we were Young, but because of certain actions she's taken I now avoid her.

First off when we were still on good terms we would talk and joke about many things, however she would tend to gossip about other friends. While she wasn't necessarily rude and disrespectful some comments were a bit disconcerting.

Secondly during our sophomore year in high school we made plans to go to our winter formal as friends. However the day before she informed me she was no longer going and was going with someone else. Granted we decided to go as friends and I was perfectly fine with her going with someone she liked, but it was hurtful to be informed so late.

During that same year she was having some car trouble and I helped her jump start her car. However the next day I learned that the car I helped jump-start was not hers and that she ran away out of state. well I was not punished since I knew nothing of her plan, I felt betrayed in a sentence since she used me like that.

During our junior year she was having some trouble with her family. And her personality seemed to change. She started to have some falling outs with my other friends, And her comments on people became more vindictive. We still talked and hang out but there was always this growing sense of dread in the back of my mind.

During this current year we have not talked much due to school work and getting ready for college. However on occasion we did talk but I no longer saw her as a friend. Eventually I stopped talking to her all around and avoid her. I hear different stories going on with her, and have this unpleasant satisfaction of no longer having to deal with her.

but the reason why I'm bringing this up is because last week she confronted me on why I no longer talk to her. Granted I was not kind with the words I spoke but I don't feel remorseful for avoiding her, and now she and her friends despise me. So am I the a****** for avoiding and ditching her in a sentence.

Now complete the following example-
input: I am relatively new to the subreddit and decided I should participate more than just by casting judgement on others. I guess it is my turn to be judged.

This happened some time ago.

My grandfather and I were super close. Essentially he played the role of my father. We were best friends.

He worked as an operator at a steel refinery. He was one of the guys that controlled the huge machines that put the billets on the rollers etc. It was a physically toxic environment which resulted in emphysema as well as lung cancer.

Near the end of his life, he suffered a heart attack which landed him in hospital. The family rallied around him, and we would take turns visiting him, taking care of him, taking his favorite snacks / magazines etc. We all spent a lot of time in the hospital with him just to make sure he wasn't lonely.

At this time, I was in training for a new job and was in the final evaluation phase. During the last week, we were called to the hospital by the doctors on three different occasions to ""say goodbye"" - the doctors were convinced he wouldn't make it through the night each time. Granted, his organs were shutting down one by one and was basically only alive because he was hooked up to a dialysis machine. 

Keep in mind, each time we got the call from the doctors, we all took our turns saying good bye. He was no longer conscious at this point. We were all shattered, basically having our final words with him each time. Each time we got the call, we dropped everything so that we could go through to see him.

On the day that he died, we got another call from the hospital saying that we should come say good bye to him. This time, I refused to go. I had already said my good-byes and was way too emotionally raw to have to go through it again. Part of me felt that we would just get the same call the next day, and the next after that. I think I was in denial that he was actually dying, telling myself that he will pull through it. Needless to say, he passed away that same day, and since then I have carried a lot of guilt with me for not going the last time. 

AITA for not going one final time?

Now I got into poly when i was about 18. I was dating a girl who i loved more then anything. She was great but always wanted to have other partners. Took me a while to agree. But eventually we agreed to til she started talking about another guy I told her to cut it off and I dont want her sleeping with him again. She got upset but agreed. I didnt like their fling because we said never talk about or other partners. Well she said she wanted to change a rule and we should tell each other about our partners. I reluctantly agreed. So we talked about all our partners. I flet a little guilty after hearing shes been with about 5 other guys in the 6 months we opened our relationship. Cause I  had been with basically 4x the amount give or take. She was extremely upset. Literally the next day I come over to her dorm as she asked. And shes getting fucked by this guy. I literally threw up. Broke up with her that instant. Never spoke to her again. Even though she tried really hard. I didnt care. Didnt date anyone till I met my current girlfriends. That was like 2 years after the breakup. 

Another commenter told me it wasnt healthy that I didnt want my girlfriends to fuck other guys. They have never asked me to. And I said when we started this relationship that I wouldn't want them too. They both said they never even thought about another guy. And to be honest I dont sleep with other girls without one of them being there. So I'm not sleeping with anyone else but them.

Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

Am I the asshole for wanting to wear the shirt I made just once?

Now complete the following example-
input: For context I have two friends (who we will call Steph and Lola) who recently started hanging out more. Now Steph is very self centered and attention seeking. One of Lola's friends has compared her to a leech or a parasite. Steph picks very specific people,to be her friends. If you are friendly but a pushover she makes friends with you. Now Lola is going to a different school then her good friends next year so Steph stepped in. Steph has been very inconsiderate of Lola's feelings. Steph will get packed a full lunch and Lola will pay for hers, Steph will throw all of hers away(or hand it off) and eat ALL of Lola's food instead. Lola has a few different anxities which make it hard for her to make friends. I dont want Lola stuck in a bad friendship with Steph like I personally did. Me and Steph have had MANY problems before this (I have posted about one before) and this is it. Lola,seems unbothered though and just does whatever Steph asks. I feel stupid asking but I wanted to so I was sure before I did it. 

TL;DR- I want to end a bad friendship a girl is stuck in. Someone is taking advantage of her anxiety but she seems to be unbothered. Would I Be The Asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: Some context ~ back in September one of my friends, S, took his own life. We hadn't had much contact other than homeroom a couple weeks before, so I found out a few days after it happened and took a day off of school, since I was upset about this and didn't think I would be able to go all day without crying. I knew him well enough to call him my friend, we talked to each other in passing, and he was such a nice, sweet guy. He was always smiling, super happy go lucky, and it just made me laugh and smile to be around him. I never would have expected him to do something like take his own life, but I guess he hid it well.

His girlfriend, J, who was my friend for several years before I had gotten to know S, was also deeply affected by this and stopped coming to school for about a month and a half. All she would post to any of her social media would be pictures of her and S. She acted like he was still alive. I was really worried about her and was super relieved when I saw her again. I knew she was struggling, like all of us. 

It was only recently that I felt okay to start talking about S again. I shared stories about him during lunch with our other friends, and we all laughed and cried together. After lunch, however, J pulled me aside. Here's basically what she said:

J: Could you please stop acting like you know S that well? You weren't even friends. 

I had known him longer than she had known him, so I was a bit taken aback by this and got angry. 

Me: You were dating for what, half a year? He was my friend. I'm allowed to get upset. Maybe he didn't think of me as a friend, maybe he didn't talk about me all that much, but I considered him my friend, and you can't take that away from me. 

J: He wasn't your friend and you know it. We were together for almost a year. He never mentioned you. You hung out with him outside of school once. 

Me: At least I don't go around posting his pictures all over snapchat like woe is me, my boyfriend is dead. It's not like you were going to be together for the rest of your lives. It was a high school relationship! 

J walked away and stopped talking to me after that. She called me an asshole and basically stopped coming to lunch. All of our other friends were alright with this, cause she had apparently been invalidating their relationship with S too. I understand that she's grieving, but so are we. 

So AITA here? Did I take it too far?

Now complete the following example-
input: Some context- my friend group and I have a very crude, nasty sense of humor. Basically we are 14 year olds in 24/25 year old bodies. We often joke about weird sex stuff, and we love to bust each others balls whenever we get the chance. Outsiders might think we have an ""offensive"" type of humor, and they might think we are being genuinely mean to one another but we show our love through jokes and sarcasm. 

This one friend was back in town after moving away for a few months, and when we all got together yesterday I noticed he grew a mustache, so the first thing out of my mouth was, ""Hey man, nice stash. You look like our neighborhood sex offender!""

He got weirdly offended and walked away into the mall, where we were meeting up. My friends thought it was funny he was barely said two words to me the rest of the night. 

So, AITA? Or has he just forgotten how harsh our sense of humor can be? Trust me, it wasnt that bad compared to other things we joke about. 


Tldr- Me and friend group have nasty immature sense of humor, friend who we havent seen grew a mustache and I told him he looks like a sex offender and he got upset.

Now complete the following example-
input: 
My partner's parents have been visting from overseas. They stayed with us for three weeks, left for a trip over Christmas and are staying with us another week before flying back home.

We live in a one-bedroom apartment and they are sleeping on a mattress on our living room floor. They clean up after themselves, help cook, pay for groceries etc. They also try and do activities outside the apartment most days.

Thing is, I am nearing the end of my university studies. My PhD thesis is due in a month and I am working from home to write it up. I am getting sick of them hanging around and have not engaged with them much on this second visit, I try find excuses to be out when they are around and don't make an effort to make conversation. Obviously my partner recognises my discomfort but can't kick them out at this stage and just wants me to make peace with my situation.

Does my not-give-a-fuckery about their visit and desire to have them out of my house make me an asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: Ive been with my (24m) current partner (23f) for close to 6 years now and I love her to pieces, shes extremely sweet and bubbly. Kindest person Ive ever met.  
  
To get to the point, one drawback she has is she loves spending time with me, all the time, and never gets bored or tired of it. Which Ive always found very sweet and endearing. However Ive always been quite introverted and I really need my space to myself from time to time to recharge.  
  
Recently she moved in with me, I was hesitant but the living situations for both her and my other flatmate lined up so I figured we'd give it a shot, and now she has her own room in the house.  
  
However, she never uses her room she pays rent for, so shes always in my room on my bed wanting to chat or watching netflix on her laptop which causes constant noise of Vampire Diaries and the like. If I leave the room to go to the kitchen she follows me, if Im typing on my computer she asks me what im typing about. Just constantly shes in my space and wanting to be involved with what im doing, and I appreciate and love the place where thats coming from. But the constant state of having someone In my space was starting to really drive me mad and I was growing resentful and agitated more and more.  
  
So I told her one day when she asked me why I seemed grumpy with her. I explained in as gentle terms as I could that every now and then I need my own room to myself and need space from others. That it isnt to do with her, its to do with me and how I am as a person. I need me time. She didn't take it very well as this concept is very foreign to her, shes very extroverted and loves my company 24/7.  
  
Shes taken it personally, and despite my telling her that she could be anyone and Id still need my time to myself shes insisting that im getting sick of HER as apposed to getting sick of not having MY OWN SPACE.  
  
AITA?
output: ",telling my partner that I need more space from her

input: I (22F) live with my boyfriend (24M). We're both on the lease for my current apartment. I have two cats, a hamster and a mouse. I have wanted to get a dog for years, ever since I had to put down my childhood dog. I think it will help with my anxiety and depression issues as well as just be a great addition to my life. With our current apartment we have a fenced in yard and what I think is enough space to add a medium sized dog. I take care of all the animals, since they are mine, and would do the same with the new dog. My boyfriend has had to feed the cats like once or twice mostly when I was out of town but otherwise does nothing for their care. I want to start looking for a dog to rescue and add to my family. He doesn't think we have enough space and doesn't want to live with a dog ""yet"". We're planning to stay in this apartment for a while, so I don't know why the space would be an issue now and not later. I asked what I could do to help him feel ready for a dog and he didn't have an answer. I'm currently working part time and in school full time with most of my classes being online. This means my schedule is flexible and I'm home most days, which seems perfect for introducing a new pup. I feel like he'll never be ""ready"" to live with, not even take care of, a dog and that since he won't have to do anything with the dog it shouldn't be that big of a deal to get one. So what do you guys think? WIBTA if I get a dog?

I'm a digital and traditional artist and in one of my classes we create t shirts and things (socks, lanyards, water bottles, stickers, you name it). I'm a big fan of putting my art on t shirts so I can sell them.

M wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

Am I the asshole for wanting to wear the shirt I made just once?

input: I started my second semester of school a couple of days ago and my first class of the day is a philosophy class. I sit down in the middle row of the classroom about halfway up an isle and a bit later a guy sits in front of me, no biggie, he’s not tall or anything so I don’t have to worry about not seeing the board or anything like that. Halfway through my instructor talking about philosophy stuff, the guy in front of me starts playing with his hair. 

Now I’m not talking just scratching it and stopping, he is twirling his fingers in it over and over again. Not on the side, but on the top of his head. He twirls a strand of hair and then lets it fall, and then does the same thing again and again. If that isn’t enough, he is stretching out his arms to do this as well, so anything I wanted to see on the board is now difficult to read. 

I plan to switch seats so I don’t have to be distracted by that, but I just wanted to know if my initial annoyance was stupid or not. 

TLDR: The guy sitting in front of me in class twirls his hair constantly making it difficult to read the board and pay attention to my professor, AITA for being annoyed by this? 
output: ",being annoyed at the guy sitting in front of me in class

input: I made a shit post about this in the past thinking it would sort it self out but it actually hasn't. For information these toilets only have one toilet in them so I can understand if the female is already being used. They go in there when the female isn't in use so other girls can go to the toilet.

I work in an office with one other guy and six girls. I've had this problem since working here that the girls do there make up in the males toilet every morning. The first time it happened I was ok and told them to stop it but this morning I stood by the water machine to wait for them. When one of the girls was heading into the male toilet to do her make-up I got up from my desk followed her and said 'What do you think you're doing'. She tried to get out of the situation but I proceeded to not just tell her but all the females in the office that it is a male toilet and not a female and how would they feel if I went into the female toilet to shave every morning. After this charade I have been given the deadliest of evils from all these girls for the past week. 

Was it really ass-holey of me to block the girl and tell them off about going into the male toilet.

Now complete the following example-
input: I’ll refer to my best friend as “M” and her other best friend as “V”. 

M and I are extremely close. She’s always there for me when I’m struggling as I’m always there for her. M and I are really similar in personality, we’re both extremely empathetic and selfless because we had similar childhoods where we had to take on a lot of responsibilities at a young age. I really appreciate M and she’s probably the only person in my life I’d consider a real good friend who’d probably still be with me when we’re old grandmas. 

There’s been this problem bugging M for about a year now, and it’s gotten to a point where it started affecting me as well. Her other “best friend” V, makes everything really complicated. I don’t even know where to begin because there’s just so much going on with her. For one, V just seems like she uses M. Like if her other friends are not there and she’s all alone, she’ll come running to M acting like they’re besties. She treats M like a substitute and it pisses me off. And it’s not just me noticing this or making an assumption that she is using her as a replacement to not look like a loner, but M feels this way as well. She confided in me multiple times telling me how V makes her uncomfortable and how she feels that she’s only using her. 

Second of all, what really annoys me, is that V seems to lack basic consideration for other people. V recently moved, so she had to transfer to another school. We’re seniors in high school, so it was our last homecoming and M and I were planning on making the most out of it with just us two going out to eat together and enjoying the time. Our school has guest forms to invite students from other schools to our homecoming, and V asked M at the last minute to guest her and eat dinner with her, even though she knew that M and I already had plans together. It was kind of infuriating because they had literally gone to every dance together in the past years and she can’t even let me spend one dance with M? 

You’re probably wondering why we can’t just go all together, but it’s really awkward and uncomfortable. I don’t really know how to explain it, but I keep getting these vibes off of V like she’s jealous of how close M and I have been getting because whenever I’m with M, she’ll start acting overly clingy to M and keeps calling her “my number one best friend” while glancing back at me. 

V also had a pretty fucked up childhood because her dad sexually abused her, and I feel really terrible about that. She struggles with depression and had bad problems with cutting . So when V asks to hang out, M always feels like she can’t say no because she doesn’t want to hurt V’s feelings. I’m also afraid of hurting V’s feelings so I have never said anything of what I feel towards her. I’ve always been really nice to her but I feel bad that I’m being fake in that way when I truly don’t like her at all. 

These days M has been really stressed out not knowing how to deal with V because their friendship is honestly just super toxic. V calls her best friend, but she really doesn’t treat her like one at all. M has been asking me for advice on what to do, and I told her to just start distancing herself from V. But I know that’s gonna be really hard because we’re both scared of hurting V since she’s so sensitive, and we don’t want to make her fall into an even deeper depression. She may not be the best person, but we still care about her. She’s gone through a lot worse things than M and I could ever imagine. But I don’t want M being friends with her just out of pity. AITA for telling her to distance herself from V?

Now complete the following example-
input: So I live in Australia and I'm about to enter the last year of my degree at uni. Once I get halfway through next year I won't receive financial support from the government anymore so I don't think I'll be able to afford to live out of home anymore. I do work but I don't want to work more than 15 hours a week so I still do alright at uni, plus my job is average. 

But the problem is my parents are insisting I can't live at home anymore because I'm too old to live with them according to them. I sort of agree with them but I have plenty of mates my age (25) that still live at home with their parents, at least half of them do. Plus I don't know if I really have a choice because I don't think I'll be able to afford to live out of home. I think I'd only have to live with them for a year and a half assuming I get a scholarship for my PHD which I'd say I have a decent chance of getting. I really don't want to get a job when I finish my degree as I want to go into research and I study psychology and it's better to do postgraduate study usually.

I don't know I'm sort of conflicted. On one hand I don't want to live at home with them especially because they live half an hour away from my university and because it's sort of shameful to live with your parents at my age. But I think it'd be nice and Id like to spend more time with my family I just don't want to be there if they really don't want me there.

Now complete the following example-
input: Alright, so we're group of 6 15 year olds (including me), basically your typical group of teenagers. Think of a less exaggerated, ""relationship-less"" version of the kids from That 70s Show. Three of these people I've known since the 7th grade (my school is both a middle school and a high school, that's why we're still in contact), and the other two I met recently in the start of 10nth grade. September of 2018 is when we all started hanging out, and it is now mid/late-January 2019.

Last week, 4 of those 6 members (once again including me), recently met up in one of those 4 people's houses, and we started playing truth or dare. Us almost always pussying out of dares and almost always saying truth got us in a serious mood, as we all had to respond to things such as ""What would you do if all of us died and you had to choose which one was going to live?"", ""Honestly rate everyone in the 'gang' individually"", or ""What is your greatest fear?"", but we were still playful non the less.

Things got even more serious however when we all went out for a short walk, and one of my friends started telling us about traumatic experiences of hers, and then told us a specific one with more detail. Another one of my friends said very vaguely that he had a similar experience, and the other one didn't say anything. We got back to the friends house and it was getting late so we had to live. After hearing my friends' stories, I was in the mood to tell them one of my own, but we had ran out of time so I told them that I would tell them next time we all met.

Now, here's the internal conflict. As I got home, I started evaluatimg my decision to tell them the story. My friends' stories took place when they were around 11, but mine was much more recent, much more complicated, and involved a lot more people, most of which are other friends of mine (to sum up the story without getting into detail, me and another group of friends had our summers and states of mind ruined by someone who was being a controlling, manipulative, and bitter cunt ""friend"" we all had to put up with). I thought maybe that I shouldn't tell them, for the following reasons:
1) This story goes beyond me. Other friends who were involved in it might not like the story being told to anyone else. I feel that it would be incredibly disrespectful to them and what we've all been through to just put what happened out there (especially since some people from both circles know eachother).
2) One of the people who was involved in the situation (who is in both 'gangs') specifically asked me NOT to tell the story to anyone, and I would like to respect his desire.
3) While I do thing the guy who caused my trauma was being an absolute asshole, I still find it disrespectful to tell this story, since he's not entirely that bad (I also place some of the blame on me for what happened), and he was also a young teenager at the time, which would make it sort of justifiable for him to make poor and selfish decisions. Besides, after this experience I'm sure he'll change, if he hasn't already (maybe I'm being too naive, but oh well)
4) Their stories were significantly less fucked up and impactful than mines is, so them insisting that I tell it to them because they told me theirs, especially after I've explained this is not really the most respectful thing to do (but more on that later).
To sum up, I trust those people, but some things are better to keep to yourself.


So, here comes Monday, we're in recess and someone from the group reminds me that I haven't told them the story yet, and I say that I'm not sure if I should tell them, explaining my first and last reasons only to them, but they are still pressuring me to tell them (not at the point where I'm stressed out, but to the point where I just feel a little annoyed and disrespected), although one of them did show some understanding.

It's Wednesday, and they're still bringing it up. Now, it's my mistake that I told them that I would tell the story in the first place, as I didn't think it through, and I should tell them the other reasons, however they're pretty stubborn. I do see where they're coming from, as it probably took a lot out of them to tell their own stories, and the mere thought of not telling them makes feel like an asshole. I've explained that I trust them 100% (and that me meeting them fairly recently does not affect that), and if I had any other traumatic stories similar to theirs I would totally tell them, just not this one.

input: My mother’s health is not the best. She deals with high blood pressure from alcoholism, no exercise (she gets out of breath just standing up), and poor diet consisting of fast food, soda, and sweets one would find in the snack aisles. 

Yet she always insists on coming with my father and me to stuff that requires physical exertion, such as a festival, the beach, museum, or a company picnic. Every time we take her to those places, she is dead weight. Always complaining about it being hot, her being hungry, or having to walk. We always end up leaving early and just going back home. 

To me, it doesn’t make sense for her to go if all she will ever do is complain and force us to cancel or leave early. This weekend is a company picnic, and she insists on going. I told her she can’t go if she doesn’t start caring about her health. Stop buying soda by the gallons. Stop drinking wine every night. Go to the mail box a few times a day. Instead of eating one meal a day made up of crappy junk food, eat three meals with healthy food. Of course I get the “I’m the parent you’re the child” argument. But if she truly wants to start doing stuff with my dad and me, she needs to start working on a healthier lifestyle. We’re done with her coming along only to drag us down.

Now complete the following example-
input: So, this happened my senior year of high school.

My best friend (we'll call her Lura) started dating this sentient dab of sour cream wearing cowboy boots, we'll call him SC. I was very happy for Lura since this is the first time she's ever dated! SC was friends with my boyfriend (now ex) and seemed pretty harmless at first until he started to show his true colors. He would insult Lura's art and call her intrest in anime stupid. Kinda shitty but whatever.

Then, SC started to become very possessive of Lura. So possessive that he would immediately take her to his car after school (which was weird on its own), not letting her hang out with her friends until her mom picks her up.  He would complain if he saw Lura with me or any of her other friends, saying he was being neglected. He wanted to know *everything* about her. Someone had told her a confidential secret, and SC kept pressing about wanting to know. He then guessed that it was about me, which it wasn't, and thought I was transgender because I was one of the few girls at my school to  wear pants year round. 

Fast forward towards the final few months of our senior year, I had acquired SC's number for some reason and my trust in him had dwindled drastically. I had KIK at the time and his profile popped up on there. My profile was called Altan, the name of one of my characters that is Mongolian. I decided to shoot the piss and contact SC. I acted like I had never met him before to see if I could find out some random things about him. I made up a bs story about living in Mongolia but my dad got a job in the US so we moved there. *He actually bought it.*

We would continue to chat for a few weeks and I had won his trust I guess. I had asked him if he had a girlfriend because I needed ""dating advice."" SC told me he had a busty chick with a big ass (Lura) but was also fucking this other girl.

*HE THEN SENT ME NUDES OF HIS SIDE CHICK*

This was all the evidence I needed. After reverse image searching the picture to make sure it wasnt some random thot, I took screenshots and planned to show Lura at school after discussing it with another friend of mine.

Redemption Day comes. I reveiled the receipts to Lura and, of course, she was devistated. She broke up with him a couple of days later despite him trying to object about it all. Toxic relationships over and I told SC I was Altan. SC was pissed but I felt like I had done the right thing.

Sitting back and looking at it now, it's been 4 years, I don't know if it was an asshole move of me or not to initiate the breakup. I didn't trust SC with my best friend at all and I could tell his possessive nature was affecting Lura.

I mean, today she is happily engaged and living her best life. SC had a shotgun wedding with some chick that has more testosterone then he will ever have, but I've never seen him since.

TL;DR: Catfished a possessive and cheating piece of shit that was dating my best friend, they broke up.

Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet.

Now complete the following example-
input: Long one, so strap in, and thank you for your patience. 

I met ‘John’ through a mutual friend. He hosted a tabletop group that was looking for new players. I joined, and clicked really well with the group, one of them being the mutual friend. Since they were looking for more people, I invited 2 of my best friends, and my brother, all of whom were experienced players too. 

A couple months into the 1.5ish years we all played together, my brother and I started having table issues, mainly due to differing approaches to role playing in a group (the actual problem isn’t important, but the conflict itself is). A few other people in our 7 total people had issues with each other too, and John asked everyone individually what the problems are and what can be changed, with the express intent of getting everybody good with each other and getting back into the game properly. After collecting our answers, he instead called the game off completely.

He left everyone off with “while we all can’t get along in the same game, I still want to game with everyone in separate groups”. He told me directly that he would let me know when the next game was happening, and wanted to get together to paint some miniatures. A few months go by, and I hear nothing. 

As I’m locked in radio silence with John, our mutual friend tells me that they’ve had a couple paint nights and started a new game since then. The reason I was given was that they “didn’t want to offend me or my brother by inviting one over the other”. Both of us aren’t bothered by that at all. He kept finding excuses not to ever have me around, but I still got invited to his and his wife’s bday parties, and his New Years party. 

Fast forward a few more months, and my best friend want to get the group back together and record our sessions. We all agree, with the first order of business being to have a sit down lunch, talk about the game, and air out any issues we have. All of us players got our stressors out, and even my brother and I came to a mutual understanding of the mindset we would have with our characters. John did not contribute anything other than how we can streamline our gaming experience. 

We leave happy, and get together for a character creation session the next week. We get their, and John is much more frazzled. He was edgy, and at one point, got into it with my brother over a rule. I broke that argument up, and it mainly involved getting my brother to drop the subject, cause he kept re-instigating the issue. 

In the email chain after this, I was debating a home brew race with John, and he blew up, citing “people who can’t be mature” and saying “I expected more growth out of certain people”. 

I ended up emailing him directly, and jumped his shit about not being able to tell me directly if he has a problem with me. I called him out about trying to ghost me with gaming, and told him that if he doesn’t want to keep the friendship, or if he just doesn’t want me gaming with him, he needs to be upfront instead of telling everyone different reasons about why we “keep missing each other”. I also told him he doesn’t get to talk about maturity and growth when he throws a fit whenever someone disagrees with him. 

He assured me that I wasn’t the problem, and my brother was, and that he always liked me more than my brother. He did admit that he still felt tension between my brother and I, and it was “bringing out the worst in” me.  He also doubled down that he was looking forward to gaming with me again, and he hopes everything works out. 

I talked to my best friend (the one who set up the new game) and told him everything that was said, and he informed me that his conversation with John prior to this game was that John preferred my brother over me, and all kinds of other shit that was the exact opposite of what I was told. We talked to my brother, who had gotten another story that contradicts ours. 

I let it sit for a week, and found out yesterday that John has proceeded to continue game prep without me, and my best friend was under the impression that John informed me of this decision. He had not. 

At this point, I know that I am an asshole for HOW I emailed him. I could have talked to him much calmer from the outset. I think he is so afraid of conflict that he just tells people what they want to hear.  When I talked to my wife, she suggested that even bringing it up at all was in bad taste. Honestly, I’ve deleted his number and email, and have taken the stance that I don’t want to deal with someone who can’t be upfront with me. I’ve told him before that I wouldn’t be offended by him not wanting to hang out or game with me. My only offense taken is that he can’t just tell me. 

So, finally, how do you all feel. 

Am I the asshole for emailing him to set things straight? Or only in how I did it?

And am I an asshole for just dropping the friendship all together, and chalking it up to “shit happens”?

Thank you so much for your patience in reading this.

Now complete the following example-
input: So, for context: this is a friend whom I've known for nearly a decade. We both love cats and each have a few of our own. A couple years ago I moved away from our hometown to a different state well across the country. Being in a long distance friendship where we went months without seeing each other, she would often snapchat me pictures of her cats as a conversation opener and a way to keep in touch, and I would reciprocate as well. This past summer, she ended up moving about an hour away from me for work and (unrelated) personal reasons. We now get to see each other (and each other's cats) a few times a month depending on our schedules. It's been awesome having her and her furry companions close at hand... however, the snaps of her cats have only increased in frequency to the point where I get anywhere from five to fifteen a day, every day. Often they are not really ""unique"" pictures (her cat laying on the bed or sitting on the couch in the same pose, day after day) and usually don't have any captions. (Or if they do, the captions are merely commenting on the cuteness of her cats.) I understand her sentiments, Reddit! I love cats passionately and she has objectively adorable cats. But it's annoying to get flooded with so many snaps... especially when I've stopped responding to them in any capacity but they haven't slowed down. I've gotten to the point where I'm sick of seeing them period. WIBTA if I asked her to stop sending the snaps altogether?

input: I (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don’t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it’s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I’ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it’s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.

Last night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have “normal” sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn’t really like.  I told him I didn’t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn’t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.

I haven’t answered his messages today. AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: I had an hour long drive home from a flight, mostly on an interstate through countryside in the dark. I typically drive 5 mph over the speed limit, but I'll often speed up when passing other cars. Most cars were driving a little slower and no one was in the left lane, so I got in the left lane to pass them slowly (I sped up a little). Eventually, a car flashed its brights at me from a distance behind me. I responded by speeding up a bit more (to about 8-9 mph over the speed limit), and looking for a gap in the right lane.

I soon found a small gap, where I pulled into that lane to give him a brief opportunity to pass me, but I reentered the left lane because I reached the end of that gap before he even caught up with me. When he caught up, he flashed me multiple times, as I was looking for another gap in the right lane.

When I found a longer gap, I pulled into the right lane again, and he passed me. As he passed, I looked at him to judge him, which he hard countered by flipping me off.

I might have overreacted, because he had the gall to flash his brights repeatedly AND flip me off, even though I was trying to be accommodating. I thought he felt entitled to have the passing lane to himself. After he passed, I left my brights on a for a few seconds to push back against his behavior (I figured it was justified, since he flashed me repeatedly). He responded by break checking me.

At that point, I gave up because I felt that he was playing a game of chicken at dangerous speeds. I saw/memorized his license plate in case he escalated further, but he soon took his exit. I regretted using my brights, and it was kind of a wakeup call about how dangerous people can be on the road.

AITA for getting in his way / responding with my brights? Is there any safe / appropriate way to push back against bad behavior on the road, or is no response the best response?

Now complete the following example-
input: For as long as I can remember my sister has wished for a puppy. But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed ""Devil's Sausage"" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.

I'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.

Last we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.

I wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. 

The day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:

* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.
* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.
* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.
* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.
* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance
* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt
* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment

A few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog

My Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.

Now complete the following example-
input: While I was a student i had a part time job at this charity as a carer for kids with disabilities. We had a new project that was being developed and I was very excited to get the role of project coordinator. The project was set up to last a year, but about half way through I finished uni and qualified as a nurse. I had planned to continue my part time job while working full time just to see the project to completion, but unfortunately this would beach the terms of my new nursing contact (couldn't work for any other care company). I handed in my resignation but stayed on as a volunteer to see the project to completion,  help them bid for another years funding and train my successor. At first I was still coming in every week (we were only open one day a week any way) but as I got busier and busier in my new role I started coming less and less. The project finished in December (though it was successfully renewed for another year) and I haven't been in since then. I said I would still pop by and help out every now and then but I've been very busy with work and somehow it's now march and I still haven't been in. 

Late December I found out they nominated me for a young leaders award for my continued support as a volunteer. Today I got a message saying that tickets for the award ceremony had arrived, and would I come and collect them or did they need to post them. I'm not actually working the day they want me to collect them, but... It's my only day off, if I pop in I'll feel obliged to stay and help out, and I feel like an aashole for not collecting them. Especially because the award was for my continued voluntary service, which has now basically stopped since I got the award. I didn't plan it that way, and honestly I think I'd feel less guilty if they haven't given me an award at all. 

Would I be an asshole if I let them post the tickets, collect my award then essentially wish them well but cut ties (and no longer continue to visit to help out). It's too late to nominate someone else for the award. Out should I suck it up and continue to occasionally help out and visit for a few more months so it doesn't look like my leaving is coinciding with collecting my award?

Now complete the following example-
input: My Grandad’s health has been up and down for a while and he’s been in hospital for a few weeks now. We’ve recently been told he has pneumonia and that some of the food he has been eating and drinking (this is very little as he hasn’t been eating well since my Nan passed in 2016) has been going into his lungs. We’ve been asked about a DNR and the doctors have said that he’s deteriorating fast. I’m going to visit him tonight and I’m hoping that things will improve but they aren’t very sure.  
  
My boyfriend lives about 2 hours train ride from me and we see each other nearly every 4 days off he has (he works 4 on and 4 off). Originally he wasn’t supposed to be coming on this 4 off as he had plans to watch the Super Bowl with friends at a pub (were in UK) and was seeing his Dad this Friday to celebrate his Dad’s birthday early since he would be at my house for his actual birthday. We’ve been together for over two years and it breaks my heart that he never got to meet my Nan, he gets on well with my family and I know my Nan would have loved him. I’ve asked him if he could come down this weekend on his 4 days off because of the situation and because we aren’t sure how long my Grandad has left. I’d like him to see my Grandad again before the worst happens (if it does), and if he does pass soon as the doctors are predicting, I would want him here for the support. We’ve just had an argument on the phone about it because I feel he’s being selfish and I’d drop everything in an instant if the shoe was on the other foot. He said he’s paid for tickets for the pub showing and wants to see his Dad as he hasn’t seen him since Christmas. I’ve told him I’m not completely sure if I want to continue because of how he has acted in this situation.  
  
I’m not sure if I’m overreacting because of how upset I am currently with my Grandad. AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: My husband and I built our first house - literally - just over a year ago. We participated in a sweat equity program where we spent 30+ hours a week doing manual labor on our house to lower costs. We take great pride in our home and try to keep it clean.  3 months after we moved in, my husband's 22-year-old brother moved in with us to help save on costs while he was going to school. Then, he dropped out of school to work full-time. He makes $14.00 an hour, works about 60 hours a week, and pays us $100.00 a month in rent. 

Today,  I walked into his bedroom and discovered that he spilt yellow paint across the carpet in multiple places, and decided not to tell us. It is now dried and stained. It's not super noticeable,  but you can definitely see it - it's smeared into the carpet in a few places that are at least 6 square inches. His family owns a carpet cleaning company, and he worked for them growing up, so I know he knows that he should have cleaned it up right away AND that it's not coming out now. 

WIBTA for making him pay to recarpet the entire room? Certain family members have told me it's not fair, since I have toddlers who will likely destroy things anyway, and you ""can't really see it much"". I think I am justified that even though it would be pricy, it's his fault and that's part of living with us.

input: I hope this is the right sub for this question, forgive me if it's not. So I have a coworker who recently lost a son and discovered her husband was cheating on her. I feel really bad for her and am trying my best to offer her support since I work with her fairly often (at my job it's two people per shift so we are generally alone together, giving us a lot of time to talk.) I mentioned her situation to one of my roommates because I'm fairly bad at social situations and wanted some advice on how to handle it. For reference, he has never really met her and only seen her a few times when visiting me at work. He proceeded to say that it was her fault for choosing to marry a man that cheats and for having a son with health problems. When I tried to defend her, he kept going with it, saying that she brought the whole situation upon herself. He was obviously joking, considering he makes jokes like this fairly often, but I felt that it was really awful and uncalled for, considering a woman just lost her son and found out the man she had been married to for decades was unfaithful. I called him out on it but he kind of shrugged and went to his room. Lately, I've been kind of cold to him and avoiding mentioning anything remotely serious around him. I want to confront him about it but I am afraid I am in the wrong and just being rude and overdramatic about a joke or just getting too offended on someone else's behalf. He is still a really close friend but I feel like this was a horrible thing to say. AITA for being upset with him even though he was joking?

Now complete the following example-
input: My boyfriend of two years clogged his work bathroom (in the process of using it) and unclogged it with his bare hands. Obviously, I (female) find this appalling.  
It would be funny if this was a one-time, emergency scenario, and it once was, because **this has actually happened before**. He’s told me about doing the exact same thing in college. There was a line of people at a public stall, and he clogged the toilet while he was in there. So while the water’s flowing over and onto the floor, he decides the best course of action…is to stick his arm down the hole and…start digging. I always found this story kind of funny in an over-the-top, shock-humor gross way. But, at the time, it felt like a one-off emergency situation. The fact that the exact same thing just  
happened again blows my mind. It’s not funny now. This directly interfered in our relationship when he told me. I became physically repulsed, and the sex we were planning on having obviously didn’t happen. I was so stunned, I couldn’t even  
express myself properly. I incredulously told him this wasn’t okay and then shut down a bit. He became extremely upset, telling me my reaction was disproportionate and unfair, that I was being cold and shaming him, but I can’t help what disgusts me. At present, the idea of him manually unclogging toilets with his bare hands absolutely fucking disgusts me. The fact that it will likely happen a third time, as I’ve since realized he is a consistent toilet-clogger, disgusts me. I don’t want his hands on me. He tries to spin it like he’s (literally) taking care of shit himself, but it’s clear to me that he just doesn’t want to face the embarrassment of anyone knowing he blew up the bathroom. I think his chosen solution is gross and inappropriate. He agrees, but maintains that my reaction was extreme. Am I the asshole for reacting the way I did?  
Sidenote: this is all because he uses way too much toilet paper. He’s stopped the toilet at my place on more than one occasion. I’ve told him to use less, my mother has told him to use less. Clearly it’s not sinking in. Thank god we keep a plunger handy, otherwise I guess he’d take it upon himself to fingerboard the toilet bowl.  
TL;DR: Boyfriend is a serial porcelain gynecologist, AITA for being revolted?

Now complete the following example-
input: Throwaway post for obvious reasons. 

Just like every other couple, my fiance and I were going through a rough time. It all started with him wanting to talk. He claimed he was not happy and that I am not motivating him in other areas of his life. Initially, I thought  that one of his friends hacked his account as I thought it was just a joke. Afterwards, I got angry and my reaction was not appropriate. After a few weeks, we both realized that instead of dealing with issues in our relationship, we were simply trying to hide them away; we were also taking each other for granted as we were putting our careers and interests instead of each other first. Eventually, I did not blame him for his reaction as I felt we were both guilty of letting something wonderful slide away. 

We tried to talk but nothing seemed to get us to anywhere. During the arguments we both mentioned words and hurtful statements which were not really appropriate. At one point, I have asked him whether he previously had any future plans for us. His response was that he didn't as he was unsure whether I was worth it. 

I felt as if my heart was breaking, I have never had anyone hurt me so much with just a few words let alone someone who I taught loved me. I cried for weeks.

We managed to list down what we really want in our relationship and give it a last shot. I tried to please him in whatever he asked for and his character suddenly changed. We're currently doing amazing. He did apologize more than once for claiming that I wasn't worth it. The thing is that now we are both working on our relationship and I feel as if I shouldn't take him for granted ever again. I also want to make it clear to remind him that he also should never take me for granted again. At times I would ask him a random question and he would answer with a 'No' and I would tease him and ask him 'Why? Is it because I'm not worth it?'. He never actually said anything about it but sometimes seems a bit upset. Yesterday we were having sex and I have put on some sexy lingerie and a high heeled shoes which he really likes. He was in front of me and out of nowhere I asked him again if he still taught I was worth it. He completely agreed. I only occasionally mention it to tease him or to joke about it. To be brutally honest, it makes me feel really good but at times I also couldn't help but feel like I am being an asshole as he did apologize and we are now doing really well.

input: So I can’t fucking stand my little sister, L. We’ve never gotten along and our personalities just do not click. We have a seven year age difference (she just turned 16) so we never really got to like “grow-up” with each other. My mother would ask me to baby sit her all the time and I was told I was in charge, which meant that I was also responsible for making sure L did any chores our mom expected her to do while she was out. The problem was that I would tell her to do them, then she’d act out and either throw a tantrum or physically attack me (she was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder/and schizophrenia at 12) and I would do my best to handle the behavior. Most of the time I’d be able to get her to do her chores, but then as soon as my mom would come home L would immediately go to her and complain that I was mean and bossy and hit her. My mom would yell at me for bullying her despite me telling her EVERY time that L would flip her shit when I asked her to do what she told her to. At one point I gave up and would let L do what she wanted but would remind her of the chores and that mom would be home soon. She wouldn’t do them, mom would come home, see that L’s chores weren’t done, and the proceed to yell at me for not “being responsible” and making sure that L did her chores. This caused a lot of resentment between me and L that has only gotten worse. She’s attacked me physically a few times when she’s had manic episodes (this is when I was in my late teens) and while she was younger and shorter than me she could do serious damage and so I would fight back to defend myself only for my mom to scream that I’m the adult and I can’t touch her. Recently she’s done multiple stints in juvenile detention centers and has been sent to mental rehabilitation facilities (and been kicked out) for her behavior. My mom can’t understand why we hate each other so much and blames me for not trying to mend the relationship and “act like siblings are supposed to.” So I have to ask am I the asshole for hating L and not wanting any sort of relationship with her.

Now complete the following example-
input: Okay, so I have been dating my girlfriend for almost 2 years now and she has always been wonderful to me. However, she is incredibly introverted and the best way to describe the situation is with the words my therapist used: ""/u/DamaruisManeti, you are someone that generally likes people until they give you a reason not to, and even then, redemption is possible. Your girlfriend is someone who generally dislikes people untill they give her a reason to like them.""

She likes to complain fairly frequently about people she doesn't like/things that aren't going well with the people she does like and overall has a fairly negative outlook on people that began to wear on me. Even though her complaints are valid (and most of the time, professional/academic issues), they still seem like she has unrealistic expectations of proven lazy/incompetent people.

One day, she complained about how she doesn't really have good friends (except for me) and that she doesn't understand why her ""friends"" don't prioritize or realize what's going wrong when she talks to them about it. I then broke and told her that her being so negative wears on me and that her having a ""holier than thou"" attitude just because she didn't tell anyone off today is part of the reason that she doesn't have many friends and not really any close ones. She then called me ""naive"" for ""seeing sunshine and fucking rainbows in everyone.""

Things have improved but I think about it a lot and am wondering if I am in fact, the asshole.

Now complete the following example-
input: I have employees who work in people’s homes, or in retail locations. In other words, their schedule is set for them and they report to the location scheduled. They have their schedule a month in advance, and are able to request a change if necessary. 
Each position gets ample training, and retraining. Occasionally, an employee doesn’t produce results, so I call them in to help figure out why. They make more money when they produce results. Otherwise it’s just an hourly wage. The bonus and commission can be fairly lucrative. Hourly alone, well, they could make more working fast food. So the incentive is there. The training is proven effective, and if they follow the training, they can make $20-25 an hour. 
I have an employee who hasn’t been producing results. I’ve brought her in for retraining, asked what’s going on from her perspective (nicely) and she says she’s doing everything the way she was trained. 
I spot checked her today. She was not doing things according to training. I watched her for a while without her knowing. (Retail location, from another aisle) 
When i approached her, I totally caught her off guard. She went beet red, mouth agape. I greeted her, spoke some niceties, then told her what I observed was not being done right. I am her direct manager. The only one above me is the owner. I hired her. It was well within my realm to correct this action. 

Her only response was, “Did you come here just to check on me?”

I was honest. I said I spot check often, and while I did have some shopping to do, I did Intentionally visit this location to check on her. 

She corrected her activity. But she was very unhappy that I checked on her. 

AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: Context: United States. 

&amp;#x200B;

A good friend of mine has asked me to be her character reference to support her enlistment in the army. I have advocated on her behalf during her challenging college search and have always been firmly in her corner even when no one else was. She often feels like she's living in more successful peoples' shadow, including her brother, who just recently enlisted. She has yet to tell me why she's joining, just that she needs a reference. She has never once mentioned the army before this. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I find military recruitment morally reprehensible. I went to HS in an impoverished district and saw a lot of penniless students get swept up into military service just so they could get through college and have the same opportunities as their wealthier counterparts. If someone feels genuinely passionate about serving their country, then I say more power to 'em. I can respect that. But I can't respect the downright predatory and manipulative techniques used to bolster recruitment, particularly the targeting of minorities, the impoverished, and women. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to support my friend in whatever path she chooses in life, but I feel very uneasy about actively supporting her choice to join the army. I don't really want to be an active participant in her enlistment because I don't think she's joining for the right reasons, and I think recruitment played a huge role in her decision. I of course will emotionally support her no matter what.

&amp;#x200B;

So AITA if I refuse to be her reference?

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm 33 and my wife is 29. We've been together for 4 years, married for just over a year. 

We moved to a different country together in July as I got a job transfer. She found a job here and has her work permit, but she is still waiting on her resident's visa. 

This means I'm the only one with a bank account, valid driver's license, etc. Also her salary is pretty low (I'm earning more than double what she earns). All of this means that I'm the only one able to actually financially call any shots with regards to any purchases or payments.

I have my dad and some close family friends here, but she doesn't have any of her blood relations. It's a bit harder I guess for her to feel at home. We spend most of our time with my dad and his friends. 

We've been staying with my dad since we got here, and I haven't really put any effort into getting our own place, even though we can easily afford it. It doesn't make sense to me to get our own place yet since we're staying with him for free. I'll admit though, I haven't made an effort to save any money but we've been enjoying ourselves.

She's an introvert who struggles with anxiety and depression. She wants our own space where she can chill at home in her pjs after work and cook our own meals (difficult to do as we're in my dad's house).

She keeps going on at me for not doing anything to try and regain our independence as married adults. She's been arranging viewings at apartments for us and put together realistic budgets that includes saving a decent amount. 

She's mentioned the idea of leaving me to go back home but I doubt she'll do that.

Am I the asshole for not putting effort into being an independent married couple just yet? Or is she the asshole for trying to rush us and threatening to leave?

Now complete the following example-
input: (I do not believe this violates the violence policy as I am not advocating violence, it just happens to be an important part of the story)

I am getting married in 4 months.  We have been planning for about 2 years and my sister accepted being my maid of honor as soon as I got engaged.  I had more bridesmaids than my fiancee has groomsmen.  About two months ago my fiancee asked my sister's husband to be a groomsman to help even out the sides.  My fiancee has only met him a couple of times and only put him in because we didn't have anyone else at the time.  Our bridal party also includes their three children.

We found out this week he has physically abused my sister.  He threw her to the ground and broke her hand.  I do not live in the same country as her so I do not see their relationship on a daily basis.  She has begrudgingly confirmed this happened but refuses to acknowledge it as a problem.  

My fiancee does not want him standing up there with us.  I do not want him standing up there with us.  My fiancee has since been in contact with an old friend who has come back into town and he would like to include this old friend and replace my sister's husband.  WIBTA if I called my sister's husband and and told him that we have found someone else to be in the wedding party?  And WIBTA if I was truthful about why we were removing him?  We would not be uninviting him from the wedding completely, just the wedding party.

I believe there is a high likelihood my sister would refuse to come to the wedding meaning  the children would also not be there. It would also very likely cause additional drama in the family.

Now complete the following example-
input: 
Backstory: My brother lives with his fiance and their 2 kids, both aged below 5. I'm the godfather to these kids. They live around a 4 hour drive away from me. My brother doesn't live near anyone else in my family who are also around a 4 hour drive away. He does live near quite a lot of his fiance's family. My family live closer to me but none of them drive. My brother is 35, I'm 25. 

What's happened: So my brother and his fiance find it very difficult to get time alone to go out for drinks, time alone etc. His fiance's family refuse to babysit the 2 kids so that they can go out. This has led to him asking me to do it. I've done it 5/6 times in the past. This involves a 4 hour drive each way and all the petrol costs etc, plus all the time i completely lose out of my weekend. He asks me to do it a lot and altough he doesn't always explicitly say it, it's clear he just wants me to come and visit so that i can baby sit and they can go out. He'll sometimes give me a portion of the fuel cost, but i still always end up short changed. 

After like the 8th time of doing this in a just under 2 year period, i really started to get frustrated at it. I feel like it's not fair that i'm even asked to drive 8 hours (there and back), sit alone bored while the kids sleep, pay out of my own pocket for this experience, and lose my whole weekend as a consequence. Out of frustration i simply started telling him i couldn't make it for one reason or another each time he asked. He asked at least twice a month. I've told him i'm not a fan of it. 

So recently, me and my girlfriend planned to go visit Him during a week off me and her had. We would visit on the Sunday. He’d been nagging me to come Saturday and when I said I can’t but we’ll come down Sunday, he says no don’t bother there’s no room to stay. I snapped at him saying I’ve got a life I’m not a baby sitter etc. 

All goes quiet, we don’t go in the end. Until I get a message today saying how I should make more effort to see the boys etc and how I’m
Being a terrible godfather, all that stuff. I kinda snapped at him here.

AITA for snapping at him here? I said that he’s not angry about that, he’s angry because I won’t be on demand baby sitter? 

I want to see the boys but not if it’s on the terms of me being baby sitter every time
At my detriment. Is this bad? I’ve said if
It’s for a day out etc, I’ll always come down.

Now complete the following example-
input: I am pretty reasonable guy and family is extremely important to me. So for me to even consider cutting Mother-in-law out of my life is a pretty big deal.

TLDR; Mother-in-law is unreasonable, self-centered, manipulative, toxic and more… Whenever she opens her mouth, only negative things come out of it. Verbally and mentally abusive to my wife and I am tired of her crap and have cut her out of my life. Currently, wife and baby are still interact with MIL.

A lot more information about Mother-in-law (MIL): she likes to complain about everything, selective hearing, dismissive, extremely defensive when one opinion differs from hers, every thing should be done her way or it’s the wrong way, constant need for attention, demands appreciation for anything she considers helping, will call my wife to complain for hours about irrelevant things. 

Story time:

After a year of marriage, the wife and I decide to try for our first baby.

MIL decides to move to Florida to be closer to us so she can help out with the baby. After a few months, she turns around tells us that she is not happy here, feels abandoned by us and upset that we made her move out here… 

(We never asked her to move out here, wife talks to her everyday for hours and spends a few hours with her on the weekend – unsure where she has been abandoned or forced to move here)

MIL gets a puppy to fill the void of being abandoned by us. Good puppy, poorly trained – poops and pees in the house, jumps on people, etc… 

Eventually, we get pregnant and MIL seems to be trying to help in her way, which is the only right way to do thing. At about 6 or 7 months, MIL has an emergency and needs to speak to wife. She drives out to my wife’s work with her dog (private gated property – no pet policy) and wants to go on a walk to talk. As usual, the emergency is to complain about someone or something and during the walk, the dog gets excited, and tries to jump on a random worker walking past them. Person is clearly not comfortable with a dog trying to jump on them and wife says something along the lines of: ‘probably should not have the dog out here due to work policy and I need to get back to work it’s been over an hour’. MIL gets extremely upset by this and makes the following comments: 

1. Again accuses my wife of abandoning her and only the dog is supportive of her (makes no sense, because wife is clearly taking time out of her work day to make sure she is okay after stating it was an emergency and after finding out it is not an emergency still spent time with her). 

2. Then tells my wife that she is a horrible daughter and will be a horrible mother… 

(This is the point where I decided that I am done with her until she gives an apology – who says that to their pregnant daughter? Seriously)

Wife decides to take a break from talking to her mom and a week later MIL messages wife like nothing happened. No mention of the incident or apology. Eventually she gave a half-ass apology like ‘I am sorry that you were hurt by what I said’ (not an apology).

I am going to fast forward to after the baby is born. We decide to do daycare as we both work during the day. MIL thinks we should hire a nanny so that it is convenient for her. She hires her friend, X, for an insane rate for a nanny with no experience. I’m no expert, but for $20/hr, we could hire someone with experience, cpr certified, baby education experience, the works… MIL agrees to pay for half of the fee and we begrudgingly accept to appease the MIL.

2 months later, MIL has a falling out with X and the shit hits the fan. MIL fires X without consulting us, the parents, on a Wednesday morning. She then calls wife at work and says come pickup the baby, I fired X and I have yoga, doctor’s appointment and some other plans for the afternoon so I can’t take care of the baby. (I am so pissed off when I hear this – it really takes a certain type of person to be this inconsiderate)

I start calling local daycares to find something ASAP and most are full. As a last resort, call a friend who runs a daycare (that was full 2 months back) and they know the situation and gladly make room for her. (Cheers to awesome friends)

MIL calls wife later that night and asks when she would be bring the baby over so she can take care of her. We tell her that we found a daycare and we will be taking her there in the morning. She gets upset that we found a daycare and did not consider her in this decision.  (I wanted to tell her tough shit, baby had plans to go to yoga at daycare in the morning – but wife gave me the death stare). Wife sugar coated the situation and MIL accepted it.

Few other events to note:

MIL called my wife a bitch for not siding with her regarding X.

Then when wife demanded an apology: ‘I’m sorry that you are unempathetic’

MIL has decided to diagnose my wife as having a personality disorder and a hoarding disorder.

This is funny to me because I work in the mental health field and neither of these diagnoses applies.

MIL has decided our house is unsafe because of wife’s hoarding, cat litter box, and the security cameras I installed since having a nanny. Refuses to enter our house and demands we bring the baby to her place if we want help with the baby. 

All of this plus more

I have come to the realization that MIL is toxic and I do not want to be around that. 

AITA for wanting to cut that out of my life? I refuse to interact with her and have left the decision for cutting her out of our life to my wife. Currently, Wife and baby still interact with MIL, but if things keep up – would not surprise me if wife cuts her out too.

input: Hey everyone, I'm a first time poster. Came across this thanks to vids on YouTube. A little backstory. We are 4 people renting and living in a 4 bedroom house. We had a set of rules that were agreed on when we move in together. But the ones discussed here are the "" guests"" rule. We agreed that guests were allowed one but for overnight stays, everyone must agree to it and can only be on weekends unless it's an emergency. ( We are fairly young and all of us have had some experience with shitty people). 
Everything is ok untill one of my roommates started bringing his girlfriend over on the weekends. We didn't mind at first, but she's here from Saturday to Monday and then back again on Wed. 
She always ends up doing her laundry and doing alot of cooking, which I don't mind since is a domestic thing once in a while. But every, fucking, weekend. And then when she's over, the "" volume or loud noise"" rule goes out the window. Which if it's a  weekend, I don't mind but on a Sunday when we all need to be up and out by 5:30, is a bit annoying. It's been 2 years and I feel she should be contributing since she's here 4 days a week. She doesn't really help with cleaning or even just helping take out the trash ( trash days are Mondays). I just feel like the one time in the week I do get to relax, is the time of the week I need to work around another person. It's not fair that she is here every weekend.

Now complete the following example-
input: This is probably not gonna be as intense as most of the other posts on here but his is something that really make me feel very guilty.

I guess it'd be helpful if I talked a bit about my background. I'm from an upper middle class family in India. I (19M) live with my parents in their house. I've never earned any significant amount of money and don't plan to get a job anytime soon. Currently I'm studying Computer Engineering at a good university. Oh and my parents just invested most of their savings to buy a new house and they'd been tellin my that they have financial issues since then. 

So this is where my problem begins, I have never needed extra coaching or tuitions but my dad enrolled me for one and I have to go there. This basically makes its so that 5 days a week I leave my home at 7:30 am and come back after 9 pm with only around 2 hours of breaks (including the time it takes to commute). I did attend the first few lectures sincerely and tried to pay attention to what was being taught, but I literally cannot. And the fact that about 80% our syllabus is something I learned 5 years ago makes it even worse. I talked to my parents about this but they said that this year is the base and I need put in my best efforts...

Last week one of my friends decided to not attend one lecture and asked me if I wanted to bunk with him and his friends and I went with them. I've not attended any lectures since then. Btw I have had a near 100% attendance record for the last few years. My parents pay over 2 Lakh rupees (like $3-4k) just for the fees. I feel really bad that I'm wasting their money but I don't think I can sit through the tuitions. 

I feel extremely bad about lying to my parents and basically wasting their hard earned money, but I really don't think I can keep this up for long, especially since they're being extra nice to me because they think that I'm forcing myself to attend. 

I'm sure I'm gonna get some comments telling me to just attend those lectures and not pay attention. The problem is that 
1. I could very well do that but that'd still make me feel awful and I don't think I can do that
2. I am probably being dumb but sitting through the lectures, and especially C programming (I've been studying it for at least the past 4 years) literally gives me a panic attack. I'm writing this at 1 am in the morning so it'll take some time  for me to reply. 

TL:DR: Don't wanna attend coaching classes for my 1st year Comp Engg program, but parents already payed for it. I haven't gone for over a week.Not attending makes me feel bad, but sitting through one makes me feel extremely sad. AITA? Even if I am being a dick, could someone please help me out here?

Now complete the following example-
input: This is a long one, TL;DR at the end.

So I work at a company that has a pretty lax 'fraternization' policy. As long as it's not a direct supervisor or department manager, associates are free to date and mess around all they want. Well, I hooked up with a coworker from a different department (I'm just gonna call him Jack for simplicity's sake) I didn't know all that well (we maybe said hi to each other a few times a week, had like two in depth conversations) and regretted it immediately. It was bad sex, it happens.

I told my friend from another department about the hookup because she and I always talk about our bad sex experiences or funny hook up stories. It was discussed outside of work over drinks. As far as I am aware, she has not told anyone else about it.

Cut to a week later and I find out from someone in Jack's department that he not only told a group of five of his coworkers about it, he went into great detail about the scars on my stomach from surgery I had in my teens and made fun of my weight (I'm overweight and working on it, but he is also on the bigger side so I found this to be a low blow). According to the coworker, his exact words were, ""I really lowered my standards for her."" 

I was obviously upset by this but decided to let it go because I told someone else at work about the bad sex.

Another week passes and someone from a different department asks if I know Jack. I said yes and she pulled me aside to tell me he had some pretty nasty remarks to say about my personal life. Apparently, because I freely admitted to him that I had numerous partners, he told some more coworkers that I was a whore.

I always admit how many people I've been with because I think that's important to know before sleeping with someone. I get tested regularly, always use a condom, and, again, I freely admit this before any sort of sexual activity takes place.

After this I confronted him in the break room and basically told him to keep my business out of his mouth. He claimed he didn't tell anyone my name and people just happened to guess it was me (nearly 200 people work in our building so I doubt this). I told him to eff off. I definitely could have handled this better.

Now, about a month after the hookup, a friend of mine from high school texts me and asks if I work with Jack. I had recently introduced this friend to a coworker and they've gone on some dates. She and Jack hang out regularly with a group of friends and were talking about our coworker when he asked if she knew me. She said yes and he told her we hooked up.

I'm considering going to HR because of this. WIBTA if I filed a complaint even though I also told someone about the hookup?

TL;DR - hooked up with a coworker, had bad sex. I told a coworker about it and later learned that he has since told at least seven other people (coworkers and people outside of work) that I'm fat, that he lowered his standards for me, and that I'm a whore because I admitted to having numerous partners. WIBTA if I went to HR and reported it?

input: Some background: My girlfriend is really busy. Like, really busy. She barely has a free day during the week, but her Saturdays are completely free usually. I don't really get to see her outside of school.

Well, we'll be together for 2 years on the 23rd. For the past few weeks, i asked her a couple of times if she wanted to meet up the Saturday/Friday before our anniversary, because she's busy on Sunday (our actual anniversary). She kept telling me she'd check, but she never did. 

Last week I asked her to check if we can meet (her parents really need to know that stuff in advance and stuff), and she said that she doesn't know if she should check because her mom's birthday is on the 25th and they might do something for that. 

Yesterday I asked her again because my family asked me if I wanted to go somewhere together on Saturday, so I needed to know if we were meeting up. She seemed to get kind of mad at me and annoyed, and said that she already told me that she probably can't meet.

Am I the asshole for feeling like she doesn't care about our anniversary as much as I do? It might seem pretty dumb, but she means the world to me and I want to know if I did something wrong.

tl;dr I got hurt that my girlfriend doesn't seem to care about our anniversary as much as I do. Wondering if I'm in the wrong here.

Now complete the following example-
input: This hopefully won’t be a lengthy post and I’m begging for your opinion on this.

I dated this guy for around 2 months when this happened. He was on vacation with his family and I really wanted to talk to him. I called him up a few times and he wouldn’t answer. Then finally he picked up but his aunt was the one who answered. She said “We are having an important conversation do not call again.” 

I know I shouldn’t have but I ended up calling soon after. I was furious in the fact that there was no other explanation and that my ex couldn’t just explain that himself. I’ve never even spoken to this women before that call. What followed the call was the aunt telling me how I’m too needy and annoying. My ex then blocked me on everything and only left me with a “We are over” text.

I have spent that last week and a half trying to contact him to get an explanation on what happened. I’ve even sent him a screenshot of me texting my other ex telling him I don’t have a boyfriend. I still got no reaction. I am constantly trying to get a response by using multiple numbers and multiple social media accounts.

AITA here because I still think I’m entitled to some kind of reasoning behind the breakup. Thank you for reading and lmk who you guys think is the asshole it is greatly appreciated :)

input: From the title you all probably made up your minds and I dont really blame you. Its possible youre right. The fight after the fact put me in defense mode so im making this post to see what others think.

Ive been depressed for two months. Eating very little. Not shaving or showering much. I quit my job and have been living off my savings. 

My girlfriend of seven months got pregnant with my daughter, but decided to abort. We broke up. Ive been alone ever since. I dont want to get out of bed, and I spend most of my days watching videos of babies playing and hugging on youtube, crying, watching more videos, crying, eating, sleeping ect.

My family knows but I asked them to keep distance from me. I want to be alone. My mom has been worried about me and begged me to attend her birthday so she could see me. I promised to go but the day of I imagined how much I would like to go to my daughters first birthday and I just collapsed in bed and turned my phone off.

I looked up this picture https://ibb.co/b7jwFTK and just stared at it all day.

My brother in law came banging on my apartment door but i didnt answer. 

Later my sister blew up my phone and called me a POS for not coming despite my promise. I told her to lose my number and that she doesn't know how I feel.

Now complete the following example-
input: Nearly a year ago I had a very short relationship with an ex boyfriend. It lasted maybe 3 or 4 months. We ended up breaking up because I discovered that I am a lesbian. I had a thorough talk with him and assured him that I had no hard feelings and the split was not his fault, it was just my self discovery.

We were able to be friends until the summer, where I found out he had been spreading rumors, making sexual comments, calling me an asshole for breaking up with him, etc. I decided to cut him off and basically ghosted him. I feel bad for ghosting him, but at the time we didn’t talk much anyways and I was very scared of confrontation and arguments.

He still talks to a few of my friends about me to this day. None of it is negative anymore though, just things like he wishes he could be my friend again or that he doesn’t think he’s over me. Because of how long we have been broken up compared to how long we were dating, it makes me uncomfortable that he might not be over me.

He and some of his friends have recently been saying to my friends that I have no reason to not talk to him anymore, and that his rude comments came from “a place of anger” that he is no longer experiencing.

My question is, AITA for not wanting to be friends or for feeling uncomfortable?

Now complete the following example-
input: Several years ago, my wife and I stopped talking to her dad and her step family completely. The can be nice people, but are incredibly toxic. Her step brother is a recurring drug addict, her step sister is in her 30s but has never held a job for more than 6 months, the step mom spends money they dont have like you wouldn't believe. 
Now her father has his own issues, and is obviously the biggest connection point to my wife. But for his entire life he was always irresponsible (except for his job). He simply could never understand finances, and basically just accepted being in massive debt. He had worked on HIS fathers land as a farmer for most of his life, and pushed all the other siblings out of his life in one way or another over the years. Before his dad died, my father in law gave him this long winded speech (we were present since the grandad was on his deathbed) about signing the farm and land over before he died to ensure the other siblings wouldn't sell it off. Sure enough, right after the grandfather died my father in law sold all the land in several sales in the course of three years to pay for all the stupid expensive stuff he bought. Wife and I actually offered to buy some of it, and he said ""I'm not ready to part with it yet"", acting as if he hadn't already sold some. He then said ""okay, I'll give you these 15 acres for $200k"". Way too much for us to afford, then he went and sold it for $100k a month later to a stranger.
Fast forward several similar asshole-ish events and 5 more years, and we simply dont talk to him anymore. Pretty much acting as if he doesnt exist.
Since the holidays are happening, he contacts my wife and essentially asks ""what happened?"".
We havent ever given him a specific reason why we dont talk to him. Quite frankly, there was never one reason why, and I feel like if we were to have an honest conversation with him it would consist of hours and hours of pointing out all the obviously shitty things hes done in his life (to and around us).

Now complete the following example-
input: The first time I ever met this guy, the second he walked through the door he mentioned a quilt I had folded over my couch in the front room was ugly. ""Wow, that's an ugly blanket!"" I wrote it off as maybe he was just socially awkward and was looking for something to say and that's what came out of his mouth cause he was nervous(He was early 20's at the time). The quilt was a gift, made from my deceased Grandmother, who loved to sew/knit/quilt in her spare time. I didn't press the issue and just let it roll off, my roommate mentioned it was something my Grandmother made, and there was no apology; I later mentioned to my roommate that it was pretty rude of him to say after he had left. 

Another instance when he came over he mentioned again about the ugliness of the blanket, I bit my tongue and just rolled my eyes. There were a few more people this time and he brought his hookah pipe. I didn't partake in any cause I don't smoke tobacco, but he went to the kitchen to get it all setup. The kitchen is kind of my space with my roommate situation. I do all the grocery/cooking so I always maintain the kitchen and it's cleanliness. After they had left, there was a huge mess of tobacco all over the counters, on the floors, and some smudge marks on the drawers that I had to clean. I brought this up to my roommate again after the fact, and she just kind of shrugged it off (she's very unconfrontational, so I expected the reaction and he doesn't come around very often).

A few years have gone by, and he's going to be coming over again. It never fails for him to make the rude comment about the blanket, and when he does I'm pretty sure I'm just going to explode and call him a piece of shit. He is not my friend at all, and he's the only friend of my roommate's that I really just can't stand and I've made this known to her whenever he comes up in conversation (rarely). Typically when I reach my tipping point I don't have much of a filter and that's what'll go down if anything is said.

input: My boyfriend (well just call him M) and I are creators on Instagram (he is also on TikTok). I'm a digital and traditional artist and in one of my classes we create t shirts and things (socks, lanyards, water bottles, stickers, you name it).

M wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

Now complete the following example-
input: This will probably be a long one, but here it is:

We have a caregiver living with us since last year. She used to be really nice, then she took a vacation and seems like a totally different person since she came back.

Our agreement was that she would take care of an elder family member and have the weekends off, but she would still live here. We also agreed she would do part of the house chores. I pay her well(i think). She works from 9am\~10amish to about 13h\~14h. Not too many hours. After that I take over, and she spends her afternoons and evenings how she want to(and decided to work somewhere else to get more money, which I didn't oppose to). 

Recently she's been slacking off on house chores, but I didn't really mind. I kinda did but I'm mostly a very forgiving person.

Problem is: she doesn't buy her own stuff. Eats all of mine. Every month I do a nice grocery shopping so that she and my grandma have good food to eat, and I buy a whole lot of stuff.

Yet, she still eats everything that i buy for myself. for example:

Made dinner the other day. Saved leftovers for me to eat on the next day. Woke up to no leftovers at all.

This happened a few times.

Yesterday I ordered pizza and saved a few slices for me and my grandma(and even her, if she wanted to). There were 3 slices. She basically ate all of them, and didn't offered none for my grandma.

&amp;#x200B;

Another stuff that's bothering me are the toiletries. Her room is full of her own stuff, yet she still uses most of mine. Soap, shampoo, even a shaving cream I bought for me, she asked to borrow it and just took it for her.  

Even laundry soap: bought a full pack on sunday. about 1,5kg. 

I was gonna do my laundry yesterday and there was. no. soap. at all. 

And it's not like she did a whole bunch of laundry too. She did hers, only. and the laundry soap just poof'd.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm ok with sharing. I really am.I buy stuff for all of us to use, but i just wonder how can someone use 1,5kg of laundry soap in about 2\~3 days.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, we really don't have that many money. I'm almost going on debt to pay her + pay the house bills and there's barely enough money for me to eat. I've been skipping meals like crazy. My grandma and her confort is my main priority.

&amp;#x200B;

am i being a bitch?

is she being a bitch?

what should i do?

&amp;#x200B;

I really hate conflicts and I like her(she's not a bad person, i think), so I feel kinda bad that it has come to this(me writing a reddit post trying to understand sides).

Wish I could find a way to be more assertive and make her understand my side without flipping out(she tends to freak out when things don't go her way, and can be very rude sometimes).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: caregiver works about 4h a day, 5 days a week. Lives with us, uses most of my stuff, and hides a part of it in her room. don't wanna fire her bc i kinda like her, but i don't wanna be taken advantage of.

Now complete the following example-
input: Sorry for any formatting, I’m on mobile. 

I’m graduating high school this year, and booked a 5 week trip for this summer. It’s with a volunteer company, and I’m at an animal shelter for 4 weeks. I’ve been planning it forever, and it’s been booked (flights and accommodation) for more than three months. Also, I mentioned it on my instagram once in November. 

Fast forward to a few days ago. A girl who is in one of my classes (who also follows me on instagram- important because she most likely saw that I’m going to this city from my instagram) casually mentions she won’t be going to grad because she’s not here. We ask her why, and she proceeds to tell us about how she’s going to the exact city I’m in, with the same volunteer company for the first two weeks I’m going to be there. I’m kind of irked because I was planning on spending this time with nobody I knew from home, but whatever. Then, she tells me she’s also at the animal shelter- there’s 10 “projects” to choose from for this particular city, and she chose the one I talked about on my instagram, for the same weeks I’m there, and in the same city. 

She says she hasn’t booked anything yet, and she could be the type to not actually follow through with what she says- but I still really don’t want to spend 2/ my 5 weeks around her. We aren’t friends, I wouldn’t call her annoying but I wouldn’t spend more than an hour with her. 

WIBTA if I talked to her about switching cities or choosing different weeks? Or at least asked if she’d be willing to switch projects? 
Don’t get me wrong, of course I want her to experience it and all that but I really wanted these couple weeks away from everyone at home.

I said to them that I didn't feel comfortable with it since it did not feel like a place where I would belong. We ended up not going there because of me, and they seemed to be a bit upset with me.

This was two-three years ago, I still am friends with them, just wondering if that was an asshole move?

Now complete the following example-
input:           I dated this girl for about a month and a half and I just broke up with her a couple days ago. Ever since we began dating I could tell that she would “fabricate” stories about her life (ex: she told me and my parents that when she was 19 years old, she trained dolphins at Seaworld). Even my mom caught her on 2 of her lies and brought them up to me later. Anyways, she would lie like this almost on a daily basis, and it would be quite obvious, but I never called her out on it because I didn’t see the need to, although it did bother me that she thought I was stupid enough to get such a blatant lie past. 
          Fast forward to this past week, she went to the doctor to see if she could get an IUD, and found out that she has HPV, which caused her to get cervical cancer. I don’t have HPV (I get STD tested every year, as well as I got my HPV shots) and seeing as HPV is an STD, this made me very uncomfortable about whether or not she’d been cheating on me, or just even what other diseases she might have. She told me that the cervical cancer is most-likely easily treated. However, I wasn’t emotionally invested in the relationship anymore because of all the lying in the past, and this was too much stress for me at the moment, as I’m currently in the middle of a tough semester in school and playing a season of baseball. So I called her and broke up with her because I can’t deal with everything right now and she told me that she “knows why I’m breaking up with her” and “when the going gets tough, I won’t be there” and hung up on me. 

AITA for breaking up with a girl after she developed cervical cancer from an STD?

Now complete the following example-
input: Quick context: I (F19) have known my friend (M19) for over 6 years. He has always been a close friend, and we were even a couple for one and a half year over 4 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

During the four years where I have been single, he's had 3 other girlfriends, all which ended when he got broken up with. Currently, he found a new girlfriend on Tinder that lives 3 hours away (we're quite rural), and he's been dating her for 3 months now.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem is, my friend has been depressed ever since he finished primary school because of bullying and isolation, and therefore is a package of problems. I have no problem with him being depressed, I was one of the people that actually helped him get proper care one year ago once he got to his lowest (almost suicide, told his mom behind his back) which got him what he needed. But I feel he should wait with the dating until he starts feeling better and is more capable of taking care of himself. While his depression doesn't physically manifest anymore (tired, lazy, no motivation), he is still very mentally and emotionally broken. All those girlfriends I mentioned dumped him because he became too needy, and while their lives moved on and had other stuff happening his only things were gaming and the relationship. He started demanding more company, but the problem with his company is that he mostly uses it to get the attention and love he needs and pays romantic attention to you only when he remembers that he's supposed to. I know this very well because I was the first that had to put up with it.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't said anything about it yet, but I have told him while he was single that he should wait in getting a new relationship until he's happy with himself and able to create his own happiness instead of just relying on romance.

input: I love my MIL (and SIL who is also super into horses) to death, but this issue is really starting to bug me and my fiancé. 

We live in an area where a lot of people (mostly women) are OBSESSED with horses and riding horses and owning horses just to say they have horses and just.... horses. 

I have never been interested in that kind of thing. I can recognize that horses are a beautiful, elegant creature but I just have never gotten into it. Neither has my fiancé. He has dated girls who had horses and he just couldn’t deal with it.

We have a 13 month old daughter and my MIL is constantly talking about how she is going to get her crazy about horses and riding them and all of that. We don’t want her to. We want our daughter to be involved in more extra curricular activities like karate and baseball and soccer and the like. 

I understand that it’s a hobby. I understand that it’s loved by a lot of people, and that it isn’t hurting anybody. But what this mostly comes down to is that my MIL expects us to pay for it, and I know that is an expensive hobby because she can barely afford for her daughter to do it. I don’t want to pay for something she is insisting our daughter gets into, especially when our daughter isn’t even old enough to tell us what she wants to do. We don’t have a lot of money, just like MIL, so I would rather put this on the back burner and wait until our daughter is way older to even consider her doing it. When I told MIL this, she said we were being unfair and inconsiderate of our daughter.

AITA for telling my MIL we don’t want our daughter to get into horse riding and for expecting her to pay for it if she wants it so bad?

input: Let's call this guy Caleb (although that's obviously not his real name, since we're both Indians). 

I'll admit up front, I'm jealous of Caleb. Hella jealous. Him and I, we're the difference between book smarts and street smarts. Let's put it this way. I can wax political philosophy and talk about different candidates positions for days. Caleb, on the other hand, doesn't give a fuck. But put us head to head in an actual election, and who'd win? Caleb. I have no charisma. He has all the charisma.

And he's perfect, basically everything I *want to* be. He's a national-level baseball player. He's in the same level classes I am, but gets good grades cramming and cheating while I study- hell, I don't even need to study, I just do it because I have no friends or hobbies. He's friends with the group I desperately want to like me, but don't. He's dating my crush. He's dating my fucking crush. 

And I'll admit, I'm bitter. I'm hella bitter. For all my 'intelligence'- and I've grown up being told I'm a genius, that my IQ is off the charts, etc- everyone writes me off as an arrogant blowhard at best. And our entire lives, it's like we've been set against each other. We're two indian boys, whose friends are best friends, in an area with few indian people. And for all my supposed intelligence, he's winning.

And he's always nice to me. Overly nice. I can never figure out if he's actually just friendly, or if he's mocking me. Because I know he sees me as a dork with no friends, for good reason. I've heard people talk about how nice a guy is, but I've also heard people talk about how bad a guy he is. I just don't know. Case in point, today. Me and my family is driving, and we just enter our neighborhood. I see Calen across on the sidewalk, hanging out with some friends and he waves to me. My dad turns around to go meet him. Caleb makes small talk with my dad, and then he says hi to me. I manage out a polite hi. My dad pulls away, and I hear Caleb say to his friends, 'he's really introverted'.  I lean out the window and shout 'I'm not introverted, I just really don't like you! By the way, I'm surprised you know the word introverted!' This was a really spur of the moment thing. But when I get home, my dad yells at me and says Caleb was just being nice. I'm not sure if he really was. Aita?

input: Everyone around me, Democratics and Republicans alike keep harping on about how important voting is, especially in this political climate. I told one person that I didn't plan on voting because I felt like neither side reflects my values, and that choosing the lesser of two evils was still choosing evils. That didn't go over well. The person just went on about how their side couldn't possibly be evil compared to what the other side was doing and that not only should I vote, but I need to vote the same way they do. I just agreed in order to shut them up.

input: Honestly, it should be more 'How much of an asshole' but still. Anyway, my nanna has planned for in July, 14 or so members of our family to go to Canada for two weeks. Which on one hand, does sound kinda nice, but I do have a few reasons for \*really\* not wanting to go.

\-My dad is a prick who I really hate seeing and being around. (See: [This post,)](https://www.reddit.com/r/myfriendwantstoknow/comments/5xzryt/mfwtk_if_their_dad_is_abusive/)  
\-The idea of being stuck with family and no-one else for 2 weeks worries me. There's drama when family members come over for one goddamn day, let alone two weeks left alone with each other.   
\-I'm kinda... worried about a friend and stuff. We chat everyday, and he's an internet friend, but he isn't exactly in the greatest place. I know its stupid, but I'm scared something might happen and I won't know. 

\- I'm trans and whatever. I really want to just... kinda hurry up and get around to changing my name, all that stuf, and moving out. If I'm lucky, I might be able to start that sorta thing by March. But then going on this trip will obiviously fuck that up, and if my family finds out, i dunno./  
\-And the stupidest reason. I'll miss my friends and my dog. idk. I know its only two weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

But yeah. What do you guys think? In all honesty, I'm probably just gonna end up going anyway, and probably enjoying it if just a little. But its been on my mind a lot lately and I want some other opinions. Thank you.

input: so, hi. on mobile, second time poster, english is my first language. 

i moved states (nevada to arizona) in about july. school started around august, but i started in september. so there i was, starting school late in a new state without friends. 

i made my first two friends who aren’t relevant to this story. they introduce me to a, my current girlfriend. 

a asks me out on october 2. yes i still remember. i had just recently come to terms with my sexuality and put a label on it. i say yes and things are smooth. 

around november, a few days before my birthday, she asks me to leave her alone for some reason. trying to be the best girlfriend i could, i did. she didn’t talk to me again until late january/early february. 

by that point i had assumed we broke up without explicitly saying it. i took it hard for the first few days, because a was my first everything. first girlfriend, first kiss, the works. i didn’t realize it at that time but she was my first love too. 

i got over it surprisingly fast. i assumed i did something wrong and gave up. 

pause. 

she starts talking to me again around where i mentioned earlier. so things are chill. there’s nothing romantic between us anymore. however, things developed. she’s my girlfriend now and she has been since a few days ago. 

now, here’s where the title comes into play. i went to her house yesterday and noticed something today: for some reason, she hesitates to be affectionate. i like to think of myself as a very affectionate person and i like being physically close to people. 

so, to make things clear, there’s no lack of affection between us. there’s a lack of reciprocation. 

she can also be very closed off at times and has what i can only describe as mood swings. 

there’s also this other thing she does. she hits people a lot, in a playful way. normally i don’t mind people like that. but as i said, i was at her house yesterday and i came home today. there are two scratches on my face and one on my hand from her. 

she takes it out on me a lot and i think that’s what is causing my doubts. 

so, aita? should i talk to her about it or just let my insecurity get the best of me?

Now complete the following example-
input: I will preface this by saying I am upset and on mobile so I am sorry for the grammar/formatting issues.

So let's start at the beginning, when I (24f) was younger (around 7 or 8 I believe) my mother married my stepdad and I went from an only child to having 2 older (step)brothers. One of them is 4 years older than me, the other is 8. Soon after we got all moved in and settled the eldest's, we will call him Bob's, attitude towards me changed, he went from a protective, fun, new big brother to very short tempered and downright mean. Soon the ""mean-ness"" got worse and eventually became physical....in every sense of the word. Long story short mom and I eventually left and things got much better.
  Fast forward to last year. My mom had since  remarried and was trying to leave her current asshole of a husband, so I moved her in with me and helped her get an apartment of her own. She was very down and depressed and reconnected with her previous husband. (note: I had no issues with my step dad at all, only his children ) They hang out sometimes and talk and all is good on that front....now we get to the messy current situation.
  So I live in the Midwest US and it's still pretty dang cold out. Well earlier today while talking to my mom she mentioned how Bob and his wife were asking about homeless shelters in our area because he had already gotten frostbite last week and wanted somewhere warm to stay.(I feel I should add they are homeless by their own stupid meth fueled choices) Well I gave her the info I knew about local places to get some help, she thanked me, and that seemed to be the end of the conversation. Then I get a phone call about a hour ago from my mom asking for some advice, she wants to let them stay with her for a night or two, or get this, SHE WANTS THEM TO STAY IN MY APARTMENT!!!!! My mom, myself, and my boyfriend all have apartments on the same floor of the same building so I spend a lot of time across the hall at my boyfriend's apartment.
  I flat out said no, no way, hell no, nein, non, NO. I told her if they show up I will call the police and have them removed from property. Now she is acting like I am some kind of heartless garbage person because I won't open my home to a person who not only physically,mentally, and sexually abused me as a child, but who has been arrested and convicted of drug charges multiple time and freely admits to using. 
  So am I really being the asshole here for not wanting them anywhere near me or my family?

Now complete the following example-
input: I am 19 and the girl in question is 21. We have known each other since I was 8 years old, and she used to be my best friend. 

I know she hasn’t had the best life and I am sympathetic on that part. Her parents were dead beat drug addicts, however her and her two sisters were adopted by their grandparents pretty early on. Their grandparents were strict, but also had some good sides from what I’ve seen. And I’ve seen both good and bad. 

There was a time when she lived with my family, around my freshman year. This was after she had run away from her grandparents and gone to live with her mom three hours away. But, she got on drugs and was trying to get out of that situation. Ok. Only problem is that she used my parents hospitality and didn’t actually try to change herself. During this time she was still doing drugs and was having unprotected sex with lots of dudes because she wanted to get pregnant. She went through like 4-5 “boyfriends” within the 2 months living with us. 

Eventually I guess she was tired of my parents trying to give her a normal life cause she moved back with her mom. She then started doing heroine and cocaine. Has been arrested multiple times. She then got pregnant with a dude she had only been dating a few months, though by the time the baby was born she had moved on to a different dude. 

According to her sister who also lives in that town, she has repeatedly left her toddler at home alone in a room while her and her boyfriends go places. She didn’t take her kid to the doctor when he got bad diaper rash or got sick. She also got pregnant again and so now she has two kids.

I haven’t talked to her since she left and my mom has been guilting me the whole time. This girl has tried to send me pics of her babies or reach out to me, but I always block her. It’s not that I hate her or are mad, it’s just that I have no sympathy anymore and I don’t want to see someone ruin their life.

Now my mom just got a letter from her. She’s in prison for violating her parole. For drugs. But apparently she tried to kill herself and turned herself in. Maybe she is actually trying to get help and it’s a step in the right direction, but I still have no desire to speak to her. My mom says she mentions me every time they talk. 

AITA for not caring?

Sleep on me while I spend the night I've started to wake up with my eyes itchy and puffy. Her mother has actually considered this a problem in our relationship because I don't care for her cats. I've tried recently but I don't really to touch them. I find them disgusting honestly. My girlfriend keeps bringing it up so I believe it is honestly becoming a problem.  

Recently she has started to come over less because her cats throw a fit whenever she spends the night at my place. I can't bring her cats because my parents will have a severe allergic reaction. I also feel like that she loves her cats more than shell ever love me. I've started to come over to her less because of her cats.

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm writing this on a throwaway bc I'm pretty sure my main account is pretty easy to trace back to me, which I'd rather not happen. Also I'm on mobile so apologies for any formatting mistakes. TLDR at the end. 

I'm one of seven kids, and my mum walked out on the family shortly after my youngest sister was  born 18 years ago. Mum was very young herself at this point, only in her mid 20s and her reasoning for walking out was that being a mother was holding her back from achieving her full potential - by which she apparently meant kids were an inconvenience to her desired party lifestyle of heavy drinking and drug use almost daily. During my childhood she constantly flipped between relatively regular visits and contact with us to us not hearing a word from her for weeks or even months on end. My dad is far too nice for his own good and never made any attempt to block us from seeing her, even encouraging us to give her a chance every time she pretended she wanted to get sober because ""she's your mother guys, at least let her try."" 

Thing is, even when she was present, she was a terrible mother. She was constantly either drunk or high when ""caring"" for us and was incredibly manipulative and emotionally abusive. She was also occasionally physically abusive and regularly dated men who were incredibly violent, both towards her and towards us. One guy even put one of my brothers in the hospital - and mum went on to marry him not even a year later. 

The thing that really broke any semblance of a bond for me was what happened when I was a young teen. Between the ages of 11-13, my brother and I pretty much lived at her place about 80% of the time - back then she insisted it was because she just wanted us there but looking back it was more likely so she could claim child benefit. At this time she was in a houseshare with some family friends who were a married couple. Over the course of my time living there, this couple pretty horrendously sexually abused me. This would happen every night that mum was not at the house (read: Almost every single night). When I finally got the courage to tell about it, my mother sided with my abusers, her reasoning being that a) she knew them very well and *she* didn't think they'd do that, b) my brother wasn't abused by them and she couldn't see why they would only do it to me and not also him and c) they said they didn't and they'd never lied to her before and I had - by which she meant there were a couple occasions in the past I had said that I felt unwell to get the day off school when I really felt fine. She even went so far as to defend this couple in court. 

Unsurprisingly this whole ordeal really screwed me up and my teenage years were a mess of alcoholism, crimes and heroin addiction. I cleaned myself up around 20-21 because I couldn't go on hurting my dad and grandparents the way I was. I'm now 25, have been fully sober for almost four years and haven't spoken to my mother in six. I'm happy now, in a very healthy long term relationship with the man of my dreams and on the right path to having my dream job.

 However, at the start of December my mum started trying to get involved with my siblings and I again. I informed her through my sister that I had no intention of ever having anything to do with her again and, aside from a few failed attempts to reach me through my boyfriend, she seemed to accept it at first. All three of my sisters and one of my brothers seemed willing to forgive her and forget what she did right away. Of my two other brothers, one was cautiously optimistic and treading lightly in approaching a potential new relationship with her. The other was the one who was hospitalised by her husband and was on the same page as me with staunchly refusing to have anything to do with her. 

However, around three weeks ago, my mother revealed she has lung cancer and has been informed that she's unlikely to see the end of this year. She said she wants to rebuild a relationship with all of her children while she still has the time and even the brother who was on my side seems to be giving her a chance. She has repeatedly acknowledged that she ""wasn't the best mother"", however she refuses to actually apologise and won't acknowledge that she was in the wrong for siding with my abusers. She still insists that I ""blew it all out of proportion"", though she admits she no longer thinks I made it up completely. To be honest, even if she did apologise - while I would definitely be grateful and would accept the apology - I don't think I could ever forgive her for turning her back on me like that, and I have no interest in having any kind of relationship with her or attending her funeral when she does pass away. 

My siblings and some other family members are starting to get fed up with my refusal to have anything to do with my mum and are insisting I'm in the wrong for denying a dying woman her last wish. AITA for not wanting to repair something that's beyond broken? 

*TLDR: my mother - who was emotionally abusive throughout my childhood and sided with a couple who raped me on multiple occasions - has lung cancer with a very short prognosis and wants to repair her relationship with me and my siblings. I have no interest in doing so and am being made to feel like the bad guy for it.*

Now complete the following example-
input: I was in line at the supermarket earlier today. The lady in front of me, who was maybe in her 50s, had a baby in the front of her shopping cart. The lady had coupons for some of her groceries, but the items she actually had on the belt weren't the same ones listed on the coupons. (In other words, she had the right *brand* of dish soap and ice cream, but the specific *products* the coupons applied to were slightly different from the ones she was actually buying. Thus, she wasn't eligible for the discount. I hope that made sense.)

Now, this lady didn't yell and scream at the cashier or anything, but she made the poor woman explain why she couldn't use the coupon over and over again. For several minutes. I cannot see any possible way this lady didn't understand the cashier's explanation, and I really think she was just trying to frustrate the cashier to the point where she would just give up and run the coupon anyway. (By the way, the store was crowded enough that I didn't think it practical to move to another line.) Finally, she asked the cashier to get a manager, and the cashier paged him. 

Around this time, the baby started making little babbling noises, and the lady turned to me and said, with all smiles, ""Isn't she cute?"". Pissed off, I just replied, ""No."" The lady's face fell like a dead fly, and the cashier looked stunned. We all just stood there in tense silence for a few minutes until the manager showed up (and gave her the damn discount, SMH). The cashier was a little cold and just kind of gave me a *look* while ringing me up. She might have just been put out by the whole incident, but I kind of got the feeling she specifically disapproved of *me*.

So, AITA for telling cheap coupon lady that her baby wasn't cute?

Now complete the following example-
input: About a month ago my wife asked me if I'm ever willing to try an open relationship. We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. 

She immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. 

I told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. 

Tldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.

Now complete the following example-
input: Here's the story of my current situation. I work at a coffee shop and our manager recently left. While we are manager-less I have been put in charge. I do all daily operations, orders, maintenance, settling employee issues, etc etc. I do all of this without any additional pay or title change (they're ""working on"" promoting me but that's a post for a different sub on a different day).  The only things I don't have access to are payroll and schedule building so they're being taken care of by a manager from a near by location. Everybody knows those two things are out of my control and if they need to change their availability or ask for days off they need to talk to that manager, not me. She requires these requests to be put in 2 weeks in advance.

Everybody knows the shitty situation I'm in right now. I'm running a store with no control over my staff's schedules. After schedules get published people often come to me with issues (""I was scheduled on a day and time I have school"" and ""this was already approved time off and yet somehow I'm working???"") They have to put in requests 2 weeks in advance. Everything is just one huge cluster fuck. In instances like this I decide to fuck it and not deal with my ""babysitter."" I find some way to rearrange the shifts and everything works out fine. I've talked to them so many times about how they need to be patient and understanding. I said that I know things suck right now but it's temporary and we'll all get through together. Things will go back to normal after the holidays. In the meantime I'm doing what I can to keep things as normal as possible. You'd think everyone would understand how difficult this all is and they'd be a little mature. I'd hope they could make small sacrifices like just dealing with the fact that their shifts are going to look a little different than we're used to (ex 9AM - 5PM instead of 8AM - 4PM).

There's one barista in our shop that is more bitter than the coffee we serve. She gets off on being pissed off. Anyways... right before my boss left, this barista demanded she be cut to working 4 days a week. Not for school or another job. No. She wants to work 4 days a week because ""it's not fair that I work 5 days a week and bring home 22 hours while Eric works 4 days a week and has the same number of hours!""

She also insists on being out by 3pm every day. ""I need time to see my girlfriend! Never get to see her because our work schedules clash and then I keep getting scheduled all weekend when she's off!"" There are only 3 shifts that get out by 3pm and they're all shorter shifts. The only two 8 hour shifts at our store are 8-4 and a closing shift that gets out around 11:30 at night.  She refuses to work these shifts, again, so she can ""spend time with her girlfriend.""

So next week's schedule came out yesterday and this salty barista saw that she's working 4 days but only has 18 hours. She started complaining left and right. I tried to ignore it because I didn't have time to deal with her hissy baby fit. It's month end, I have a mountain of work, corporate is on my ass despite not giving me access/resources to do my job, and she literally brought this on herself. Besides, I don't build the schedule. She knows this. I can fix small issues but this is not something I had any say in.

At the end of her shift she comes to me telling me she's taking another baristas shift (for a total of 5 days and 23 hours). He works 2 jobs so he doesn't ""need as many shifts here"" and is willing to give her one to help boost her hours. Well denied the request. If he really wants the day off, somebody else can take the shift. But he doesn't want to because she approached him about giving it to her. I am sick of her not being a team player, being negative, and wanting her way or the highway. She cut down her availability drastically and still expects to rake in 22-25 hours a week. Even if I had control over the schedules, I can't pull hours out of my ass like that. 

I told her that I won't allow it because of the availability she insisted on. If she wants more hours she can return to having open availability and pick up some mid day or closing shifts. But I will not give her more morning shifts when she insists on working this way. We have plenty of other people (positive team players) that also need to work morning shifts. 

If I keep accommodating her she'll keep walking all over me and taking advantage of the situation we're in. And it won't stop when I become the manager either. She'll keep doing shady things to get exactly what she wants. This is my line in the sand as a new leader. Am I the asshole for that?

input: Yesterday our 3 year old went on a little adventure. My husband came home from doing some errands, we chatted for a bit in our kitchen, leaving our son to play on his own like we always do in an adjacent-but-not-in-eyesight room. He usually watches TV for a bit after his snack, it's been the routine for a year now. Color us surprised when he managed to unlock the front wooden door, open it, unlock the front glass door, and open it, get down our porch all without us noticing. We noticed after about 10min and we freaked out. 911 and 3hr later, he's brought home from a few blocks away: full of mud but otherwise O.K.

I'm not asking if we were the assholes for not paying attention, because I know we full well were. I do want to ask about our neighbor though and if me blowing up at her was justifiably assholish. After we had our baby back, she piped in to the police officers with us in earshot ""oh I saw him running across the street, I thought he was playing so didn't do anything"". She detailed she knew our kid got out unattended (and did nothing), what direction he went in (and told no one), and previously said she had no idea about anything (lying to cops and us).

I don't get along with my neighbor. She somehow has four cars to their household and frequently parks in our driveway. We don't have a car ourselves. It's been a constant battle over the last five years to get her to stop. She's retaliated, too, but I think this time goes too far. I exploded at her and would have got physical were the police not there.

While I know we should have been more attentive, what my neighbor did was outright malicious. AITA for exploding at her? Is she TA?

input: (Obligatory mobile format apology)

So I was at the gym on the elliptical with an empty one between myself and the person to my left. 20 minutes in this guy walks into the gym and heads straight to the elliptical in middle of us. He was carrying a backpack and looked slovenly, but who am I to judge? We go to the gym to get in shape, not impress others.

Until...

The smell hit me! This is a smell equivalent to someone not showering for weeks. Sort of that heavy musky scent that sits in your nostrils and clogs your brain from thinking.

I immediately got off and 30 seconds later the stranger to the stinksters left got off also. This could have been a coincidence, but definitely felt like he couldn't work out with the smell either.

Now I just went to different machines a little disappointed in not getting to finish my cardio but I didn't want to say anything because god knows I don't smell great after sweating, but, this was prior to him starting, and it was (possibly) room clearing.

Here is the questions:

Now complete the following example-
input: So, I have two of my friends who are in a relationship currently living with me in a studio apartment. They have the living room, and I have my “bedroom” with no door. We’ll call them Mike and Anna.

Living arrangements are definitely subject to change in a few months once we’ve saved up enough to move to a 2-bedroom. The reason we’re all squished in here is because the two of them needed a place to stay to get away from Mike’s narcissistic parents who essentially were trying to ruin Anna’s life over her “taking him” from them.

Among the other issues that can arise from three people living in a studio, Mike and Anna obviously have sex. Most of the time, they’re not bad about it and either do it when I’m not home or at night when they have a video playing or something to muffle the noise. 

They aren’t loud and obnoxious about it. Usually. The problems arise when they don’t have anything playing to muffle the sounds and I hear....well, everything. And I can’t make myself to go sleep until they stop. Even if I can’t hear it, just hearing it start and knowing it’s going on is enough to keep me on edge even with headphones. Usually it isn’t for long.

Last night though, I got about four hours of sleep just because they started at around 12:30am and kept at it till about 2:30-3am. And it was a good bit louder than it usually is. Ended up blasting videos from my phone at full volume because I left my headphones at work and was also annoyed that it kept going for so long. And very tired. I realize it was petty, but ugh.

Haven’t mentioned it to them as of this morning. Don’t know if I need to. Still irritated about losing sleep over it. I can’t exactly tell them don’t have sex. But I dunno, it’s always skeeved me out when people bang near where I can hear all the little noises and such. 

Would I be an asshole for asking for...some kind of compromise, I don’t know what, with having sex? Until we get separate rooms in a new place, that is. I don’t want to make them feel unsafe or that they need to walk on eggshells around me. Do I just keep quiet about it and try to find a pair of earplugs that render me temporarily deaf for when I go to bed?

Now complete the following example-
input: Been debating whether to post this considering it isn't recent, but this has been a constant at the back of my mind now for well over a year and its been happening for some time. Be warned this is long as I need to give some background..

My sister and I never got along when we were kids, it look her moving out and going to Uni on the other side of the country for us to even begin to get along. Our parents divorced, she came home for a little bit and things were okay. 

Then she met her future husband and I noticed she was starting to change, and not for the better so we stopped talking. About 2 years after they were married he was in an accident and he was medically discharged from the Army. At the end of the day he is alright, and I noticed my sister started to act herself again and we started to talk once more. 

Fast forward a few years and once more I notice she changing again. This comes after she and I put some money together to fly mum over to visit her grandkids. Mum then starts to call me several times in the day, in tears because of the way my sister is treating her and how she and her husband are treating the kids. Mum explained at the time as, the husband was acting the drill sergeant and the kids were the soldiers, and my sister agreed with everything he did (another version of her husband).  The more she told me the more I realised my sister is becoming a stranger. 

Next time I see her, its at our cousins wedding. First day she is at the house and she threatens to hit my dog for ""being undisciplined"", now I had just come home from work; I was tired, I didn't want to see her and mum had been texting me asking me to come home early. To say the least I replied ""you touch a hair on my dog and you know where the front door is"", bare in mind I never talk back, I hate confrontation. But threaten my dog and that filter is gone. To say the least she didn't appreciate it.

Now comes the wedding day. We are getting along, drinking together, sharing jokes, talking, taking selfies. Then my mum, aunt and I say we are ready to go, and she goes off and starts talk to another cousin (she isn't our cousin, she's mentally disabled but it makes it easier for her to think of us that way) who she has made very clear she doesn't like. Then things go downhill; mum realises the keys are missing. Now I didn't bring my keys like I normally do so we didn't have a spare. So here we are scouring the car park looking for said keys and my sister is stomping around , pissed and acting the victim. Its not her keys that are missing, she was the one that avoided leaving in the first place. She isn't the one who had to break a window and crawl inside in a $80 dress, calm the dog down, find the spare keys then go back to the reception.

I asked my uncle and aunt that night ""Do you believe me now how much she has changed?"" No one believe me in til that night.

Fast forward several years to the ""incident"" of December 2017. My phone is flashing at me while I'm at work, I have a Facebook alert ""\*\*\* has accepted your friend request""... huh? I didn't send a friend request. Mum has access to my Facebook  account as she sends herself lives for a game she plays that I don't, the only thing I can think of is that she thought she was on her profile and sent it thinking she unfriended her (oh and during this time mum has also had a minor stroke so memory issues). Mum says she didn't. Okay whatever, I'll think on it. I unfriended my sister that night. Why? Because we hadn't spoken in years, I always text her on birthdays, Christmas and New Years with nothing in return and I also didn't like the person she had become.

It was for my own piece of mind. It is now the next day and mum sends me a screenshot of a message my sister sent; ""\*\*\* is a little manipulative bitch. She friends me on Facebook to see what I've been up to and then unfriends me after she's satisfied. If she fucken wanted to know she should of asked"" something to that effect, I don't really want to go and find the message. If she just sent that to mum, yeah fine whatever. Mum chose not to respond as she didn't want to take sides, which is understandable. Only my sister decides to post it on her Facebook page, and its just a rockslide from there.

She accuses mum for taking sides, continues to call me a bitch and manipulative, no matter what mum says she twists and turns it to her own agenda. I knew what she was like and I didn't want that toxicity in my life. I refuse to text her to set things right, I feel like she over reacted over a Facebook invite. Last year at Christmas, mum notices her house is up for sale and approaches her about it. Shit hits the fan once again, she's bringing up that incident once again, continues to accuse us both, in til mum has had enough and has now cut her out of her life. She will not see her grandkids again, my sister will make sure of that.

AITA for not responding to set things right back in 2017? If I had done maybe last year would've not happened and my mum would still be able to speak to her grandkids. I feel like I mishandled the situation and I feel like I'm to blame, that I'm the asshole.

Its ironic, its the worst memories you remember and the ones you want to forget the most.

Now complete the following example-
input: Ok so I’m in Nigeria right now to visit family and we have this tradition of going out to watch what we call “the masquerade” . It includes people who dress up in suits to entertain people (I won’t explain it too much because it’s not important to the story). 

So if you go to watch them it’ll be very crowded which will result in a lot of contact with other people. My friend and I went and we were standing in the middle of a big group when I felt someone holding onto my shoulders. At first I assumed it was a little kid who was scared of the masquerade but when I turned around it was a grown man. 

I saw some girls laughing and joking with him so I just thought maybe they dared him to hold onto me or something. After some time he kept coming back and holding onto me and saying things like “do you want to be my friend?” At first I just tried to just brush his hands off of me because I didn’t want to cause a scene. He still wouldn’t leave me alone so my friend and I moved to the far side of the crowd to get away from him. 

He ended up following us and he put his hands on my shoulders and then on my waist, this got me really spooked because I’m 15 and he was at least in his 20s. I yelled at him to stop touching me and my friend started to berate him and told him to fuck off basically and that he was disgusting, causing him the run to the other side of the road.

The same girls who were laughing at the start came up to us and started arguing with us saying that he was “not right in the head” and he wasn’t aware of what he was doing. I don’t know if he was their brother or their cousin or someone who lives in their area but they were really mad at us. I didn’t know that he was disabled before I yelled at him because it didn’t affect him physically. Everyone in the crowd started to give us the stink eye so we just left. It’s been like 2 or 3 days and I’m still thinking that i could have handled the situation better :/.

Now complete the following example-
input: Disclaimer: I haven't used the internet to fact check them in over a year as it's not worth the argument.

I don't think my SO or his friend are dumb, just definitely misinformed on many things. They both confronted me lately about how I'm basically an insufferable ""know it all"" and they feel humiliated by my fact checking. I'll admit I have PREVIOUSLY been pretty bad about it, especially over   year ago. I like to know the truth about things and am full of pretty useless information, as I think most people who grew up with the internet are. 99% of the time I was/am right, and the other 1% I take as a learning experience and apologize for questioning them. But, when I call them out on something that isn't true they feel like I am questioning their intelligence and get highly offended. I stopped whipping out my phone to show them why they are wrong and usually just tell them what I already know.
The last argument was on if blood is blue when it's still in your body (it's not). A lot of our arguments are over dumb stuff like this. I'm not trying to belittle them, I'm just trying to educate them so they don't look silly when these topics come up around other people, as they both seem insecure about their intelligence.
When I haven't ""checked"" them in the past they will go on to tell misinformation to others and get corrected, to which they will ask me ""Did you know that? Why didn't you tell me that?"" It seems like either way I'm an asshole to them. I'm either a know it all, or I want to watch them burn. 

AITA???

Now complete the following example-
input:  My roommate and I as people were not compatible, we had very different standards, morals, interests, and political views, this caused us to argue incessantly. We both felt very uncomfortable in our own rooms. He threw trash and his clothes on the floor and was very messy in general, when I asked him to clean up he would clean up a little bit but then the next day it would be messy again. He was very loud and he blasted music at night and in the morning, even while I was trying to do my work, my roommate would blast music and when I asked him to put headphones on he said that he didn't want to use headphones because the music wouldn't sound as good. He masturbated at night while I was trying to sleep, and because we were in a bunk bed he shook the bed and kept me up and uncomfortable. His argument usually consisted of how I should have expected a situation like this because we were young and because it was a boarding school. We had many more issues and many more politically heated arguments but I am not one to cause trouble or to snitch. 

It wasn't until later when things began to escalate, I am a person of color and my native language is not English, in an argument when I began to stutter he said that ""I needed to learn how to speak English"". At first, I did not think that the comment was meant to insult my ability to speak English based on where I was from, but later in another argument where I complained about our school, he stated that ""Maybe I should go back home"", I began to feel somewhat uncomfortable. It wasn't until he said that ""Americans are smarter than (my countries people)"" that I got really mad.

We clearly were not getting along and I wanted something to change, while I do not believe that he was a racist person, what he said was certainly insulting. I never discussed these issues with other students because I did not want to make people think he was a racist and ruin his year but he would often misrepresent the situation to other students. I did, however, tell my counselor EVERYTHING that we were having trouble with (except the masturbation part) so I could change roommates. While I did tell my counselor that I did not think he was a racist, the comments he made that I provided as examples certainly made him look that way. This issue reached the higher-ups and eventually all the faculty. 

I did not move rooms because it was an ""impossibility"" but my roommate began to complain to other students that he felt that he was being treated differently and that he had been scolded multiple times by teachers for his behavior against me. I didn't end up bettering my situation and I worsened his, AITA?

My Ex messages me yesterday telling me that she's throwing a birthday party at our apartment without my permission and she also wants me to leave the apartment or stay in my room for the entirety of the party. She's inviting most of my friends to the party as well. I feel as if she's done nothing to garner any kind of favor like that from me. She's been nothing but a terrible person to me.

input: So from the title I do sound like the asshole but let me explain

So my grandma (who I live with) has this friend who we will just call Steph and she has a grandson named 
John. Since Steph owns a plumbing company we called her to ask for repairs (we paid for it in case anyone thinks we we EP’s / EK) and she said sure.

So when she came this morning I was getting my stuff ready to study for an important test worth 30% of my grade in English. I said hi and turned to my desk but then I heard John say hi. I wasn’t expecting him to come and I don’t think my grandma was either. I greeted him and went back to studying and he went to the living room. 

After about ten minutes my grandma tells John go in to my room and a told her I’m studying and I’d rather have no interruptions (keep in mind I had planned all my weekend plans around these 5 hours studying and me and John had never had anything in common as he is still In year six and I’m in year 8) so my grandma tells me to just study later even though I had made plans with my friends for about the time they were going to leave so I say no I’d rather get a decent grade and I thought that was the end of it. After they left and I got back from my plans I was told by my aunt (who was also there) that I’m a horrible friend although I never made plans with John, we don’t go to the same school and never have since he lives 20 miles away and we have next to nothing in common.

So AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: So, for background information, me and my friend are both Juniors in highschool(17 y/o). We live in an upper middle class area in the US and most of the kids around here get there parents old cars or get brand new ones however, my friend and i both bought our cars with our own money. Mine is a way crappier model (2006 Chevy Cobalt) than his but has 80k miles less miles and while i like that my car gets me where i need to be he is obsessed with his Infinity. This led to me pranking his car occasionally, leaving boxes on it and stuff, just as a little prank. Well that all led up to today...

Friend-F Helper-H

So yesterday H and I decided that since it is our last day before spring break we were gonna do something hilarious to F's car, we were gonna sticky note half of it. After about an hour or so H and I finished and we thought it looked great and it was an amazing prank, there would be no damage to his car and if the sticky notes left any residue I left a message on one of them that we'd give him 15 bucks for a car wash. F woild get out of school 4 hours later than H and I so we left and waited anxiously to get his reaction over text.

When F saw his car I got a very different reaction than expected, F wasnt upset at all. All F texted was ""Very Funny."" While suprised, I just thought maybe F actually thought it was funny and moved along. I was wrong.

The next day i go out and find my car with duct tape all over it, courtesy of F. I brought my parents outside to look at it and they were appalled. As we removed the tape my paint job was ruined, there were missing spots everywhere and it was overall ruined. I texted F that he went way over the line and F responded that i had it coming and that it wasnt as bad as what H and I did. I sent him pictures of the ruined paint job and he said i shouldnt have messed with his car in the first place. I proceeded to call him and argued (not going to lie i was yelling at this point) that he needed to pay for a new paint job and after about a minute of listening he cut me off. F proceeded to say that no matter what i did i never thought i was wrong and was a Perfect little cunt. After that i told him not to talk to me again and that my family is deciding if we need to take legal action.

So this leads me to my question AITA for starting it?

input: Went on a date with this girl last night it was going extremely well and after we finished eating and bowling I asked if she wanted to come to my place for drinks/dessert. I'm 22 she's 19 for context, she says yeah and we're in the uber making out and I tell her after we hook up she has to leave because I have a big day at work the next day and I'm gonna be up at like 5:30 so need a few hours of sleep at least. She says yeah thats fine and I even say I'll pay for her uber back home. After we're done banging, I say hey take your time freshening up and shower or whatever you want and let me know when you're ready and I'll order the uber. She looks really sad at this point and just tells me to order it now and she'll wait for it in the lobby of where I live and looked super pissed. I say ahh alright np and she storms out, the uber was $50 btw in addition to the food drinks at the bowling place which I all paid for happily. I get a text at lunch when I'm at work saying I'm a dick, asshole, cunt little boy, not a man, etc from her for kicking her out and she says the sex was bad because I only lasted like 15 mins (thats long for me LOL). I didn't respond yet but am I really a dick in this scenario?

input: I'm 2 days post having a pretty intense facial surgery, excuse any errors. Had a total nose reconstruction. My bf and I are in a LDR with 16 hours of time difference. He works a very strenous job and values his time off and time with friends. We've been working out the kinks with the time difference, and he has told me multiple times that he will change his schedule to accomodate me for this surgery. I know there's not a lot he can do from a distance, but I've been struggling with pain, loneliness, and very slow recovery. I was hoping to watch Netflix together or something but on my surgery day he went and played a softball tournament, and I haven't talked to him much since. He's sent me memes and asked me how I'm feeling, and ordered a pizza to my house ( I appreciate the gesture but I can't chew anything). 

I woke up this morning very sick, puked all over myself, and was considering going to the ER cause of how terrible I felt. I FaceTimed him and he said he'll call me back, but didn't and fell asleep.  It's been 10 hours now and I suspect he's sleeping off a hangover. 

TLDR; had surgery, recovery isn't going as planned, and my LDR boyfriend hasn't been there for me as much as I expected.

Now complete the following example-
input: I’ll keep this short. I wouldn’t call this person and their family a friend to me but they are friends with my family. Hope that makes sense. Anyway they recently bought a house and needed help moving. Me, my brother and two of our friends should have said no when they weren’t even packed! But they said they would pay us for the inconvenience. Fast forward 5 hours later we had them all moved in. We had to lift crap up their awkward stairs, put together beds, etc. They had the heart to feed us ham sandwiches with old bread during lunch. 

I thought we would be paid $60 to $80 each. I’m lowballing myself but that was a ton of labor. Nope! They pulled a fast one on us and tried to pay my friends $20. Me and my brother were about to get nothing. Their reasoning for not paying me and my brother was they let us use their community pool for a summer when the guest membership is usually $100. I lost my shit and freaked out on them. I called them scum for lying to us. I called them cheap ass bastards as well. I was so angry I started to put some boxes back on the moving truck.  I told them karma is a bitch before his wife told us to leave or she would call the police. 


I know there were much better ways to handle a situation like that but I lost my cool. I was sore, hungry and tired. I embarrassed myself and my family because I freaked out in the garage which was open.

I got back home today, and they’re alive. They had food and water, but it seems like that’s all they did. They didn’t clean ANY of the bedding, and I know this because the bag I got before I left was still unopened. 
I also found accidents on my floor smeared and dried out, like they barely made an attempt to clean it up and just let it dry out.

Now complete the following example-
input: Yes, you read that right.

I've been running a dnd campaign since the beginning of last semester with some friends of mine at University. Unfortunately, some of those friends couldn't be here with us this semester, so we were looking for people to replace them so we could have a reasonable number of people for the campaign.

So me and my two remaining players are in recruitment mode. We'll call one of these players A.

Myself, A, and the other friend all manage to find one person each to join the campaign; that's a little more than I was hoping for (I just wanted enough regular players that it did not feel like I had to cancel if one person didn't show), but it'll work.

So, it turns out the person that A invited is a furry, and, I'm not gonna lie, it's makes me really uncomfortable. They wear cat ears and stuff all the time (from what I can tell), have some sort of sona thing on their lanyard, and unironically type and say things like ""owo"".

I recognize that this is me just being a bit prejudiced because they're not hurting anyone, it just makes me feel weird, and I have no doubt that I would be an asshole if I were to ask them not to be in the campaign just because of a lifestyle choice I'm not used to, but I feel like A should have at least asked us if we would be comfortable with someone like this in the game, you know?

Not only that but A seems to be a inconsiderate in general these days. He was late to both sessions so far, he invited his girlfriend (who I have met before, she's not a player) to spectate the game (which was in my apartment) without even asking. He has even asked twice now about extra people being added to the campaign after I initially said now (5 players is enough, thank you).

I don't know I feel like this could just be me overreacting and A just being a bit rude, or maybe neither of us are assholes and I'm just worried too much. Either way I have no idea what to think, so I thought I'd leave it to you guys to decide.

**TL;DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

Heres the story.

&amp;#x200B;

My and my friends were studying for an upcoming science test, we are all in the same grade nine science class and the test was in two periods. We had both periods to study and we were getting along fine until my friend who I will call ""M"" asked a question to the group. M and I have a shaky friendship but we've always gotten along fairly well. As M asked the question I went to answer, I hadn't answered any questions previously but as I started to speak M told me to shut up.

&amp;#x200B;

This went on for a while with her telling me to shut up every time I tried to answer a question until after about 5minutes, I tried to answer another question, this time instead of being told to shut up she slapped me on the leg. This surprised me but I didn't think much of it. As the studying went on she continued to slap me every time I attempted to answer a question, slapping me harder each time.

&amp;#x200B;

After I while I got pissed and told her she was being ""a little bitch and she should be physically abusing me for trying to get good marks in a class."" She lost it and starting attacking me over and over again by repeatedly slapping my arms which were raised over my head. 

&amp;#x200B;

I sent her a text apologizing for insulting her later that day but she still hasn't answered my (this happened two days ago).

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I called my friend a bitch for not letting me answer questions in our group study group and slapping me when I tried to answer them.

I am terrified of driving in the ice. I don’t have a car that's great in the snow and I don't have a lot of experience driving. I told my boss that I might not be able to come in and she is not answering me so I know she's pissed. I feel really bad and I do not want to call out but I really feel I would be putting my safety and my car at risk going in.

input: I really never thought I'd have something to post here.
TL;DR at the end since I might as well just explain the entire event.

So, my girlfriend moved in with me almost 2 years ago. About 6 months in she kept looking at cats on her phone and asking if I wanted one. We all know how this goes.

One day, I came home and my girlfriend asked if I ""wanted to meet the baby.""  I immediately understood she had gotten a cat, and figured it was a kitten based on her language. Now, we are an adoption ONLY household as well as immediate family. So, when I opened the door to our office and saw a fully grown, 13 pound apex hunter male cat staring back at me, I was surprised but not shocked. 

Fast forward about a year later, and I love this cat almost as much as my dog. One night, the cat got out when I let my dog out to pee. Since he was such a healthy, predatory cat, I had no fear for his safety when I find out in the morning. UNTIL, we didn't see the cat for 48 hours including a thunderstorm.

I had mentally accepted that the cat was gone or would be back in a week or two according to what I read online. 

In this time, my girlfriend had posted on our neighborhood page that our cat was missing. We got a message from someone we went to highschool with (we're in our early 20's), and he said it looked a lot like his cat that got away. The name our friend gave us was exactly the adopted name the cat had when we got him. He even has a sister that still lives there. 

I found my cat stuck in my neighbor's perfectly stacked woodpile (square cut) 3 days later. There were pieces missing from it that fit where he was stuck at. I'll leave what I'm saying for your imagination. The police had me grab him (she wouldn't let me on her property), and told me if he gets on her property again, my cat will have to ""find its own way out.""

What's also crazy is that our friend lives two streets away from us, but my girlfriend purchased the cat 6 miles away during a humane society outreach program that brought him from another 9 miles away. So, it's not like we found him outside.

Anyway, he obviously wanted his cat back and we told him no; it's our cat since we paid for him and have loved him as family for a year. If it had been any early before I gained feelings for the cat, I definitely would have given it to him and even felt good doing so.

TL;DR
Adopted a cat. The cat got out and our friend from highschool recognized the picture as his cat. We didn't give the cat back since we bought him and had a close bond with him for about a year.

We had a big heart-to-heart that seemed to sweep away lot of the messy initial dating debris and all was sexy sweet. Just before she left tonight, she said she doesn't want to go out to the club on friday and just wants to stay in an fuck. This struck me unexpectedly cold. BTW Our sex has been amazing. 

I have been enjoying getting close to her (It felt mutual) and exploring each other physically and mentally. Going to this club was a end of year blow-off and would involved a wonderful mix of dancing, drugs and intimacy. I dont really give THAT much of a fuck, but it did feel to me part of a formative process. 

AITA for feeling insecure?

Now complete the following example-
input: I feel this might come off as a bit immature, but here goes anyway.

Firstly, I’m 18, first year at uni, and still live at home with my parents. I’d just come home from work and was studying when my dad comes storming in demanding that I do my laundry. I ask him to wait a moment, telling him I’m in the middle of studying. 10 minutes later, he comes storming again, now accusing me of “never doing things the first time [he] asks”. At that point, I try to calmly point out that that was a little hypocritical, and that were many things I’ve had to ask for repeatedly. I pull out the example of giving the cash I’d earned from tutoring and asking him to deposit the money when he gets the opportunity. In response, he kicks the plastic laundry basket in my room, breaking off the handle in frustration (I was unharmed).
Turns out he used the money but was planning on paying me back with his own (which I’m totally fine with) and I tell him I totally fine with waiting. 
He continues to yell at me, calling me ungrateful, disrespectful and saying he’ll never forget this and I end up crying the entire night. We aren’t on speaking terms at the moment.

Are these accusations true? AITA?

input: My dads mother died when he was really young but I’ve always felt connected to her (I’m her namesake). 

My grandpa has been remarried all of my life to a manipulative and bossy woman who’s just kind of an all round ass. Recently things have escalated in her relationship and my dad and I have worked out that the constant ditching and having to prove my worth to her triggered a lot of my anxiety as a kid and my early teens. So I’ve decided I want to call her Margaret (her name) rather than Grandma cause I don’t think of her in that way anymore and I don’t want to dishonour my proper Gran’s memory in a way. 

I tried calling her Margaret when I was like 9 and told her she didn’t have to buy me a birthday present cause ‘she wasn’t proper family’ this ended up with her not talking to my parents for a year because in my head I was saving her money. 

I just feel like it’d be disrespectful to her but at the same time I don’t want to be calling her grandma out of force or her to talk shit about me to my brothers (7 and 3) which she’s been known to do. I’m just really confused about this but I don’t want to give her a title when I don’t consider her family. 

TLDR: My dads stepmum has been a bitch to me almost my entire life and I don’t want to call her grandma anymore but I’m worried it’ll affect my parents and brothers.

The latest example just happened. Tomorrow is our anniversary and we were talking about the present she gave me over a month ago because that's just how she does things. She asked me what I was going to get her and, after a long day at work, a busy evening and trying to get in bed we both forgot that I gave her a very thoughtful, very expensive (not that this should matter) present two weeks ago. I panicked and said I didn't know and that I had been really busy at work. She said ""Do you just not care anymore?"" And that broke by heart because I felt like such a disappointment to her. I said that I was sorry and excused myself so I could go have a quiet moment. Once she remembered that I did get her a present she apologized for making me sad but then expected me to just snap out of it. But I couldn't. I was hurt and angry because she just jumped to the fact that I don't care about her because of a present. I was withdrawn because I tend to shut down in these sorts of situations and she got mad at me for making her feel bad about what she said.

Now complete the following example-
input:  

I wanna start by saying that I've been in her position, and not like ""oh I've been depressed"" I mean like I have literally been in and out of that ward and know what it's like anyway.

My friend is early 20's, female and married with two kids. She's been having a tough time and has been diagnosed with depression, eventually she was admitted to the psych ward after asking to be for further assessment. During this time she's made some comments and done some things that have really pissed me off and I'll give you the top two.

First she made a post on FB saying something along the lines of ""i wanna go home I'm not crazy just depressed"", she went on to laugh and joke about some of the others who were psychotic and hallucinating and saying that some are just weird. This annoyed me to no end because I hate labeling people with mental illness as crazy, more so I was one of those ""crazies"" hallucinating and what not while I was in there but regardless I find her comments tasteless and down right shitty

Then when I saw her she told me that a nurse said something that upset her (essentially saying you have kids to think about and can't be overdosing and stuff), I don't agree with what he said, or at least not the way he said it. She went on to tell me, while laughing, that she flipped a table and threw a plate/food at his face, saying it was so funny and she laughed after she did it. Now this pissed me the hell off, I now work at a hospital (different one) and I've had all sorts thrown at me, but I never blamed the patient because they weren't aware (see: post op delirium sucks, UTI's turn grandma into the hulk and fuck dementia), she on the other hand knew what she was doing and not only found thought it was hilarious but said she'd do it again (she didn't like this nurse). I also want to say she has no history of rage or anger issues

I get that she's in a bad place, but I feel like her actions were shitty and childish. It's really made me reevaluate her as a person and as a friend if I'm honest but the more I think about it the worse I feel about judging her because I know it's hard when you're feeling so low and I know I haven't always been the nicest when I'm sick but I would never do that. When it comes to metal illness and throwing judgement around I just feel like a total asshole and it all hits a little to , so reddit, am I?

input: He's my older brother, I am 51 years old...so we aren't kids.  And yet I've had to hold him up, be his rock through all of his bad times, take care of him.  I'm talking HOURS on the phone so he can relieve our childhood and talk about our alcoholic/abusive mom (something I've made peace with decades ago and don't want to rehash), talk about his gorgeous daughter who is 22 and yet he hovers over non stop and complains that she can't be independent and how he thinks she is fucking up, talk about his ex wife, current girl friends, how much he misses our dad (passed away almost 8 years ago), work...EVERYTHING!  And yet whenever I tried talking about things in my life and need an ear he cuts me off, tells me to put on my big girl pants and grow up.  I have 2 boys with autism and when he drinks he says autism is not real, it's all bullshit, I need to be stricter, toughen them up, etc.  Anybody who knows me knows I don't coddle them, if anything  I ride them harder because they need to learn to adapt for the world, not the other way around.  They are good young men and we've worked very hard with them over the years and at times it was horribly tough with one of them, but I couldn't talk to my brother out it because he would just say, ""Fuck that autism bullshit!"".  It's hurtful and meant to hurt me.  Should I just accept his horrible behavior because he is drunk and keep letting him apologize when he sobers up?

Lately he has been lying, creating made up stories to cause fighting between family members.  I've called him out on it all, and he's admitted to it but then becomes a horrible prick..saying hurtful things one second and saying he loves us the next.

I really think he needs professional help, I can't be that person, I'm not qualified.  I've told him exactly that too, but it goes in one ear and out the other.

I finally just blocked him tonight, it's too draining emotionally and he is becoming angry and mean and I can't take it anymore.

But then I worry because he says I am the only person he can talk to.

So now I'm wondering AITA for blocking him?  Am I being selfish?  What if he does something stupid, will it be my fault for blocking him?

I didn’t grow up with a close family and have been more or less on my own with my husband and kids living overseas for my entire adult life. I’m not the type to send holiday cards out and I never stayed in touch with anyone from my family outside of a few random messages here and there. I’ve mostly only spent time with my husband’s family. We moved back to the states and back to my hometown a few years ago because I was having health problems during my pregnancy. Nobody lives here anymore except for my aunt and cousin. I had stayed with them for maybe a year or so when I was a child and my parents were getting a divorce. The time I spent with them was nice and I always looked back on that time fondly. My aunt and cousin visited across state lines during my first baby shower years later although I didn’t get to spend much time with them. During my time overseas I sent my aunt a rosary I bought at the Vatican (my family is Catholic. I’m not religious myself) and sent my cousin a gift card and some things from Europe when she had her first baby.

Since being back, they’ve made me feel welcome although there have been a few awkward moments... At one point my aunt and cousin separately asked if they could visit and have lunch with me on the same weekend, but shortly before that my cousin had mentioned she wasn’t getting along with my aunt. I wasn’t sure how to approach it. I didn’t want to insult anyone by inviting one and not the other, but I also didn’t want to get in the middle of it or somehow cause even bigger problems between them. So I ignored the messages. I admit, I could have handled it better by leaving it up to them to decide whether or not to spend time together or I could have made up an excuse, but I just didn’t think of that. Lies don’t come easy to me so I didn’t even see that as an option. Well, apparently the reason they asked to visit was because my sister had started chatting with our aunt more and had mentioned to them that I was kind of bummed I wouldn’t get to have a celebration for baby #2 since none of my friends live nearby. When I didn’t respond to them asking to visit, my aunt blew up at my sister and went on a rant about how, “Now she understands why my Dad dumped [us] for his new step-family,” and such. Basically weaponizing whatever my sister had confided in her about our family. It was weird. But after realizing what they were planning, I immediately apologized and explained I hadn’t wanted to get in the middle of whatever argument my cousin and her were having. My aunt responded huffily, but overall we moved past it. They threw me a baby shower and they were very generous and I was grateful.

At some point my aunt moved to a different house nearby and offered to let me have one of their older beater cars. I asked if she was sure that was okay and eventually accepted since we figured my husband could use it as a commute car. They went out of their way to get it to me because they couldn’t get it started and had it towed a few hours. We got a new battery for it and a few other parts, but could never keep it working past the first month. I never admitted that to her because I didn’t want to seem rude or ungrateful. My point in bringing it up is that they have tried to be generous and I try to make sure they know I’m appreciative. The gesture meant a lot and as they say, “It’s the thought that counts.” They invited me over for Easter and Christmas. The first Christmas was a little awkward because I brought flowers and food, but didn’t realize there would be a gift exchange (my husband’s family is a lot larger than mine so we rarely exchange gifts with any adults - just the kids).

My sister recently told me my aunt told her that my cousin feels like I’ve snubbed them. I guess because I never invite them over or something? I’m not totally sure since nobody said anything to me directly. Again, that’s not something I’m used to doing. With my husband’s family, we always meet at the house that’s biggest and my cousin’s house is much bigger than mine. I also had a specific reason not to invite them to anything last year. Last year, I found my older brother living in a kind of halfway home. He had basically been abandoned by our parents over a decade ago when he developed a mental illness. This has always been a sore spot in my immediate family and is the reason I’m not very close with my parents. My sister seemed to hold a grudge with them for the same reason. Long story short, we live nearby now and are better off financially these days so I let my brother move in hoping I could improve his quality of life. It lasted about 6 months, but unfortunately we couldn’t help as much as we thought we would be able to. He started having violent episodes and causing a lot of damage around our home. I was/am extremely saddened about the whole situation so I was pretty withdrawn over the holidays. The entire time my brother lived with me, my sister never asked about him or how I was doing which was a surprise since we literally spent the past decade complaining about how our parents should have done more for him. Over that period, my parents showed more concern than she did. Over the last few years I’ve come to realize my sister and I have very different values and priorities, but that’s a story for a different time... I ended up withdrawing from both Spring and Fall semesters (when my brother moved in and when he moved out). Summer I threw myself back into my classes and made A+ in all 4 courses. Point being, I was pretty busy last year between school and my brother and taking care of my regular duties as a mother.

My brother’s mental illness is unpredictable and given my family’s historical lack of interest in his well-being, I didn’t want to put my aunt and cousin on the spot by inviting them over to a situation they might be uncomfortable with. Again, perhaps I should’ve let them have the choice to decide what to do. I did post some pictures of us during the summer to show he was doing well (which he was, at first) and the food I had made. But I guess my aunt and cousin just took it as me having big parties and not inviting them. My sister said she tried to explain about my brother, which I’m kind of annoyed by. My sister is the type of person that always tries to put herself in a flattering spotlight and she really had nothing to do with my brother last year and I have no idea how she tried to spin it. She’s very much a know-it-all “I can do no wrong” type. Even after she supposedly explained to them, nobody reached out to me.

Am I the asshole for being reluctant to reach out to clear things up? I can admit that I haven’t reciprocated as much as I probably should have. I’m a bit socially awkward and having “family” nearby is just not something I’m used to so I don’t really think about it much if I’m honest. I’m an introvert and usually just wait for other people to do the inviting. They’ve done a lot for me and I appreciate it, but it bothers me that nobody’s talking to me about their feelings directly. It kind of leaves a bad taste in my mouth because it feels more like they’re gossiping. I also feel like overreacting is becoming a bit of a pattern with them. My frustration with my sister might also be adding to my reluctance to reach out since she’s apparently close to our aunt now.

Now complete the following example-
input: Ok, a little backstory first. I have two depressed friends, let's just call them Jane and John. Jane was the new girl in school and became a part of our friend group, which also involved John. John and Jane had a crush on each other and they both told me about it so I was like ""hey, you guys should go out"". And they did, and they had a good relationship for a while. Eventually, John just hardly ever talked to Jane outside of school and almost never interacted with Jane while in school so when Jane told me about this I was like ""hey, you should break up with him"". And they broke up. I feel incredibly guilty considering they're both depressed and John just told me that this break up made his depression worse. Part of me thinks I'm not the asshole because I got them together because I thought they were a match and in my opinion I had genuinely good intentions, but the other side of me thinks I'm guilty because what I did was VERY two-faced. I feel like if I didn't get them together in the first place, then there would be less pain on both sides. Am I the asshole?

input: So I (21 M) have a good friend, lets call him Greg(20 M) who has been showing serious signs of depression. He does nothing all day, just sits on the couch and plays video games, while sleeping 18 hours a day. He never cleans his room and is living in filth. His outlook on life has really gone downhill and he is always miserable. All of Greg's old interests he has since dropped. Me and my SO(his roommate) are really worried for him as friends. We have tried to help him by getting him out of the house or encouraging him to do things with us, but he just refuses.

Greg quit his job two month ago simply because he was tired of going to it. He told my SO and I that his parents pay for all his food, housing, and spending money under one condition: that he has a job. He has been lying to his parents about having a job. My SO and I have been considering informing his parents he quit his job. I think that if his parents found out he quit his job they might make him move back in with them which would motivate him to find a job, or give him the kick in the pants to actually get out of this hole he is in. WIBTA sticking my nose in places it doesn't belong?

Now complete the following example-
input: In the first week of the coding assignment I found myself stuck and when I asked for help I was only more confused as I found myself not able to understand through the really heavy greek inflection. There's another professor able to help, but unfortunately he has a serious lisp, and I don't understand him either.

I'm considering mailing the professor with the lisp for help, but I'm sure he'll tell me to come visit him in person and I really don't want to do that so I figure I should just come clean and tell him I don't understand him. 

Any other ideas of what I could do? Entering the 4th week of the assignment and I might've skipped the last 2 sessions out of shame, it shouldn't take me long to catch up if I could just understand the project but unfortunately my cohorts don't want to help me (which is understandable since I didn't show up the past 2 weeks).

Now complete the following example-
input: So about a year (maybe even two years) ago I was casually seeing this guy when out of nowhere he asks if anyone would want to take his three exotic lizards in hopes that when he moved out of his parents house he would get them back. Well I asked around and my four friends that lived together said they would take/watch them so him and I packed them up and brought them over. I had my dog with me though so while we went to his house, came back and set up the four foot tanks they eaxh had, my pup was locked in the bathroom so we wouldn't trip on her. While she was in the bathroom she managed to tare a pretty big chunk (about 6 inch by 4 inch) of their lanolioum floor up right in front (behind) of the door. My friends demanded I pay for it and I obviously agreed but I would be hiring a person and paying them because I don't trust them to actually use my money for its intended purposes. WEEEELLLL we agreed to wait until summer to get it done and during the period that we were waiting they told me they needed to get rid of the lizards and asked if I wanted them and I was all like fuck yea give me five days cuz that's my next day off and I'll gladly come pick them up.  The five days pass (It's now the Thursday I'm supposed to come get them), I get there aaand??? 

""Oh we sold the one lizard yesterday but you can still have the other two""
Like dude you sold my bfs lizards!? I was PISSED!! They said they would watch them and then when I said I'd take them they sell one!? So I was thinking about it and just kinda said fuck that, they can use the money they got for MY lizard to fix their fucking floor because you bet your sweet ass I didn't see a dime for the 400 dollar lizard or the like 300 dollar tank he came with and it all went towards weed. Honestly though I do feel kinda bad cuz I've been ghosting them since. So Reddit, AITA for thinking I shouldn't have to pay for their floors anymore? Should I just fork over the money?

input: So, first of all, obvious throwaway. Secondly, I'm on mobile, so excuse any formatting errors.

Bit of a background, I've decided a few years back, after a major pregnancy scare, that I'm not gonna leave something like this to chance, and I've got a vasectomy.

Fast forward 5 years, I'm in a relationship with this girl, our 1 year anniversary is coming up, and she decides to spring up on me, that she is pregnant. To this day, I'm amazed that I've kept my calm. I'm not going to lie here, I'm not a saint, in fact, I'm a pretty vindictive person. My first course of action was asking if she considered an abortion. After her stating, that having a child was one of her top priorities, the case was pretty much clear to me.

The whole gist of the matter, in my country, abortions are allowed until 16 weeks in. So I've waited, and bid my time to strike. I've waited the whole 16 weeks to make sure, then confronted her with the following: either we get a paternity test, or she fucks off immediately. Now I know that even a vasectomy isn't 100% safe, so I was fully prepared to take responsibility if the child was actually mine. Well, seems like I'm never going to know, as she vehemently refused testing, and broke down crying after me kicking her out.

TL;DR Girlfriend cheated on me, got pregnant, I've tricked her into believing that I belive it's mine until she couldn't abort anymore, then unceremoniously kicked her out and cut contact.

So, am I really the Asshole here?

Now complete the following example-
input: I have been recently informed by my wife, that I ignore my MIL, we live 1 hour away from both families, and visit them once in a month or two.

Now this requires a little more backstory and I will request your apology for I am on my phone and on a train.

The main story revolves around our wedding and the actors in this story are my mother, MIL, wife and me. (My father as any logical male avoids any wedding preparations for he knows he will be eaten alive by the female crew)

A short bio of the main cast:

Mother: kind, warm, social, the leader in her social group, lower middle class, touching love language, in debt from young foolish mistakes and the strongest woman I know.

Wife: smart af, kind, finished college, was a tomboy in he teens, has a silly personality, quality time love language, bad at reading people's expression and quite bad with interacting with humans.

Me: smart, gamer, in middle of engineering uni, big frame, kind, impossible to make angry, always smiles, touching love language, loves to help and confident.

MIL: raised her daughter alone, worked for the past 20 years 7 days a week as a house maid, no friends, gift love language, not in debt and lonely.

Happened two years ago, I decided to propose to my wife after finishing my mandatory army enlistment, all was great, we flew to Prague to marry(stupid laws in my country), her mother complained that she won't go if I invite more than 5 people, I did as I was instructed, 5 people came from my place, to my amazment I have an extended family in Germany, 30 people came from there, she was furious. At the ceremony her car arrived late and with all the confusion she was sat in the third row(me and my wife didn't notice) while my mother was in the first row, she was furious. Fastforward a year later, my family demand a ceremony in my country, me and wife agree. 

2 months before the ceremony I get a call from my mother, she was crying ( I have seen her cry scarcely mind you, this made me furious beyond my expectations) in short: allot of heated words were transfered mostly in the direction of my mother, which hurt her much, I immediately called my MIL and without thinking let loose my anger, frankly I don't remember what I mostly said, but that encounter left me distrustful of her.

Fast forward a week before the ceremony, my mother and father invited around 120 people who they know and respect, my MIL in law invited 6, called my wife and told her she won't come to such a big collection of people, left my wife in tears ( her reasoning are understandable, she has a tendency to distrust others, she feared all those people will come with out money and we will start our new life in debt), later stated the wedding will be the last thing she wants to do with my parents, mind you my father wanted to strangle her but kept his cool.

A year passed since and Everytime we visit the families, if I have to be in MIL house I try to be as quick in my visit as possible, I did this from intuition, I didn't notice this behaviour till last week when my wife mentioned it and revealed to me it hurt her MIL and her, afterwards asked me to not be an asshole and give her mother more from my time, to which I have yet answered, but truly desire to say ""fuck her"", AITA?

input: I have 2 friends, friend a and friend b.

Friend a: known him for the best part of 10 years, pretty much grew up with him. Got some mad memories with him and a strong bond. His parents have split and his mam lives next door to friend b with new husband and family. 

Friend b: haven't known him as long, only around a year and a half maybe 2 years, great guy, confided a lot in him as I trust him and he has confided so much in me.

Friend b used to (not sure if it happens anymore) have regular sex with friend a's mam who is married.

I have known for a while. I chose to keep it a secret from friend a. Still is a secret.

Would I be the asshole if I told friend a what happened between friend b and friend a's mam even though it has stopped?

I am an only child living in an appartment that my parents bought for me (not that uncommon where I am from).
My parents like to buy me nice things and give me me money every month. Not gonna lie, I enjoy this and I am very grateful for my situation.
I have told them that I don't love them because they buy me stuff, and that they don't need to do so. They respond buy telling me that I am their only child and they want to spend money on me.

I don't think my parents feel coerced into spoiling me and I could definitely make it on my own without their financial support (albeit with a little adjustment to my spending). But I still feel bad sometimes about their money when I am an adult. AITA?

input: At work i am a quality technician and my job is to make sure that certain temporary measurements are being followed to insure no bad parts make it past our operating lines. I spent 2 months instilling in my coworkers how important it is to follow these measurements and that the reason they stick around so long is because the problem keeps coming up again. To be specific, the same 2 problems keep reappearing every month. 

My job is to make sure that the bosses know that they aren't following the measurements and now they are becoming petty with me. I've tried working with them, tried telling them that literally what we're doing (our company makes car frames) is to protect the family or father or mother who buys our product safe. They don't seem to grasp this so i went and told the boss, after 4 hours of attempting to make peace, that they weren't doing their jobs. 

Now i finally got them doing their jobs but they seem to be doing it... almost like a petty temper tantrum child. They put the smallest mark possible which takes more time to place than just placing a long black mark. this seems so childish to me and they are now sneering at me and flipping me off when i walk by to do my job.

TLDR: My coworkers weren't doing their jobs even after 4 hours of trying to tell them how important this is to do so i went and told the boss they weren't doing their job. Am i the asshole for telling the boss on them?

I asked if we could go without a booking, assuming it wasn't to go to ER or anything like that and she said yes it will be fine as the GP will notify the hospital we are coming.

So with my work, I run my own company and don't have to report to anyone, but rather instruct stuff so I tied off the day and had a coffee meeting that was scheduled 15 mins after my wife had called and so I went to that on my way home (cafe in the lobby if building). This meeting took 30 minutes so I was on the train home by about an hour after the first call.

My wife called as I got into the train to check where I was and was very upset and shocked that I was only just getting in the train. She then explained the doctor wanted her at the hospital in no longer than 30 mins from her visit.

So I am another 40 mins from home making her well over that 30mins to get to the hospital.

Now complete the following example-
input: I don't think I've done this, but the offended party thinks that's the case. All names changed.

I hosted a game night with my husband, inviting four of our friends. It was semi regular, every other week or once a month at the same time due to some of the participants work schedules being tough to work around except for this one night every other week. Larry is my husband's best friend from childhood and earned the first invite. He brought along his girlfriend, Jessie, who has since become a good friend of mine, and also invited his co-worker, Rob. Our friend Ella also attended.

We had lots of fun! It kept up for a good year and a half of camaraderie. It's become one of the few things I enjoy during my week (I'm a newish mother of a 1 year old and struggle making new friends). I genuinely credit this game night with friends with part of my healing with my mental illness.

Then, Larry and Jessie broke up. It was nasty, with lots of hurt emotions, shouting, and the like. It had lasted almost three years by the time it was done. (For the record, they're better off broken up; things had gotten so toxic for both of them.)

Larry took things especially hard. He was clearly worried he was going to end up socially isolated, and myself, my husband, and Rob did our best to assure him he was our friend no matter what.

But then game night came around. I wanted to be fair, so I invited Rob and Ella and sent a separate message to Larry and Jessie, explaining they were both invited but if they wanted to come they had to commit to being civil with the other party. If they weren't comfortable doing that, we would hang out some other time.

Jessie said ""Yeah, I'm okay with seeing him, I can be polite."" Larry said, ""I don't want to see her,"" and I replied, ""okay, I'll make sure we grab lunch sometime this week to make up for it.""

Larry believed he should have been given some kind of preference because he's been my husband and my friend longer than Jessie. He complained about feeling abandoned. And even when Rob decided he would go over to hangout with Larry one on one after game night, Larry bitterly remarked that it was a 'pity visit'.

Jessie is disabled on multiple fronts and has very limited opportunities for socialization, plus I had genuinely become close friends with her - she's my daughters godmother. I couldn't just invited Larry and not her; it wasn't fair.

But part of me wonders if I wasn't fair to Larry by basically hanging out with his ex while he sat at home alone, even if he was the one who decided he didn't want to see Jessie.

It's been about four months since this went down, and not knowing if I did the right thing has eaten me up inside. I've stopped hosting game nights entirely because I feel so conflicted. Help me out so I can finally move past this and maybe get back to having fun with my friends...

input: Sorry for formatting on mobile 

So recently with Valentines day my girlfriend decided to get me a preserved rose (for those who don't know this is a rose that doesn't die and doesn't need watered). While I was out this morning my mum decided to spray the rose with some water, despite having been told that it's preserved and doesn't need water.

I come home with my girlfriend to find my rose sitting there looking like it's wilting. I am hugely upset by this and I want her to pay for the rose as its quite pricey.

This is where some context comes in.

About two months ago both her and my grandmother went halves on a new car for me and I am paying her back $200 with every paycheck I get (which is about a 5th of my paycheck, with the rest going into bills and savings).
Today happened to be one of her pay days (from me as she is unemployed and not actively looking for work) and I took out the cost of the rose from what I owe her for the fortnight. She immediately got angry and demanded the rest of the money. Its emotionally affected both me and my partner and is continuing to do so.

Now complete the following example-
input: My girlfriend (20F) and I (25F) are living in an apartment together and have been for a few months now. When I first moved in, I had to travel very far from where I lived with no job set up and a couple hundred in savings. I ended up not being able to find gainful employment, working odd jobs and bad hours for some time. For a while I had so little money I ate either rice and beans for a few days or did not eat at all. I did not ask her directly for food, but I did complain about the lack of it I had been eating. She fed me a handful of times, always choosing to buy me take out from a pricey restaurant, when I would have accepted any meal from anywhere. I figured she should have bought food from the grocery store and made it or have me make it because it would have been cheaper, but I kept my mouth closed because beggars can't be choosers, right? Eventually I found good, steady work, but not before I had to have her front me 2 months worth of rent, to pay my half. Last month, I finished paying her back, so we are even, but now our situation has changed a little.

&amp;#x200B;

She has started going to school, and is going full time while also trying to working part time. I say trying, because despite setting an alarm for 6 or 7 every morning to go to work before school, she turns off the alarm and goes to sleep until about 9am when she will then get up and get ready for school and skip work altogether (She is not in danger or losing her job, her bosses know the situation and are OK with her not showing up). Because of this lack of work, she is now struggling financially and often cannot afford to feed herself a healthy and stable diet, since she spends what little money she has on juul pods (and often a new Juul, too, because she loses them so frequently), cigarettes and gas for school and work. She also is planning on asking me to pay her half of the rent this month, meaning she would later owe me money (We've already discussed this and I agreed it makes sense, because we do HAVE to pay rent)

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I have been having is that she often eats the food I buy (she always asks first but I have a hard time saying no) and I will often buy food for a meal, cook it for myself intending it to be my meal for a few days so I can save money, but she will eat that, too. My problem is, I am making myself a pot roast tonight and I spent quite a bit of money on the materials (chuck roast is PRICEY) and I was hoping to be able to eat the whole thing over a few days. I preemptively asked her to not eat any of it, because its a nice treat for myself and it cost some money. She got a little upset and said its fair, but wishes I would share with her because she would share with me if I were in that situation. AITA for standing my ground and not sharing?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the very long post. Happy to answer any questions to clarify any parts.

input: As a note, my sister is a senior in HS and I’m a senior in college (also a girl). 

My sister, dad and I have errands to run that we need to do together today. 

At 10:10ish, my dad hopped in the shower. By 10:20 he was out and the bathroom was open. My sister and I both went to go take a shower at the exact same time and it went like this (Me - M, Sis - S)

M: Oo, could I possibly go first?

S: Are you gonna be quick? 

M: (thinking how I wanted to take a 20-30min shower to bask in the warm water) Alright, you go first then. 

M: (as she’s about to walk into the bathroom) But, are *you* gonna be quick? 

S: (rolls eyes) Uh, yea (with a ‘duh, obviously’ tone)

Then she shut the door. Here’s how the shower went: 

[10:31] Gets in bathroom
[10:46] Shower turns on 
[11:09] Shower turns off
[11:33] Comes out of bathroom and says it’s open

When I walked past her room to go take my shower, I leaned in and said “Last time I checked, taking an hour in the bathroom isn’t considered quick.” Then I shut the bathroom door. I took a regular shower and was out before 11:50 (that’s including showering, moisturizing after the shower, getting dressed, brushing my hair and brushing my teeth). I honestly don’t understand what she does in there for so long.

Now complete the following example-
input: AITA for setting a limit on giving Christmas gifts to my children (2Y &amp; NB) from their grandparents. 

We have asked every year that please do not buy our children lots of presents. We limit it to 4 presents where as an outfit (Top, bottom, socks) counts as 1 gift and the rest of the items (toys, books, shoes, etc...) count as 1. We don’t have a lot of room and don’t want our children to expect lots of gifts every year. We believe that Christmas is more about spending time with Family and not about how many gifts to give or receive. Also, we mention no large items. Again, we don’t have the room. 

My parents reluctantly give in to our demands, but my in-law (MIL) has a hard time following these guidelines. She flat out said I do not think I will be able to do this. 

Now, to give a little background. In the past, my parents would give around 10-15 gifts for their grandchildren. That’s a lot to me. They did the same to my siblings and myself growing up. Don’t get me wrong, I thank them for all they have provided but to me it’s too much. As for my MIL, she will give upwards of 40 gifts per grandchild and about 20 gifts to children and significant others. Not even all of the gifts are even wrapped. The gifts would range from little toys to playstations tp TV to MacBook and such. She would easily spend 15k-20k on Christmas alone and who knows what else during the year. 

So last year, my parents gave our daughter the 4 gifts but added a few extra items in her stocking. I was fine with that. My MIL gave 12 wrapped gifts, all with multiple items inside. So, I got up early and hid half the gifts so my daughter wouldn’t seen them. So it looked like she only bought 6. 

I know she has a spending problem. My wife’s siblings all say just accept the gifts and get rid of them when you get home or just give them a list of what you want so you don’t get crap. This goes for both themselves and their children. Last year, I just did not accept any gifts from her to me. My wife receive about 4 or 5 gifts plus a gift card. We both got significantly less than the others. I only ask because this year she mentioned that wasn’t able to do Christmas gifts this thanksgiving, we rotate holidays with my family and my wife’s, and that she will be mailing them to us. 

AITA for limiting gifts and refusing any that over the limit?

When I returned from school my mother referenced an inside joke I has with my sister that there was no way she would have known about, when I questioned her she admitted to reading my sisters letter but also said it's not like I was going and reading you're girlfriends letter. Now this was where I said that that violated my privacy and asked that she not do so and she became defensive and said I'll never enter enter you room again, and that she csnt believe that I'd be mad over something so small.

input: AITA for not being more useful for my organization?

My organization is made out of jeans and suit people. Jeans are my types; blue-collar workers and suits are admins and project managers.

I have a Ph.D but have been called an asshole for declining projects that make use of my Ph.D. as it is not in my current work detail. There is an appropriate pay scale for the type of work I am asked to do outside of my current detail that suits are not willing to pay for. They want to ask me to be on loan on their projects while still my branch paying me for the detail I was assigned. 

I am always down to make more money, but the suits do not want me to officially work for them nor bring me formally through the reassignment process into their branch. Their rationality is that I work for the organization regardless so I should do the detail. 

I just keep do what I do in the meantime.

input: I’m pregnant. My ex was abusive and I had to get a restraining order. He’s broken it multiple times. I’ve pressed charges. 

He still sends me  messages. Most are about wanting to be in our child’s life and I have a lot of guilt about keeping him away from our daughter. (Don’t get me wrong there are a lot of mean messages mixed in there too). I don’t trust him, he is violent and has a drug problem but I feel guilty because I will be keeping my daughter away from her father. Many people have said that there is no replacing her father and that they have a right to be in each other’s lives. 

He now says he’s given up on ever being apart of our lives and that it’s my fault our daughter won’t have a father. That I didn’t give him enough of a chance or that I can’t put the past behind me for the benefit of our daughter. 

So AITA for not giving him a chance to be in our daughters life? I know he’s an asshole but is it worse to keep my daughter totally in the dark about her father?

Now complete the following example-
input: So I’m in a quartet of high schoolers that formed spring of last year. I was actually invited to join them, as a former member had just quit and they needed another for some competitions they were planning.  I was never supposed to be a permanent member, but because we won all the competitions,  parents decided to keep it going into the following fall semester. The four of us were all going to be seniors, so I was a little hesitant to continue, knowing that college apps, and classes were going to take up a lot of time. 

Fast forward to now, I’m very heavily considering just quitting the group altogether because of the flakiness in some members.
For example:

The entire quartet would agree on coming in an hour early to work on our pieces. However, half of the quartet didn’t show up, and I was left wasting an hour of my time.

The same half would also often come to rehearsal late (~15 mins)

The same half would come to a performance with only ten minutes to warm up, when we all agreed to have an hour.

Rehearsals not led by a coach would be unproductive.

I have tried talking not only with the members, but to the parents themselves, but have seen no improvement of being on time.

I can’t be mad at any of the members, because it would ruin the entire rehearsal (quartets are all about communication)


Ive talked about quitting numerous times with my mom, citing the blatant disrespect, and the amount of time wasted on my weekends (~3 hours), but she thinks it would be an asshole move, considering I already agreed to commit last fall, and we have performances planned. As much as I understand my mom, I can’t help but still feel justified, considering I didn’t know about the flakiness last fall.

I definitely will consider just gritting my teeth through the rest f the semester, but WIBTA if I decided to quit?

Now complete the following example-
input: Disclaimer: I love my cat very much and I'm struggling to find the right solution so please don't be too hard on me 

My wife and I adopted a cat from a shelter last year and unfortunately it turns out she has a spinal injury  that causes issues when she squats, mainly a loss of sensation back there.  This leads to constant accidents around the house and anal glands needing to be drained, infections leading to vomit and constant visits to the vet. We've done everything we can including buying the most expensive fiber food to keep her stool soft, putting puppy pads around the house, we have tried multiple litters and litter boxes, nothing we do helps our cat. And it's worth mentioning that our cat seems very happy, she doesn't seem to be in any pain or suffering, just discomfort I think. 

The vet says there is nothing they can do to fix this aside from antibiotics and draining the anal glands when they fill up..short of that he said it's all just pain management.

I've brought up the possibility of moving her to the farm to be a farm cat (where they're very nicely taken care of) or finding her a new home or ultimately, putting her down... None of these suggestions go over well at all and leads to very tough arguments. 

AITA? 

Are there any other suggestions you have to give me some perspective

Now complete the following example-
input: some background, im a newish (9 months now yikes) developer at a large company, a couple weeks after i started the company had a new hire picnic sort of event, and I went met some people they seemed chill. One member I met invited to a get together over the weekend, and it was pretty much a board game night, we all brought some brews and played board games. It was all pretty chill, I don't think I made any weird faux pas or offended anyone, but we talked about doing like a korean bbq dinner sort of thing at some point, which i was cool with. As it turns out they went and made a private group channel on slack (communication/collab app with reactions) but I was never invited to that group. When I ran into the member who invited me initially I asked about the korean BBQ, and he said they already went and said we made an event in the slack channel (the one im not a member of), and I said oh im not a member, and he said oh well. 

&amp;#x200B;

so yeah for some reason they never invited me back in the group, I didn't bother asking why, I don't handle rejection well (\[ADHD reasons \] RSD ([https://www.additudemag.com/slideshows/adhd-emotions-how-they-affect-your-life/](https://www.additudemag.com/slideshows/adhd-emotions-how-they-affect-your-life/)), so I moved on. 

&amp;#x200B;

the problem is the members of this group are still part of my overarching org, im on a team within the org, and they're on another team within the org (i think 3 of them are actually on the same team so they sit in the same area etc), I've made my group of friends at this point so idrc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now my boss recently asked me to talk to one of the members about the stuff that she's been working on, because it's related to what I'm working on, and me (still hurt and confused about why i was rejected and excluded from the group in the first place) refused to, and am currently figuring out the implementation on my own. 

&amp;#x200B;

and yeah im a male, i could ""grow some balls"" in regards to the situation but fuck them, its not the exclusion that makes me angry, it's the fact that i was never told why. 

&amp;#x200B;

AITA for not wanting to work with any of them? Should i confront and ask why? Is it even worth it at this point ( i assume it is because professional stuff).

input: My sister(23f) and her fiance(22m) are going to be in my city for a wedding in a couple weeks and asked if they could stay the night with me to save costs. I actually have a wedding to go to that same weekend, but in a different state. I told her that it should be fine to stay in my room while I'm gone, but I'll double-check with my roommate L. 

L and I have been roommates for a few months and everything has been pretty good so far, save for a couple obstacles: I talked to her about getting a cat before I signed a lease and she said she was down for it...a couple months later, the opportunity arises to rescue a kitten and she vetoes the idea based off the fact I'm out of town 1-3 days a month. Fair enough, I understand her concern, even though my boyfriend said he would be willing to come by while I was gone so she didn't have to care for it. Speaking of boyfriends, she doesn't really allow him in our apartment. We don't do overnights(personal beliefs), but she doesn't like him to hang out at our place so we usually go to his. It's become increasingly frustrating, but whatever. Other than that and the fact that I feel like she isn't the best at picking up after herself, it's really not so bad. We're still friendly and I generally like her. 

Now, I ask L about having my sis and her fiance stay there. They'd get there late Friday night, have the wedding most of the day Saturday, stay the night again, and leave early Sunday morning. She says she's not comfortable with him staying overnight. While I want to respect her wishes, I also feel like it's kind of ridiculous because that's MY apartment too. The bedrooms have locks, they'll be there for maybe 16 hours total(all sleeping hours), and she can always stay at her mom's place which is 3 miles down the road. 

So Reddit WIBTA if I tell my roommate that I'm allowing my sis and her SO to stay anyways?

Now complete the following example-
input: Hello guys! There’s a lot to unpack here, I’ll leave a TL;DR at the bottom. Before I start, I’d like to say I really don’t believe in having “dibs” or like, owning people, but it’s a complicated situation 

I have been friends with this girl for a few years, and while she’s younger than me, she’s my closest girl friend and we get along really well. She’s been with me through a lot of hard things, such as a breakup with someone I dated for two years. 

Speaking of that relationship- it was with someone I’ll probably consider to be my highschool sweetheart(let’s call him Brody) , and was a tumultuous 2 years. I really loved him, but ultimately we fell out of love and he broke up with me May of last year, in a rather inconsiderate way (over text when he had plenty of opportunities to do it in person). I was pretty okay with it eventually, started seeing other people and so on. 

My best friend had been in a relationship with this guy we’ll call Adam for about a year. Adam is kind of a douche who doesn’t care about anyone but himself, up until he met my best friend. They were head over heels, but broke up that same summer.  My best friend was absolutely devistated. She hung out with Brody a lot as they had been friends for a while, almost as long as he and I dated. It made me uncomfortable, because I still harbored some ill will with Brody, but I kept my mouth shut. 

This fall, they got closer and closer, and my best friend one day while talking to me confessed that she had a feeling Brody liked her. I was hurt, and told her I didn’t really want to talk about it, that I was sorry but it was a sore subject. She agreed, said they’d never even be a thing, and dropped it. 

She denied being with him up until I caught him kissing her cheek once, where she fessed up. I got emotional (unfair, I know. I’m a teenage girl and sometimes cannot help it). She kept insisting “I don’t want to hurt you” and that if I told her not to pursue the relationship because it made me uncomfortable, she wouldn’t. I think it’s kind of bullshit, because what kind of friend would I be to tell her not to date someone?

So they date. They show up to my events, even cuddled in my bed at one point while I was STILL IN IT, and I get really upset about it. She knows the whole thing makes me upset. 

I’m still trying to get over it, and have come to the realization that I’m not fully over Brody.  Talking to my best friend yesterday, she confided in me that she doesn’t really feel the same way about him, that she was just lonely and hurting.  

Am I valid for being pissed that she pursued a relationship she didn’t even really care about despite knowing it hurt her friend? Or should I man up with my feelings and stop being a bitch? I’m worried I’m inserting myself into a story that doesn’t even involve me, but I just can’t even hear about Brody without hurting, a lot. 

TL;DR My best friend dates my long term ex despite knowing it upsets me, reveals she doesn’t even like him that much. Are my feelings valid?

     Awhile ago when my parents first decided to go through a divorce I decided to tell my two good friends about it on the way home from school. Since we were close I thought it might be important for them to know and I wanted someone to talk about it with anyway. At first I said ""my parents are going through a divorce"" and they didn't say anything. I didn't think they heard me so I said it two or three more times throughout the walk. Eventually one of them told me ""we heard you the first time so you don't need to keep saying it."" After that it was never brought up again.

     Am I the asshole for not reading the mood or are they the assholes for ignoring my issue and not showing any support as friends?

Now complete the following example-
input: *This is a throwaway account yada yada. If I’m declared an asshole I’ll be sure to apologize as soon as he gets home.*

Background:

My [23] boyfriend is notorious amongst our friend group to take party planning pretty seriously. He’s thrown at least 2-4 parties per friend costing around $300-$500 a piece. I’m the polar opposite, I enjoy having a small party, which consists of ordering food and weed for everyone to have a chill time. But since I knew my birthday was coming up I decided to not plan my own party and just let my boyfriend do his thing.

Incident:

I wake up on my birthday and my boyfriend doesn’t even remember to say happy birthday to me. Quite frankly I was hurt, since I expected anything birthday related from him and he normally goes above and beyond for all his friends. I said the normal good morning and went to my garden to water it. He opens the sliding door and yells “babe!” to which I turn to look, he says “I have to help *Lauren* fix her fridge, do you think you could help me with a couple of things?” I reply “sure” but I think he can tell I’m pretty bummed because he says “don’t worry, I’ll pick up Panda Express on the way home.”

I look at the list on the fridge and it’s an **assload** of stuff. Vacuum the floors, wash/put away the dishes, wipe down the dining tables and kitchen area and finally go drop off his aunts medicine to her. I was thinking that it would take at least 2-3 hours but I was fine with it because it was for our good mutual friend Lauren. 

After all the home related tasks were completed I hopped into my car and drove to his aunts house. Upon returning home, I hear a loud **”SURPRISE!”** and see my whole friend group and my boyfriend with tons of gifts and food. The party was pretty awesome, he even hired a local band I enjoy. I was happy, but also I was upset as hell that I did all of those chores essentially for my own party. I brought this up to him afterwards, to which he replied I had no respect for his time and consideration he put into my party and that those chores would have been needed to be done regardless. If it was up to me though, I’d rather spend my birthday chilling rather than doing chores for a big party.

Am I the asshole here?

Now complete the following example-
input: My father had an affair with my mother and I'm his first born. He stayed with his wife and had two children, a boy Les and a girl Em. He had very little contact with me and I've never spent one-on-one time with him, only with him and his family a hand full of times. I was raised by my uncle and grandmother and had didn't develop a relationship with my mother until I was eighteen. I remember my childhood being lonely and considered myself an only child and still do.

About five years ago when I was twenty, my father left his hospitalized wife and family. Em is twenty four and Les twenty now, they've contacted me multiple time over the past five years and the first time I responded by saying that I hope they're alright but I don't want to be involved in their lives. After that I've gotten lengthy aggressive messages from Em which I haven't responded too, they mostly say I hurt Les that he idolized me and anonymously follows my accounts, at some point he read a comment mentioning that I'm an only child and had a violent tantrum. That worries me because our father had anger issues and severe depression that I'm also dealing with. 

I'm not interested in relationship with them but feel like an asshole for not wanting to be in their lives during major life changes. AITA?

TL;DR: I'm my fathers first born from an affair, now he's left his family and his other two children want me in their life, I don't want to be and feel like an asshole, am I?

Now complete the following example-
input: My wife and I bought our first house back in July. We did the walk-throughs, the inspections, etc etc with no signs of any real problems. The previous owners did have about a dozen cats and the smell was... interesting.. Like cats and lavender air fresheners. We attributed it to just having that many fucking cats. We assumed when the owners, the cats, and all their shit was gone we'd be able to manage things with a thorough cleaning and some new paint. Holy shit were we wrong. Long story short I spent the first month of homeownership working all day (building someone else's house ironically enough) then coming to our house until midnight and ripping out oak flooring, subflooring, floor joists, drywall and framing in about 8 different spots. Words cannot describe how fucking gross it was when I got into it. Needless to say we weren't happy. We were pissed (no pun intended) at the Realtors, the home inspector and mostly the previous owners who, when confronted about it, told us ""we had no idea, good luck though"". FML 

Not much longer after the work was done and I could move my family in... the packages started arriving. It wasn't bad. Maybe one or two a month until Xmas then it was every week. Each time I received a text from her before I got home with some line like ""oh so sorry, we forgot to update our address"" or ""oh, this was something that was backordered"" each time saying it would be the last time. Seven months later and shit still shows up here. My wife and I hit the limit of our patience and told them any other packages or mail would either be sent back or I could invoice her $20 to handle the package. It was not about the money at all but more about them getting their shit together. I was met with a very pleasant ""fuck you, you don't touch our stuff"". Did I mention what class acts these people are? There's plenty more to the story but this is enough for context I think.

tl;dr previous homeowners ruined the house with cats marking, covered it up with air fresheners, played dumb when confronted and told me to go fuck myself when I asked them, after seven months and dozens of packages, to stop having things delivered here.

Now complete the following example-
input: My boyfriend (30M) and I (30F) recently moved in together. We've been dating just under 2 years &amp; we agreed to split rent and bills 50/50. We have similar income levels.

So, I get a food benefit in my job, where my company provides me with breakfast and lunch, coffee/drinks, snacks, etc. And for most of my weekday dinners and weekend meals, I either eat work leftovers (which I am happy to share with my bf) or very cheap groceries - canned black beans, oatmeal, etc. I spend about $25/week on groceries.

My boyfriend's job doesn't provide food, so he spends a lot more on groceries. He suggested that we should also be splitting the grocery bill 50/50. I disagree because I feel like I'm getting the short end of the stick, and I am happy to just to cook and eat separately for the most part. 

I should say I think he views splitting food as having an emotional benefit primarily, with a secondary convenience factor. Groceries aren't a financial burden at our income levels. I don't think he cares about the financial part much. I care about the financial part because I have aggressive savings goals.

We had a recent conflict about this because I came in late from a flight one night, and our city is covered in exceptional amounts of snow right now so all the grocery stores and restaurants were closed down. I ate a small amount of his food that he offered me - a protein bar and some milk and cereal. The next morning he made coffee and breakfast and offered some to me while I was still in bed, I had about a cup of coffee and declined the food just because I wasn't feeling like that particular meal right then.

After that we went to the grocery store together and he wanted us to split the bill from the groceries he bought himself. I was like, we talked about this and agreed not to split and just eat our own food, and he said ""oh so the food and coffee you had yesterday just fell out of the sky then?"" I said that I would be happy to pay him for that given the exceptional circumstances, and he said no, he just wishes we were combining our households more.

Now complete the following example-
input: TL;DR: My ex had my cats. I told him I was coming to get them and that I would bring the cops if necessary. I was aware he had drugs in the house. I learned after the fact that he also had a gun there, which he is legally not allowed to possess. I called to let him know I was on my way. He got irate and was ranting and cussing at me. I hung up on him and proceeded to show up with cops. Evidently this makes me the asshole?

&amp;#x200B;

So my ex is psychotic. In the last 8 (of a total 15) months, he has at various times threatened me, my friends, my cats and my infant daughter in an attempt to control/coerce me into giving him information that, to the best of my knowledge, does not even exist. I didn't realize I was going to hit ""Fuck it. Done. Get out of my life."" until the very moment it happened, and so had not properly prepared. Namely, I had left my cats at his house. Psycho has a lengthy arrest record and a tendency toward aggression and a complete lack of regard for other individuals. In the days following the breakup, our communications went something like: ""I want my cats back."" ""Fuck you, They want to stay here."" ""I'm coming to get them."" ""They won't be here."" until finally, verbatim, the message I sent was, ""Look. This is how this is going to work. I'm coming to get the cats. I'll call when I'm on my way so that you can have them ready. I'll bring the cops with me if I have to.""  When I was on my way, I called, and he started ranting a bunch of bullshit,""Fuck you, you're not stepping one foot in my house. Don't even pull in the drive. I'm not giving you shit. You're not taking shit from here."" So I hung up and called police - non-emergency - to have a cop on-hand in an attempt to reduce the likelihood of an altercation. Yesterday I found out he called my mother after the cops and I had left and lied through his teeth about me. I got pissy, and reiterated my desire to **not** see him in person. He responded by getting super upset because I brought the cops to his house when he had drugs and a gun there. (He's explicitly not allowed to be in possession of a firearm, as he has two gun-related felonies under his belt.)  Apparently the existence of police in that situation warranted a response. He failed to factor in that my mother can't stand him, thinks he's a scumbag, and doesn't believe a word he says any other day of the week. (He's firmly convinced she adores him, which I think is mostly a testament to his delusional state of mind.)

There's a whole bunch of shit I'm leaving out - the manipulation, the scare-tactics, the invasions of privacy and space and boundaries, not to mention the circumstances surrounding the aforementioned threats on the lives and safety of myself and those I care most for (which is why they were the people he threatened to harm, of course.) But I feel like once I get started, this post is going to steadily devolve into me just going on this long-winded diatribe about my asshole ex, and will thus detract from it's purpose which is to find out, was I actually wrong? Given his history and the fact that I told him I was going to do a thing I then proceeded to do, was I actually the asshole for showing up, police at the ready? There are some people who have a firm, ""You don't call the cops. You don't bring cops to my door."" mindset. And honestly, I personally have a massive bias against police. But they exist for a purpose, and while I don't really think breakup-mediation is typically something they should have to be called-upon for, I also feel like it was the least worst of a bunch of terrible options. Am I wrong?

Today my girlfriend’s brother brought his family (wife, 2 kids 5 and 1) over to our 2 bedroom apartment with little notification. Just traveling through for the holidays I believe.  With her mother coming over of course (she’s over regularly no problems).

About 2 years ago me and her brother had gotten into a argument after I got drunk and went fishing with my brother. I came home and he kicked me out of their moms house who I was staying with at the time. I was also paying bills and doing my part. So we just normally don’t talk to each other and have not a lot in common with him being more religious.

The problem is they come over and my girlfriend says they can sleep on our bed while I sleep on the couch. With her mom, our 2 year old and gf make a pallet on the floor for themselves. This is my first apartment I didn’t see that as fair, but seeing as she’d told them already, I left and went to my brothers apartment. I have never stayed the night at his house so idk if he lets them sleep on his bed or anything.

I always help my family with anything and everything they ever ask for. I just don't like the idea of Christmas gift giving. In today's culture they make me out to be a terrible person for not giving everyone gifts. AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: Went to see ""Us"" by myself last night in a theater. (It was awesome, by the way.) Got in just as it was about to start. I see a single open seat in the middle of the theater, middle of the row, just next to the walking path to the other side... I hope that makes sense. There were a group of three ladies on one side, and a couple (young, female next to the seat, male next to her). It was a small theater and was mostly full except for a handful of end-row seats. The whole row looked like this:

  (More seating up here)

\_ X X \_ X X X \_

\_\_(front walking isle)\_\_

 (More seating below)

So I asked if that middle spot was available, and the girl of the couple moved her purse out of it for me. I said thanks, sat down, then her dude said:

BF: Aren't there any other seats?

Me: Uh... sure, there's one next to you and a couple up there. Why, do you not want me to sit here?

BF: ...It's just weird. 

The movie was just starting so we both sat back. But I guess I just didn't understand why it was weird. I am pretty fluent in social norms. I'm also 36 and don't mind seeing movies alone. To me, if there's an open seat in a full theater, I'll take it. I felt like it was weird that he thought it was weird. I told myself that he's just young (probably around 20) and naive.

Context: I don't smell bad, don't look like a threat. Just a normal dude. After the movie, they left first and there wasn't a word between us. But I just can't shake it and wanted some outside opinions.

Should I have not taken the empty seat? Was I the asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 6 months. Something I am a little concerned about is the topic of me becoming pregnant. This is totally hypothetical as I am not pregnant, and do not plan on getting pregnant any time soon. The only form of contraception we use is birth control, which I take religiously, so the chances of me becoming pregnant are very slim. However, as two adults actively doing the act, the chance of pregnancy is still there, and I think it’s important to discuss the possible consequences. My boyfriend says that if I get pregnant and decide to keep the kid, he will leave. He will not pay child support. He will not be involved. End of discussion. To him, in the off chance I do get pregnant, getting an abortion is the only option if I want to stay with him. I’ve told him that I am in no way ready for kids either, but it is also very off-putting that if the situation did arise, my only choices would be abortion or becoming a single parent. Again, the chances of me becoming pregnant are very slim, but I still don’t like my boyfriend’s attitude towards the situation. So, AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: My (27f) have been living with my brother (32m) for the past 7 years. We've lived in the same house the whole time. 2 years ago I bought the house and have been renting it out to my brother and a roommate. Their rent is super cheap with all bills are included, and I haven't raised it even though my taxes have gone up about $400 a month in the past 2 years. I also pay for all the communal house supplies like detergent, paper towels, towel paper, etc.  I have also paid for pest control that he caused (I won't go into details because then someone might recognize him from the post), even though it wasn't my fault, wasn't in my room, and cost nearly $3000. He never offered to pay or to help out. 

&amp;#x200B;

My brother doesn't have a college degree but he has a decent job as a warehouse manager. The problem is that he hasn't paid his rent on time in more than a year and a half. April is in 2 days and he hasn't paid me a cent for March. Every time I bring it up he says he is trying his hardest and he has anxiety. I know he could pay his rent on time if he tried. He never cooks at home, never takes his lunch to work, and goes out drinking with his friends at least once a week. And this isn't the first time he's done this type of thing to me. He rented my old car from me until it broke down for good and never paid for it. Nothing. He drove it for months.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like he's just taking advantage of me because I'm his sister and I'm getting sick of it. The extra money each month is really nice but I don't need it. I felt like I've e let him walk all over me. I think he needs a real kick in the ass. I'm done enabling him. I'm going to change the WiFi password and not tell him since technically he hasn't paid for it. I will give him the password when he is caught up on his rent. But what I really want to do is tell him the next time his rent is late, starting in May because there is no way he will be on time on April, that he has has a month to find a new place to live. My Dad has offered to employ him and give him a place to live for free, and my mom has told him that after my sister moves out he can live with her, also for free, while he goes back to school but he's chosen not to. Will I be the asshole if I tell my brother to grow the f up and pay his rent on time or he needs to find a new place to live?

Tonight is extra frustrating because he’s decided to curl up right next to me, squishing me in a dog-man sandwich between himself and my boyfriend. I tried to poke him a little to move and he gave me a warning growl and showed me some angry teeths so I tricked him to come out by going to the kitchen and acting like I was eating some food, his big weakness.

Now complete the following example-
input: My girlfriend are long distance(Kind of, ~1hour drive). We basically only see each other on weekends as we have school and work on weekdays. We try to switch houses weekends to keep things fair. 

This upcoming weekend is her weekend but a school club I recently joined is having a party on Friday night. I knew this a week ago and I checked in with her to make sure it was okay for us to go and asked her if she would want to take the bus down to my house, go to the party that night, and then take the bus back up to her house for the rest of the weekend. She agreed to travel down on her weekend. Other small notes: We are also going to a friends going away party Saturday night in her hometown and I have also agreed to DJ this party and judge the competition going on that night.

Then on Tuesday, her new job told her if she could work on Friday night and she agreed. Since she now works on Friday night she can't get on any buses to take her down to see me since there are no buses running that route that late at night. We are both trying to save money since we don't have that much so she doesn't want to drive her car down. I did tell her that she shouldn't go back on her word since it's a new job and she should do everything to look good towards her new bosses. 

Now she wants me to cancel my DJ gig and my judging that I had already committed to, to come up and spend that night with her. I agreed that I can just come up the next morning after the party but that isn't good enough for her and she wants me to come up as soon as I get out of class on Friday. She says that since it is her weekend and she wants to see me, that she gets priority and that I should cancel going to the party.

I understand we don't get to see each other as much as we want to but I feel like I took every right step towards making sure it was okay to go to this party and it was her mistake to agree to working late that fucked things up. I also understand that it's her weekend but I already made my commitment to my friends to go to the party when she told me it was okay to do so. This club is also a great group of friends that I want to hang out with more. She thinks that since I want to go to the party, this means that I value the new friends more than her. So that's where things are now. Am I the asshole for wanting to go to this party when my girlfriend can't go?

Now complete the following example-
input: A couple days ago I got a new cat. It’s a black kitty that I found roaming around at night. It’s definitely a stray and not a wild cat because it was very sweet and had no problem brushing up on a stranger. Don’t be alarmed, I’m not planing on keeping it if it’s owner shows up. I’ve posted it on several local missing pet Facebook groups to see if I can find an owner. 

Anyway, this is the second cat I have with my boyfriend along with a pug. This cat is very clean and doesn’t shed at all. Tonight me and my boyfriend got into a fight because he doesn’t wanna sleep in a bed with a cat. This just completely baffles me because we have slept in a bed with the other cat who is more outdoors and is much more unkempt. She sheds and is a little smelly but he has never noted a problem sleeping in a bed with her. We both have allergies to cats but truly I haven’t seen him have a flare up from the cats. 

The argument consisted of him telling me that he can’t sleep with me if the cat is on the bed because it just grosses him out so much that the cat is near the pillows (not touching). He has brought the dog up onto the bed on multiple occasions and I am extremely allergic to dogs. I never complain because it makes him happy. Now once I get a new sweet kitty, it has to be a big deal. At the end of it he told me I had to choose to sleep with him or the cat and after hearing him yell at me and look down at the sweet little kitty I told him he can go sleep alone.  Am I the asshole?

input: In high school I went through a rough patch but before my senior year started, I moved across the country. After about a week or so I just stopped talking to them because it is hard to keep up contact with a lot of people when you move far away. Now, here’s where it gets murky:
I don’t really regret cutting off contact with them, and I did not regret it at the time either. I’ve moved 15+ times in 18 years, so friendships dying off is normal, except I definitely needed my friends from a year ago when I was going through that rough time, and I feel like I should have continued our friendships because they tried to help me through that time in my life.

Now complete the following example-
input: Context: My mom is one of the top dog obedience handlers in the country. She trains and shows springer spaniels, and I grew up with 3-5 springers in the house at any given time. When I was 12, she bought me a springer, Luna, to show and train and I spent a good portion of my high school years in the obedience ring. Luna passed away five years ago, and I haven't had a dog since.

My husband and I have been planning to get a dog for more than a year. The reason we've waited so long is because my mom occasionally breeds litters to further her line of springers. She currently has one bitch that can be bred who was supposed to come into season in August. She still hasn't come into season eight months later, and we're getting to the point where we can't wait forever. We are planning to start trying for a baby this fall, and since I'm going to be the one training our dog, I'd like to get puppy settled and house trained before I'm potentially dealing with morning sickness, etc..

My husband and I talked this over and we decided that if my mom's dog isn't pregnant by June, we will get a different dog. I would love nothing more than to have one of my mom's springers, but it's more important to me to just get a dog than to get a dog from my mom's line. 

I would still prefer to get a springer. I know this breed like the back of my hand, and I plan to train the dog in obedience and potentially agility. I want an outgoing, high-energy working dog. This dog would be a companion first, but would also be my partner in this sport. It's important to me to get a puppy so I can properly socialize it, especially by bringing it around my friends' kids so it's used to children by the time we have our own. 

I've talked through the dog situation with a few friends, and have told them my plans to get a springer even if my mom's litter doesn't pan out. I had a few people recommend shelters where they got their dogs. I am open to looking at rescue puppies, but I'm leaning much more heavily toward getting a springer from a reputable breeder. 

Pretty much everyone I've told about my plans to get a purebred have been judgmental and unsupportive. I've been scolded with the ""adopt, don't shop"" mantra and asked why I would buy a purebred when so many shelter dogs need loving homes. I think rescuing a dog is a wonderful thing, and I give people who choose that option a lot of credit. But I don't agree with this idea that shelters are the ONLY morally acceptable option for getting a dog. 

I'm sorry, but I do not want a dog with built in behavioral issues. Shelter dogs are a toss up in terms of temperament, potential health issues, and how the puppy was socialized early on. I do not want an abused dog that will be fearful or potentially aggressive. 

WIBTA if I get a purebred dog?

input: I am so sorry guys this is a long one, I’ve never been very good at summarising.

So my partner is quite physically fit and this has unfortunately made me very conscious of my body.

For Vday I decided I would do something special and bought some lingerie(he always points some out and makes jokes and I was thinking is he trying to hint something?)  and wear it for him and this is a big thing for me as unlike my past partners I am not completely confident with my body in front of him.

He did a lot for me, booked dinner, bought and made me a bouquet of nuggets which was really cool except for the fact that he ignored me and was stuck on his phone once he gave them to me and sending it too his friends, so I kind of just ended up sitting there waiting for thirty minutes to talk to him.

After this we went to dinner and he still is ignoring me here and there because he is on his phone but food was nice and with a lot of effort on my part our conversations were ok. He was even kind enough to pay for dinner(usually a splits kinda girl).

When we got home he was already falling asleep- I told him that I wanted to do something with him tonight and to please not pass out when we get home. I also had made his favourite dessert which he then complained when I served it to him , I was a litre confused because in the car he said he wanted to eat it when we got home. 

I then say maybe you should go have a shower to wake up more and he does but then when I’m in the shower (3 minutes I’m very quick ) he falls asleep.

I put on the lingerie on and try to wake him up but it’s useless and he goes back to sleep and just turns away, this happens three times.

At this point I’m really upset because I’ve spent quite a bit money and was excited to do something for him but he doesn’t care or even want to do anything. 

I felt really hurt because I’ve been telling him how excited I was to show him and he just couldn’t care less or pretend to.

I then change and go back to bed and all he said is are you angry at me. To which I replied Valentine’s Day is over now anyway so just go back to sleep and cue turning away.

It should be noted that multiple times I’ve tried to do things for him and he constantly just ignored me.

input: I'll start with this: I'm not under any NDA, non-compete, or other legally-binding agreement that prohibits me from doing what I'm doing.  Also, all the software I'm using is open-source, except for the parts I developed in the past few months, and the open-source pieces are really the valuable portions of the software I've developed.

I worked for a software company about ten years ago; during my tenure, they released a lot of their core code as open-source, for reasons I've never understood.

At the time, I pointed out that anyone could use their code to compete with them in the marketplace, but my opinion was ignored.  I built a demo and had long, drawn out arguments over e-mail with the leadership but in the end I was told to shut up and color.

I quit and started work for my current company, writing unrelated software.  Since I left, my former company has not only maintained their open-source baseline but has actually taken it up a notch and released even more really cool software into the public domain (Apache 2 License).

A few business opportunities came up last year on which my current company wants to compete.   I took the open-source code and created an application that works pretty well.  

I asked my previous company if they want to partner going forward, but I have not been getting a warm reception.  I said that if they don't want to partner, I'd be selling it to everyone (including their competition), and this really made them upset.

So, AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: So for context my wife and I have a good group of friends and in that group we know someone named 'Liz' (hiding real name for her privacy). She's 35 and was married for almost 5 years but divorced her husband on account of infidelity on his part.

She's always been very timid and reserved. It's not the worst thing in the world but since the divorce she really seems to love attention from men. She's been seeing this guy for a bit and he seems nice. We were having a birthday party for one of our mutual friends so my wife and I invite Liz and her new boyfriend.

He doesn't show up but she does. She says he's working. Which was kind of weird this is at 8 PM and the guy works at a bank. So it's just odd I know there's always a chance but it threw me off. Also at the party was 'Brad' (also not real name). He's been single now for 5ish years and I can tell he's very anxious. He's been taken advantage of by various women because he tends to commit and overlook some really bad traits.

So at the party Liz starts talking to Brad and Brad gets infatuated with her. He's letting her drink his beer, he's grabbing her food, he's head over heels for her and this is an hour in to them meeting. I take Liz aside and ask her to not lead Brad on. I know how he is and can see that it's not going to end well. Well she snaps at me and storms out. Brad follows. Then a few others leave.

Wife's now mad at me for 'ruining the party' but in my opinion it was lose-lose either she was gonna lead him on and that comes crashing down or I bring it up and stop the awkward train wreck but deal with the fallout.

What do you all think? AITA? Could I have handled this better?

Now complete the following example-
input: So 3 of us (me, my ex, and my friend) go to the same class we are all 17 years old, and recently, my gf(I'll refer to her as N) and I broke up.It was mostly mutual, but i feel like she broke up with me more than i broke up with her and i still like her.                   
                                    
So it's been 4 months since we stopped dating and in that time i noticed my friend, who we'll call P, getting closer with her, which is fine it's okay for them to be friends i can't tell him or her who to be friends with.BUT here is where i see some red flags, from time to time i see him being flirty and getting closer to her, he spends time with her friends who he said he hates multiple times while i was with N and even after that.              
                    
Now i know N would never be with P, she pretty much looks at him like at a gay friend and i'm sure of it, i know things can change but i'm pretty sure she is just friends with him and will continue to be.But my friend seems like he likes her, i asked him a few times, and was told by him that my 2 other friends already told him to cut that stuff out because they thought it's not cool.What broke the camels back was him getting very close and touchy with her, she didn't reciprocate it and moved a little.Now that got me mad and i told him that if he continues with that stuff we couldn't be friends and asked him to cut it out, he got very defensive and kept saying he doesn't know what i'm talking about and that he is just her friend even tho it doesn't look like that to me or to 3-4 other friends.          
             
Since then i haven't said a word to him, basically ignoring him.He didn't say anything either in last 5 days and continued talking to N, looks like this friendship means very little to him.I'm gonna talk it out with him if he says something first, but i'm not going to be the one to talk to him first cause i feel like i'm in the right here.             
                  
             
TL;DR:My friend of 2 years, started getting closer to my ex which who i broken up 3 months ago, both me and my friends noticed this and I talked to him about it, he got very defensive and i started ignoring him.Friends says i'm overreacting because we've been friend for 2 years which makes me think that *maybe* i'm the asshole, what do you guys think?

Now complete the following example-
input: **TL;DR** because it's longer than it needs: I sigh because someone called a known woman a slut. This person takes it badly because it was condescending. I want to drop the subject but he keeps arguing. Points out how angry I'm getting, storms off and leave. His brother catches up to me and asks me why I got angry, but doesn't seem to agree with my feeling that I got angered. I get remorse for ruining the party's mood, so I come back and apologize. I get what feels to me like snark in response. I drop it entirely but my ego is still hurt to this day.



Hey everyone, I'm posting my story here because the people that were witnesses will dodge the question if I ask them their opinion about it. I'll be, at least try to, be the most truthful I can, but I'm a faillible human and the way I recount this event might be biased. Don't hesitate to point it out if you feel that it's the case.



A few months ago, I was at a chill little party with a group of friends, we were six people. I'll name two of them: B, the party's host, we're long time friends and even shared a dorm in high school, and his big brother L, who I'm familiar with because he's been present at quite a few of B's parties, but isn't someone I usually hang out with. It seems releavant to note that there was only one girl at the party, and that everyone else including me were dudes.



We were playing a trivia games in teams of two, and I teamed up with L. It goes well, until the point where a card mentions my country's counterpart to Vanna White from our version of The Wheel of Fortune. L says ""ah yeah, the slut!""



I'm not here to argue about sexism, so I don't call him out on it, but I don't like that remark so I let out a sigh that's loud enough to get heard by L. He gets defensive, and this conversation ensues: 


**L**: ""What? That's what she is, she's a slut"". 


**Me**: ""I don't think you should call women sluts even though her job is to look pretty on TV""


**L**: ""But that's litterally the definition of what she is! She sells and displays her body, so she's a slut! You and I don't even know her and will never meet her anyway, so what's wrong with calling her a slut?""



This goes back and forth for a little while, and I feel like he's trying to say the word ""slut"" as much as he can to get a raise out of me. I get exasperated because it's clear that neither of us is willing to change opinions. I also can see the mood is degrading as the rest of the people present fall silent and have their attention focused on us. I ask L ""I want to stop talking about this, can we go back to the game?"", in a clearly annoyed tone.


**L**: ""but Siphonay, you have to understand that you have your opinions, but that most people disagree with you"", ""you shouldn't be so condescending because you think you have the right opinions"". 



I start getting angry and ask him how I was condescending.


**L**: ""well you sighed when I said that Victoria is a slut, it was really condescending and you clearly feel superior and think I'm a misogynistic asshole""


**Me**: ""I never called you that, I just expressed that I didn't like what you said! I wanted to keep playing nontheless! Stop taking me for an fucking idiot, I know you're trying to make me angry on purpose!""



At this point, I've lost my temper and I'm screaming. Everyone else in the room is silent. A friend interjects calmly ""you shouldn't get this angry, but I agree that L's words to express his opinions are harsh, and probably not the right ones""


**Me**: ""it's not about that anymore, I just wanted to keep playing the fucking game and he keeps pissing me off with this! He's fucking with me!""


**L**: ""I'm fucking with you? You're so childish for getting so angry and vulgar over me calling her a slut, you don't want to take any responsibility for your behavior""



I'm really freaking out. I try saying that I'm more angry about him sealioning me than what he initially said. He keeps calling me a condescending white knight, so I snap and call him a fucking asshole, which makes things worse.



At one point, I realise I ruined the night. I stop talking, pick up my shoes and heads out. L tells me ""that's it, storm off like a civilized adult, you're such a pleasant person"", sarcastically, of course.



I walk back home, boiling inside but I feel really bad for ruining the evening. B catches up with me on bike, stops me, and asks me calmly why I got so angry, telling me I ruined the mood and everyone's got so silent.



**Me**: ""Don't you feel like he was taking the piss at me and getting me angry on purpose? Because that's how I felt""

**B**: ""He wasn't angering you on purpose, you just both got big egos that clashed. But nobody back here knows why you got so angry over *litterally nothing*. Are you okay?""



I burst into tears because of the remorse I have, and I explain to him that, as he knows, I have anger issues that I pretty much can contain nowadays, but (back when this happened), I'm in a pretty rough life situation and had to adjust to a sudden change, so my temper was shorter than usual, but that it's not an excuse for what I did. I also explained to him that, I did not come to argue about that, and that at this point I didn't care who was right or wrong, I wanted to drop the subject because I felt it was not the time and place to do so, and that as much as he was calling me childish and immature for getting angry, he didn't try once to appease the situation.



B doesn't reply to that, and there's a pause for a few seconds, I collect myself, and ask B ""Do you think I should come back and apologize?""
He tells me that I can if I want.



So I head back to his place with him. I'm still pretty shaken and I'm clearly holding back tears while I'm saying it:



""First off, I want to apologize to you, L. I realized that sighing in exasperation when someone says something is condescending and that it's normal that they don't react well to that. It was rude, and I shouldn't have done it. And I want to apologize to everyone else for being unable to control my temper, and for ruining what was an enjoyable night.""



Here's L's reply: ""It's good that you found the courage to come back and apologize. I hope that one day you manage to overcome your psychological issues.""



This answer didn't please me, and that's quite the euphemism. I felt my apology was genuine, because I really felt bad about what I did, and getting so angry, and turning everyone's good time into a bad time. I expected him to apologize, in turn, for whatever. Maybe for using the language he used, or maybe for not trying to calm down the situation. But it seemed to me that he thought only I was responsible for what happened.



I didn't reply, I just sat down. The game didn't resume, but we dropped the subject, everyone started to talk again, even me, even L, sometimes to each other, without hostility. It seemed to have become a chill party again, but calmer and less lively. It got late and everyone left normally like nothing ever happened.



This was probably way longer that it should have been for such a mundane story, but it's been in my mind for months. I don't want to bring this back up with L, but the one or two times I asked anyone else that was there, they just reply to me that they didn't hear the start of the conversation, that they don't know if he was angering me on purpose, so I'm not insisting. So this is a bit venty but I really need people to tell me what they think about it. I thank you for your patience if you read this far, and in advance for your honesty.

input: Let me start by saying, I feel very strongly that it is my job as a parent to make sure I am helping my children become a positive contribution to society. 

Back story. My son is 16 when he decides he’s ready to start his driving course. Most of you know, this can be a lengthy process.  But, I was sensing some procrastination.  So, to make sure he was serious, I laid out a plan. Once he had found a part time job, I would help him start and pay for the drivers ed course.  

Now, at this time, I had already found him a job as a farm hand working 8 hrs a month. This was great, but my point was for him to start saving.  This job was literally pocket change. 

In my mind, having the responsibly of a vehicle came with many hidden costs. We gladly pay their insurance, but gas is all them and we split repairs. 

This is where I became the AH... he was so mad at me. He has Aspergers and hates having to interact with strangers. He fought me on this daily, always coming up with an excuse as to why he “couldn’t” work. His big sis helped draft a fantastic resume and we started taking him around town to drop them off. We didn’t have much luck until one night when I was picking up dinner at one of our spots and I hit the owner up. She told me to send my son in and hired him on the spot the next day.   

I was true to my word, and we started the drivers ed process immediately. But, he still brings it up regularly!? How ridiculous it was for me to set such expectations for him. The truth is, he’s not my last, and It will be the standard from now on.

My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

Am I the asshole for wanting to wear the shirt I made just once?

Now complete the following example-
input: So, I met my friend (I’ll call her Eli) through one of my classmates who said that we share a lot of interests (Anime, games, music, similar humour etc) and that we could get along well. I’m always up for new friends so I said i’d love to meet her. I meet Eli one day as she was waiting for my classmate outside school, we introduced ourselves but we had to leave shortly after. 

So I manage to find her insta, we chat and have a great time. After probably a week I ask my best friend why Eli’s name sounded so familiar, because I think I heard something about her having an illness. Well it turns out that she had had leukemia for about 2 years (four years now) and that the prognosis wasn’t getting any better. I kinda went ”huh” and kept talking to Eli.

We kept chatting for about a year and we managed to meet a handful of times, and i slowly get to know more about her. So you might think it’s normal that i don’t feel much for a person i had talked to a few times, which i understand, but i have known her for almost 2 years and i absolutely adore her. I think about her often and the things she says can make me blush and giggle for an hour. She is the funniest person I know and I love her to bits but... even when she gets rushed to the ER because of a fever or when she gers a surprise operation, i feel nothing. I like her so much yet it feels like I would feel indifferent if she died or not, and now even when i consider her to be one of my best friends, when she says that her tumors 20+ are growing way to fast i feel.... empty.

Now these feelings don’t change the way I act around her, I support and reassure her when nobody else can and I treasure her so much. I make her laugh when she is terrified of her next surgery, and calm her down when she enters her depressive state. Even though the dark part of my brain says that I wouldn’t change even if the operation goes south. 

So I need to ask, am I crazy? A bad friend? Or I guess most importantly, AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: My dad is an honest, hardworking guy, but has always been financially unstable, running his own business with employees. I'm 27 (only child) and he has never asked me for help until now.

Last week he called me very upset and told me that he only had $300 in his account and needed help to pay bills. (He also has no CC because of his credit, so this is his only money). He asked for $2000–$3000. With that little in his account obviously I wanted him to pay his bills and also be able to eat, get gas, etc. I sent him a check for $2500 and figured after this hurdle was out of the way, we could figure out a long term plan.

Tonight we spoke again and he told me he went to his CPA and realized he actually has $4500. He seemed to think now everything is ok, but still needed my check to pay his employees and get more established. I asked him, if he has access to his bank account, how did he not realize this was the case? He said that his administrative employee told him he only had $300 and wouldn't be able to pay his employees, just to be mean to him.

You'll have to take my word that he's an honest guy, just clueless and naive. I don't think he was trying to trick me, but I feel that the situation is unfair to me because I gave him that money under the belief that he wouldn't be able to pay his mortgage or eat without it. With the money that he has, I could provide a smaller amount or help him figure out a better long-term plan.

The check is still in the mail to him. WIBTA I asked him not to cash the check and canceled it? I would obviously give him a heads up about it first.

Now complete the following example-
input: I have two roommates. They're friends. They go to the same college. We are NOT friends. I don't like them because I feel left out by them (I tried to be their friend and ask lots of questions, but they never return the favor), I feel that they're pretty judgmental, I don't like that they're strong Christians and pushed it heavily on me in the past.

And I resent the fact that one of them, I call him Billy, well Billy's grandpa owns the apartment building so Billy does not pay rent. He only pays part of the electric/internet bill.

Billy sends lots of text messages complaining. I feel targeted by Billy. He does this thing where he sends a whole long text with lots of guilt trip and passive aggression about one simple thing such as me leaving a glass on the table. 

Because Billy doesn't even pay rent and because he was rude to me, I feel like he doesn't get to tell me shit. I am very tired of Billy and the other guy bossing me around, but acting like best friends. 

They also told me they aren't comfortable with my girlfriend staying over because Billy's grandpa wouldn't like it. Fuck that.

I should be able to have my girlfriend stay, I'm tired of only inviting her when my roommates aren't there. I live there too.

I'll admit, I did screw up once. I smoked weed in the apartment which they don't like and I rolled joints on top of Billy's textbook and forgot about it. He was pretty mad when he found it on the couch. I apologized and we worked it out. 

So. I decided that I'll just avoid contact with them. I know we live together, but at least we don't see each other much. I decided I'll just let my girlfriend stay when we want to and it does not matter what they think. I won't go out of my way to be shitty but I refuse to do what they say anymore, and they can deal with it.

AITA for standing up for myself or are my roommates assholes? I'm genuinely asking. My girlfriend says I'm doing the right thing, my mom says I'm being too harsh and kind of a douche.

Now complete the following example-
input: Sorry for formatting, grammar, etc. I’m on mobile, yada yada yada. 

So last night my sister got into a car wreck, (her fault, no one was hurt seriously besides bruises and being sore.) She was freaking out because the both of us work CNA jobs which don’t make very much, while also in school for medical professions. She would start her program a year ahead of me, but it’s very hard to work during either programs so both of us would have to be PRN or not work at all. Some people work while doing it but it’s insanely hard and stressful, especially since you have to have a certain grade point average throughout otherwise you get dropped from the program. 

Last night, she was talking about having to push back starting the program so she could work and pay her car note, car insurance, etc. She had already pushed it back a year before that, and I didn’t want that. I told her to not worry about it, I’ll pay her note and insurance. I’ll work, and I was going to push back my school and my plans for life. 

She immediately began looking at cars online, cars well over 10k. My grandfather is coming to pay for the down payment for a car Thursday, which he doesn’t have the money to really do. He had said before that he would help me pay for my transmission to be fixed, not the entire thing since I didn’t want him paying that much money, but now I can’t ask him for any money. The guilt is weighing on me even having him pay my sisters down payment. 

I was planning on buying my own car because the transmission on my old car is about to go out, and wanted to move in with my boyfriend later on this year. My mom is controlling, beyond so, and doesn’t help pay for very much. She’s never truly had much money, and what money she gets she blows easily. We now live with my cousins while my sister and I share a tiny bedroom, and she pays less here than when we were in an apartment. I’ve been unemployed and just now starting to work again, the entire time I was unemployed my sister payed for everything I needed. Bills, paying for clothes, groceries etc. 

I had a talk with my boyfriend, and I don’t want to pay her car note. I want to move out, I want to go to school, I want to get a car that doesn’t shake and the engine doesn’t scare me that it’s going to fall apart every time I drive it. I came home and told my mom this, and she told me “It doesn’t work that way. You said you would pay it last night, you don’t have a choice.” 

So I’m sitting in the bathroom, trying to cry as quietly as possible while texting my boyfriend. AITA or would I be if I didn’t pay the car note for her new car?

Now complete the following example-
input: This was fourth of July, last year (17 months ago) when I was at a party with my girlfriend and her friends. One of which, was a MTF transgender (Pre-Op, 6 Months hormones), and dating her another one of her friends. This was the first or second time I met her friends, and I didn't know the proper protocol for pronouns with Transgender people. That being said, I made sure to use the They/Them/Theirs pronouns for the party. I thought everything went perfect up until about a month later. Apparently I had ""Aggressively Misgendered"" this individual during the party, which I found odd because I barely spoke to them and was not aware of any hostile actions or ill intentions the whole day. The only time that I can think of it happening was when we were playing a video game, and I used the ambiguous, ""Get him"" and ""great hit dude"" that I would use regardless of Gender. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do concede that I should have asked the individual which pronouns they prefer and attempted to follow their preference, however I was also never corrected and was instead ostracized from the rest of her friend group.

&amp;#x200B;

Now complete the following example-
input: Backstory: 

Me and her (let's call her ""X"") grew up in the same neighborhood but only become close and subsequently best friends  about 4ish years ago. About April last year she moved upstate  (about 7 hours away) to live with her boyfriend. Since then, whenever we've been able we've met up and hung out and it's always been the best.

&amp;#x200B;

More recently however, I've been diagnosed with depression and sometimes I get sad and need my friend. I'm not the kind of person to be needy or dump my shit on other people so it's only usually when I could use cheering up that I call her and we talk about random things and try and make each other laugh.

&amp;#x200B;

About 4 weeks ago, my sister was rushed into ICU and I was feeling low. I simply messaged X ""Just so you know \[sister\] is in hospital and I'm feeling really low"" and I sent her a photo of my sister in hospital too (as X knows her). X left me on seen and so I left it a few days, until I texted her ""What's going on?"" and this time she didn't leave me on seen, but had clearly been online but just wasn't responding to me. I had other priorities so I didn't think much of it except that it was pretty shitty of X. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last week I finally messaged her ""Can you let me know whats going on?"" and she explained that the photo was uncalled for and she didn't know how to react. I admit that, that was pretty shitty of me to send a traumatic image without any warning or anything. She then explained how she felt really bad for not being able to get back to  me because it upset her so much. We managed to talk it all through and we were back to normal(ish) again.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, my depression was being really bad again and all I wanted was to talk to my friend, but I became afraid that she'd just ignore me again or whatever, or maybe she just doesn't want to know... So  feeling insecure I messaged her ""I'm sorry if this is difficult to say, but where are we? I mean,  we used to come to each other with everything, but  now  I'm scared that will make you uncomfortable  and things and I don't want that to destroy us, so can you please let me know where I stand?""

&amp;#x200B;

She responded ""??"" 

I first put ""I don't want to ever make you feel bad, but depression can make me feel really low at times"" followed by ""Look, sometimes when I'm sad you ignore me, and I get it, you need space sometimes, but are we the kind of friends who can tell each other bad things, or are we only the kind of friends that  just make each other laugh?""

She responded ""It's weird to define friendships like this""

So I said ""I'm not trying to define our friendship, I just don't  want to break any boundaries or do anything that could destroy us. So I'm asking X, where do we stand, can I tell you when I'm low or not?""

She  blocked me...

&amp;#x200B;

So kind people of reddit, AITA?

input: Some backstory: My sister has three children. She is 31 years old. Her oldest son is turning 10 this year, her middle son is 4, and her daughter is 2. She does not have any form of custody of her children.

My sister has relapsed, again. She is an addict. She smoked weed and cigarettes the entirety of her first pregnancy. Her second, she added cocaine. And, her last, she added heroin. Since her last baby, she has been arrested, sent to rehab, run away from rehab, and has been relapsing. She has not spent more than 500 days total with any of her children. 

Her children all call her Momma and dote on her. But, her oldest is about at the age where he's starting to notice his mom only cares about partying. She comes into the kids' lives sporadically, and she can't stay sober, even when they're visiting. 

Would I be the asshole if I told her she needs to waive her parental rights unless she can get her shit together? She has already had her custody rights stripped by the court system,  as she failed multiple drug tests over the year after her daughter was born. While I know she loves her kids, I just don't think it's fair to her children to have a mom who cares more about getting high than them.

Now complete the following example-
input: First post: feel free to ask for more info if needed. 

We have been together since we were 18 and 20. Regarding sexual partners, He doesnt keep count but it is significantly more than my partners. I can count the partners I have had on one hand. The penetration is what I have to feel safe about and that is rare with someone I just met.

About five years ago, we dabbled in the swinger lifestyle. He said I brought it up back then but I don't remember ever saying it and aside from a little liquid courage or trying to appease him, I've never entered into these relationships on my own. Even after his not-so-subtle push for me to be a hot wife or a cam girl. He regularly encourages me to go get drunk and go home with someone, claiming he just wants to share me. I've never done it, because I don't want to. He insists I just won't admit I want to sleep with other people or get out of my comfort zone.

I was molested as a child. During the early phases of our relationship and exploring intimacy, I even had breakdowns about conflicting feelings of being sexually touched and allowing myself to let it feel ""okay"". He knows my past. 

He is a fantastic lover. He has studied my body and strives to give me so many orgasms, I lose count. Amazing! 10/10

However, he has also put hidden cameras in our bedroom, more than once, after I made it  clear how it made me feel. One time, I did try to allow it to satisfy him but I hated being watched. He has coached me via text to mastubate and such while watching me, on a camera, I didn't know existed. 

We recently started couples therapy. I've been in therapy myself about two months longer than our couple sessions, different therapist of course. 

Therapy seems to be going well and sometimes he can see my perspective but he recently asked me if we will ever have sex like we did, meaning allowing him to use all sorts of toys on me. I don't always enjoy it. I usually don't ask for it. When he asks and I decline he sighs and shows obvious disappointment. I'm processing a lot of my own trauma including the deceit I feel about the cameras and have only been willing to use toys a handful of times in the last 3 months or so. 

AITA for telling him that I like the sex we have without all the toys, restraints and additional partners? At least until I can process everything and feel safe again?

It's my body and I certainly can't predict when I'll suddenly feel like I'm trapped and being abused again but I'm trying to learn how to process and let it go. I'm trying to stay in my ""safe zone"" and proposed I do still enjoy it sometimes but I want to be the one to ask to do toys, etc because then I actually do want it versus him asking and me feeling guilted to oblige or having to tell him no and him being visibly disappointed. 

Hopefully, I was clear. Thanks, reddit friends.

input: So I am going back to my home country (third world) for a holiday soon and I’ve already told my parents and grandparents how much money I plan on spending whilst there. 

My mum and nan seemed to be okay with the amount but as soon as I’d told my dad and grandad (living back home), they told me that it might not be sufficient because I wouldn’t have enough money to spend for fun and leisure and I think they are under the impression that I would be giving each and every one of my extended relatives some sort of amount. 

I, for one, didn’t plan on giving EVERYONE any since I’ve got quite a few from both sides. It’s only just me going there as well, and I wanted to go there to unwind and enjoy myself. I might give some of my close relatives a little bit but that would soon add up. 

When my dad told both my mum and I that it wouldn’t be enough, I told him “well it’s not my responsibility to give them money.” He just looked at me sternly after that but didn’t say a word.

Now complete the following example-
input: For some context:  My cousins are hosting an anniversary party.  They live some 700kms away from the hometown where my family grew up and where many still live.  I live a couple hundred kms North of that hometown.

When we first heard about the party at thanksgiving (in October), the hometown family started floating the idea to rent a charter bus from the hometown to the party.  I quickly looked at Google Maps, and saw that it would add only 26kms and only 46 minutes to swing through my city on the way instead of taking the typical route.  It would save me, however, two and half hours driving each way from where I live to meet the bus in the hometown.  (Also, to drive from where we live to the party would be 5.5 hours and just under 600km each way, or $85.17 in gas round trip, according to a road trip calculator website.)  My cousin, Brooke, who was organizing the bus immediately shot down the idea at dinner.  I initially said, if it can come through our town, we're definitely in.

The price to participate was set at $100/adult and kids were free.  Immediately, I was put off.  That would be $200 for me and my husband with no kids (which is a lot of money for us, we don't have a lot of extra room in our budget), and $200 for my cousin's family with 4 kids.  It started to seem like a really good deal for the families with kids: now they wouldn't have to drive their big vehicles that hold all their kids, their kids would have other kids to play with, there would be movies to distract them, a toilet so they didn't have to stop, and it was becoming a ""booze cruise"" so the parents could drink on the way.

We felt a lot of pressure to participate though, because family's important, so we committed to the idea.  Last time it was confirmed was Oct 26, and I was told they were *not* going to go through my city.  I said we would come anyway, knowing it wasn't the best financial choice for us, but that it would be an experience.

Since then, though, apparently a lot of other people from the hometown have backed out.  Yesterday, I was talking to my aunt, Allison, and she said that the price might be $140/adult now!  So, now we're paying $280 to drive 5 hours out of our way to catch a bus that we didn't really want to take in the first place, and we were never told that all these people were backing out.  And, the people organizing don't want to leave the town where the party is until 9:30am local time Sunday, which is 10:30am in our province, which means that my husband and I likely won't get home until 10pm our time on Sunday, and we both have to work Monday morning.  The cousin organizing was asked by someone else if we could leave earlier Sunday morning, but she said 9:30 was early enough.  I don't get that, even if you're tired and hungover, you're going to be on a bus for 8 hours - sleep then!

I started to feel sick about the cost and about how it was never even considered to come pick us up.  Especially when I learned that the bus does not charge by the km, but by the hour.  So, if we arrived at the party town 45 minutes later (right now they're planning on arriving extra early so the kids can swim in the hotel pool before the party), and left 45 minutes earlier Sunday morning, the bus would be rented for the same amount of time, cost the same, but save my husband and me a lot of time. 

So, I called my aunt back and expressed my concerns that it was getting too expensive.  Suddenly, she said, it wasn't going to cost $140 (which sucks, according to her), only $100 still.  And I told her that I was disappointed that the idea to drive through our city was never taken seriously (remember, it was rejected immediately by my cousin when I asked earlier).  My aunt said that the bus driver refused to drive to our city for only two people because then it wouldn't be a divided highway like the other route, and he didn't like that.  That's the reality of our province, there aren't always divided highways.  And, the bus companies in this province drive hockey players and miners everywhere without divided highways all the time, this is not out of the ordinary.  I told her still, we couldn't go on the bus, and she told me we would still have to pay our $100 each, which I think is crap.  She said everyone who backed out did so before the bus was officially booked 10 days ago.  I'm annoyed that I didn't get told 10 days ago that so many people were bailing and it was becoming more expensive.  

Anyway, I told them I wouldn't be on the bus, to count me out, and hung up the phone and went to bed feeling sad and guilty - she was really pressuring me on the phone.  She was saying things like, ""If it were me, I would just come and have all the fun this weekend is going to be and then live conservatively next weekend and the next weekend and the next until January or February or whatever it took to make up the time and money!"" and ""As if you need to be home so much on the weekend, you probably spend most of the time in your bathrobe lounging around anyway!""  It's the holidays, money is tight, time is tight, we have to be careful with what we do.  And, we don't laze around all weekend, we are in our early 30s but we don't party a lot.  We try to take care of ourselves and our house on weekends.

I wake up to a voicemail on my phone; I check it, and it's from my aunt.  She's now saying, if it makes a difference, that they could pick us up in a small town 80kms South of where I live.  And they hope that will change our minds and make us come.  The thing is, that makes the bus take single lane highways!  But, I thought the bus refused to drive single lane highways?  Looking at Google maps, this new route they're offering is the one suggested by Google Maps, and is actually shorter in kms and time than the divided highway route they were going to take.  

So, I feel like the whole thing was being organized to work best for this one branch of the family, and my husband and I were going out of our way (literally and figuratively) to help keep the cost of this trip down for that branch, when no considerations would be made to help us out.  I don't want to pay the $200 to contribute to the bus costs, I think that's unfair, but my aunt made it sound like I don't have a choice.  When I said we couldn't take the bus, she just said, ""Oh, you're just going to pay $200 for nothing?  That sucks for you guys!""

The bus was never the economical choice for us, but it was going to be where a lot of our family members were and was going to be part of the experience.  Now, though, it's mostly just that one aunt and her family, and they have a lot of kids, and we just feel like it's not fair that they booked this expensive bus knowing so few people were going.  And is our $200 really the tipping point for them?  Was it just us keeping the bus a go?  

So, am I the asshole for refusing to pay the $200 for this bus trip?  Am I the asshole for still refusing to go, even with this modified route they offered?

Now complete the following example-
input: Some context here; my younger sister (21) recently came home from a 6 month work placement abroad. She has a lot of stories about her time there (understandable) but really talks about nothing else but that, at any given opportunity 

A few weeks ago we decided to watch a film altogether as a family. It was quite an emotional and dramatic film about a man suffering from depression (it's Manchester by the sea for anyone who's seen it). In the middle of quite a pivotal and poignant scene, my sister asks me to pause it, in a way that suggests it's something urgent. This wasn't at a scene change or even at a pause for a drink etc, but smack bang in the middle of an important scene.

""MARIA'S CAT has died!"" 

Now it turns out this is someone who she barely knew abroad, and I hadn't even heard mentioned before. Also,our family are not cat or even animal people:. I clearly don't want harm brought to them but in all seriousness I don't care about someone I've never met and their old cat dying.

I was quite annoyed that she'd interrupted this emotional scene. If it'd been a crappy comedy or she'd waited until a proper break, it wouldn't have wound me up, but this isn't the first time she's done this. She sometimes will just  start playing  videos on her phone with the sound on during  films and her usual excuse is ""well, I'm not watching properly anyway"" as if that's a justification? I had a bit of a go at her, saying ""could that not have waited?"" to which she got annoyed and said I didn't care about anything but whatever I'm focussed on. I argued it was ruder to stop a film to announce a minor acquaintance's pet dying.

My dad didn't fully take sides but said I was quite mean about it, but I think my point stands and that it's a case of picking your moments of when to announce things like that.

So, AITA?

Because of this I told my gf that I wanted a break from sex for 1 month in order to focus all my energy and effort into studying for my hard finance and accounting courses. I said we still can do 1 date night every 2 weeks for this month as opposed to 1-2 times a week how it is normally. She was ok with the date night thing but super pissed about me limiting her on the sex for one month. The thing is sex with her is so tiring for both of us, we usually go 2-3 times a day 4-5 days a week. And I'm so exhausted after a day of that, I'll never be able to study effectively. She said I'm denying her sex which is super shitty and a terrible thing to do and that I'm an ass clown. She has multiple dildo's vibrators etc to keep her satisfied so I just think 1 month for my future is not a big deal.

input:     So basically, we have a 4day road trip (I, wife and 3yo daughter). Original plan was to commute but taking into account the cost and comfort of travel, we decided to take our car. We were planning the itinerary when we started discussing about buying an inflatable car bed and somehow it turned into a debate wether to bring the carseat or not which is a no-brainer IMO. 
     As far as i know, it's not illegal in our country(philippines) to have your child seated at the back with only a seatbelt on. She says she can't sleep in the backseat if we were to use the carseat. I argued that she would take our daughter's safety for granted and trade it for a nap. Argument goes on a while and I told her it's either our daughter seats on a carseat during the trip or no trip at all. AITA?

Emphasis that here in the Phil., we are no bound by law to use a carseat and it is not what we people are not generally accustomed to, though it is frowned upon by some.

Hello all M28, I just broke it off with my SO F25. I was in a relationship for 3 years... exactly 3 on Wednesday the 12th... My SO suffered from a very advanced case of anxiety and depression. At first I was very accommodating and I was able to calm her and help her through her struggles. After the first year she lost her mom in an accident and I was there for her every step of the way. After that event she changed pretty significantly. Her condition escalated to violent outbursts, getting upset over nothing and she even gave me a black eye. 1 year after her moms passing I let her know that she needs help and her depression was now dragging me down. (I am a veteran of OIF and OEF, diagnosed with PTSD and struggling in my own way). I said this cannot continue unless she seeks help. She promised she would, but that never materialized. 6 months later I was getting so depressed that I would avoid her and whenever she came home from work it was causing my heart to race like a flashback... it was unhealthy and unfair. I started seeing a therapist from the VA to talk about all of this as well as my way of coping. I care so deeply about her but I had to walk away for my own health. It was effecting my work, friends, and sanity. I am not an expert on depression and I suffer from it as well, but I apologize if I offend anyone by not caring enough or giving it my all because I really did...

So AITA?

I've tried to post this several times, but it's gone through weird

To give you an idea of how much this is, my first attempt at writing this was about 7500 words. I'll keep it brief. I got into a fight with this guy on PlayStation. Everyone (in the party) agrees he has an ego problem. I'm pretty sure I have one to, but it's not near as extreme as this other guy. I've had a friend swayed over to playing for honor (a notoriously toxic game) with a notoriously toxic person, while being of a notoriously toxic age. I've known this friend for a while, so me being torn from him by these people was a bit crushing. After I'd been kicked from one too many parties (me and the rude guy had arguments constantly and, because he has no confidence, he kicks when he's routed) I got into an argument with my friend about it and he ended up blocking me on 2 separate platforms. I plan on trying to be friends with him later, during the next marching band season at my school, I think because he's a freshman and I wasn't the most stable guy around at the time, we'll be better suited to being around each other when we both become more mature. I was told the group I'd left had bonded through their hatred of me, and that the annoying coward leader is still shouting commands to this day. Sorry if this isn't conveyed correctly, or if it needs info, my 7000+ word version covered everything in extreme detail, and if you guys want, I'll post it in a Google doc and share the link. Thank you.

End of original post, I can fit more detail

My and the guy I've argued with do argue way too much, so I try to stop, but I get angry easily and prepetuate it

Almost everyone has a problem with the guy I argue with, but he's a high rep in for honor so they respect him

I've occasionally had problems with my friend before, but he's much better than he used to be, and I still need to grow

I have completely shut off contact with the party, except for 2 people (the friend and someone else who's calm)

I am trying my hardest to not cause conflicts and to leave that group alone.

Let me know if I need more detail. Thanks.

input: I’m currently on a flight to Toronto, and of course i’m seated right in front of children. The second I get seated, the kid behind me starts kicking my seat very frequently and hard enough for me to feel it and be annoyed. This kid is also humming very loudly ( I can hear it with my headphones in). So I turn around and say “ Can you please stop kicking my chair and humming, it’s very annoying”. The kid immediately gets sad and the dad gets angry with me. Now I feel like an asshole. So, AITA?

input: My cousin and her ex are both 26 and had been dating for about 5 years. He recently broke up with her and me and him started messaging each other and secretly meeting up. I’m 19 but tbh ive had a crush on him since they first got together when I was like 14. We both got along really well and I’d always joke around with him but obviously at the time he didn’t look at me like that,He did say he thought it was obvious that I had a little crush on him and he found it cute. Anyway as I got older we both started to feel chemistry between us. We never did anything though because he was with my cousin. 

We want to be together although we know it’s gonna be pretty awkward for a while if we do get together. Is it really bad of me to date him?

The problem is that I have bought wine every week, there have been about 3 times I remember not being in charge of the alcohol. Someone brings snacks about once a month but I very much like being tipsy while dealing with our chaotic evil rouge who's 12 aparently(the character not the player).

I love this group but buying 2 bottles of semi-nice wine once a week is a little much for my budget right now. Last game I bought 2 bottles of wine for $5 and one of the other players complained that it tasted like cooking wine. Trying to be diplomatic I suggested she bring her own wine because I think I'm going to keep buying this one for a while. Am I the asshole here?

input: Right after the midterm elections, one of my second cousins shared a post about how a certain gubernatorial election was unfair because the winning candidate won even though the other candidate won more districts (the districts in question are, obviously, way less populated than the ones that voted for the winner), and how gubernatorial candidates should have to win both the popular vote and some sort of geographical vote. I commented on the post saying that the winning candidate won by a clear majority, it would be unfair for people's votes to count differently based on how dense the area they lived in is, and that I would support the popular vote no matter which candidate won. She proceeded to go into a rant about how I, unprovoked, shared my opinions even though she hadn't shared hers, and that I was being self righteous and a sore winner about it.  She said all this sarcastic stuff about ""what would we do without the educated city folk educating us."" She implied that I called her an ""idiot Republican,"" when I did no such thing - I was perfectly respectful, no personal attacks, no political attacks, just sharing my opinion on the matter.

She then unfriended me, which I'm not upset about, she's barely in my life as it is and I see no reason for her to be in it moving forward. AITA for commenting my (disagreeing) opinion on a political post?

input: We (2 F) just got a new housemate a few days ago and I'm already wishing we hadn't chosen him. 

So, we have a 10 month old baby who crawls everywhere and has her fingers in everything. Our new housemate, G, is a super lovely guy but A. He doesn't wash his hands after going to the toilet (something I've tried hinting at to avoid addressing it directly) and B. He spent 45 minutes in the bathroom trimming goodness knows what hair on his body (I saw him doing his belly &amp; later he closed the door which can only mean pubes, right..?). I left before he finished, and when I got back (He wasn't in) I wanted to do the baby night routine when I found his hair everywhere!! On toothbrushes, contact lens cases, mouth guard etc. When I saw loads floating in baby's bath, I lost it and texted him. I was frank but nice (I asked a friend). While I was at it I mentioned the hand washing. He is also a smoker despite us clearly stating non-smokers only. (He told me he assumed outside is ok. No, it's not, man!) I THINK he now vapes in his room (which I'm not happy about) but he says it's without the nicotine. Either way, his room smells stuffy already. (It drafts into the hall.) Oh, and I also went on a cleaning spree after this and I found parts of the toilet full of pee spray. I'm seriously grossed out. But he is a nice lad! (I haven't talked to him yet because he's still not home but I intend to in the morning. I talked to him about the smoking and he said ""I'll stop. Dont worry."" But I know from someone who saw him the next day that he had a cigarette.)

Anyway, WIBTA if I give him his notice already? Would that be unfair? Or should I give him a chance and see if he betters himself?

Maybe what he is saying is true, i don’t even know if it is, but I’m sure there are more reasons to why women may not have chosen engineering than just not liking it.

input: This is on mobile so please forgive formatting issues.

A few months ago I went from a very active job to a desk job and put on a little weight. I haven't been really happy with this so a few weeks ago I started going to a gym and meeting with a personal trainer.

It was going great until the gym changed its rules on how many clients a personal trainer had to take to train at this gym. From what I've heard it's hard for them to keep up and there is no shortage of people wanting to work with trainers, hence why they have become more demanding with numbers.

The issue I'm having is I pay for one on one training with G. It's been going really well and I am losing weight but after the gym changed it's rules, she is double booking/triple booking her time slots. My time slot is a popular one and so for 3 sessions now I have had to work out with 2 older women (late 50's early 60's) who simply cannot keep up with someone who's 21. I feel like I'm losing momentum in my work out as I spend a lot of time standing around waiting for them. I have asked G to move me on without them but she refuses because she doesn't want to explain the same thing twice.

WIBTA if I asked G to not double book my time slot and/or book me with someone more my speed? WIBTA if I went to the gym and asked for a different trainer if she refuses?

Td;lr WIBTA for not wanting to share my one on one time with a personal trainer with older woman who can't keep up with me?

Now complete the following example-
input: I am currently a freshman in university and have been having a pretty bad time here.  Most of my floor hates me because I called a girl out on accusing me of touching her and trying to call campus security on me when I didn't even touch her, and she just ran into me.  While that was a whole other conflict, essentially most people on the floor sided with this girl and most of my floor hates me, and to be honest I don't really care.  One guy who does still treat me with respect is my roommate, who opted to stay out of the conflict and not take sides.

I thought that he treated me with respect at least.  Earlier today, me and a couple of friends were playing Smash ultimate on his switch, and we were doing a tourney battle.  I won several games as Corrin, but when I claimed I was undefeated the other 3 people we were playing with claimed that I had lost one game to one of them, even though I absolutely am sure that I did not- I even took notes on my winrates and was sure that I had a 100% wr on Corrin.  Long story short, we argue for a while and two of them bet me money that I couldn't prove my winrate as Corrin.  After a heated argument back and forth, my roommate childishly claimed that he won the argument and said that I should just ""hf with your shitty memory.""  I took great offense to this- firstly, i thought that he was my friend, and secondly, I know that I have a good memory (I generally score high on memorization exams and have even won a national geography bee).  So, I just said ""At least I have a good enough memory to remember my best friend's girlfriend.""  I said this because my roommate told me that he had a boy and a girl best friend in high school who were dating, and during a party he kissed the girl, and ever since the three of them haven't been friends.  He got really mad at me for this, even though he clearly did very shitty thing to do to his best friend at that party.  He even said that ""I can't even remember who my own girlfriend is"" and accused me of cheating on her.  I have a girlfriend in high school who is a senior, but because of the distance, in the first few months of college I got a couple of handjobs from other girls around the school.  But, this was only because I was really drunk and also I really regretted it and even told my girlfriend about it, who forgave me.  My girlfriend was okay with it and I was barely in control of what I was doing, so I hated the fact that he suggested that this was actually cheating (I never even had sex with the girls).  

Am I the Asshole for calling my friend out on his shitty behavior to his supposed ""best friend"" from high school?

Now complete the following example-
input: So two nights ago I matched with a girl who seemed pretty cute. We sent maybe three to four messages in total but they were pretty deep from the outset since she opened with a question about what I liked about my personality. Overall I could tell she was pretty smart and part of me wanted to end up trying to see where things but part of me was also hesitant. I was hesitant because I apparently hadn't realized that she had kids when I originally came across her profile. At this point in my life (I'm 27/M) I don't think I'd be ready to have kids or take on the responsibility of dating someone who has kids. I was considering the possibility of trying it out until I came to the conclusion that since I'm not too sure about it, I probably shouldn't go for it since I would be entering a dynamic that might cause more harm than good. As for why I matched with her, some days I'm in the bad habit of just swiping off the first picture or so and then other times I actually take the time to read all the way through a profile. I know this is a bad habit and after this I don't think I'll ever do it again. Anyways, AITA for just straight up unmatching her yesterday morning without telling her my reasoning? We had only sent in total like 4-5 messages each but I feel like a jerk for not saying why we unmatched. Maybe I'm over thinking things but part of me wants to message her on facebook and apologize since I know how it feels to match with someone and then get unmatched. But also I don't know if telling someone ""hey I'm sorry I matched with you, but the reason I did was because I don't think I'm ready for kids"" especially after I've already done the deed would be a good idea either.

Now complete the following example-
input:  I am friends with both M27 and F26. And I am pretty close with them. With F26, not so much anymore. They have been dating since Sophomore year of high school and have known them since. They are engaged for about a year now and getting married in 3 months. 

She is very manipulative and my friend is heavily influenced by her philosophies. He has become a completely different person over time, and has expressed notions and opinions that are definitely not coming from him. 

If he wants to hang out with the guys, it’s her say and 90% of the time she says no. We are his closest friends and rarely see each other. Time spent is usually just catching up over dinner and is a very wholesome time together. 

The rare dinner happened where she showed up. She mentions that he is “way more talkative than usual”. A few weeks after, in an attempt to try to make our group closer with her, we attend her birthday and played board games.  Our friend is like a completely different person. He is clearly putting on a facade and wouldn’t make the jokes he would usually make or say things he usually says. He never laughs either.

Whenever I call, you can tell he’s with her when his voice is very quiet and inhibited and it’s always “I’ll call you back”. I even hear her raising her voice at him in the back sometimes. 

She got a job 1.5 hours away from the city and forced him to switch jobs close to her as well. After getting married she wants to buy a house in that area- very quiet small town. 

My friend works in trades and is having a change of heart. He wants to become an entrepeneur and stay in the big city. He doesnt want to live so far from friends and family and wants to pursue it. She completely hates the idea and does not support him. My opinion is that I know she is a very methodical person who goes according to plan. She probably thinks that it is risky and would want him to be safe and keep providing for her at a job he hates. 

The wedding is coming up and I really feel for him.  He’s one of the nicest guys in the world and he deserves so much better. I plan on taking him out for a beer and I’m just going to straight up tell him that he’s makjng the biggest mistake of his life by marrying her. AITA?

input: I'm sitting in one of the middle seats of a plane with a 3-4-3 layout, so a seat in row F. The guy to the right of me, next to the aisle, got to move seats to somewhere else in the plane. Later on, the flight attendant came back to ask me if I wanted to move to the free seat next to the aisle. I said no, because I hate sitting next to the aisle, people bump into your arm or shoulder when you sleep or use phone or laptop. Then the flight attendant gave me a bad attitude saying 'ok fine if you want to be cramped...'

I'm not a big guy, and the woman sitting next to me was also of normal size, obviously we were not cramped. I also didn't notice her ask anyone if I could move seats. 

Now I get that everyone likes their personal space, but am I the asshole for choosing my own comfort over the unwritten rule of leaving as much space between people as possible?

Now complete the following example-
input: This is probably a weird one lol but I actually got some really helpful feedback last time I posted here, so I wanted to try it again. 

I just had a baby on Feb 8th. She came via a scheduled c section and was a little over 3 weeks early. I always planned to breastfeed for at least a month because of the medicine I'm on. It would help keep her from having any withdrawal symptoms, which it did. 

The reason we had to take her early is because I had an umbilical cord aneurysm, which is an extremely rare and dangerous condition, and she was smaller than she should be. She was measuring about 2-3 weeks behind what her gestational age was. So, I had her and she was tiny, 5 pounds 4 ounces, but otherwise healthy. I have tried breastfeeding 3 out of 4 of my kids and I always end up supplementing because I don't make enough milk. With my girl being so small, the Drs recommended supplementing with formula anyways, to help her gain weight. She's a little over a month now and weighs 7 pounds. 

Now here's the thing, I hate breastfeeding. It's time consuming, its uncomfortable, it's sweet and a great bonding experience sometimes when she actually latches on, but she's not great at that likely because of her being premature, so I have to pump. I don't make a lot of milk at all. I make maybe 5 ounces a day. And that's if I pump consistently every couple of hours. Pumping takes about 20 minutes each time. 

So, even though I know breastmilk is better as far as nutrition and all that, I want to quit. I feel like it takes up so much of my day and for very little payoff. I'd rather spend that time with my kids or snuggling my girl. So, would I be an asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: Here's the long version, you are warned.

My sister has been diagnosed with DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) and it is speckled with other fun things like psychosis, anxiety, depression, etc. It's a real hoot. Her condition appeared about 10 years ago. It was never fully diagnosed until recently but we had a whole comorbidity diagnosis for a very long time. She is considered untreatable but has a cocktail of meds to treat some of the other issues like anxiety, sleep, depression, etc. At one point she underwent ECT treatments but it caused more pain and memory issues than it did at treating the illness. She now lives independently (which is a BIG step) and she has a very patient and caring boyfriend who doesn't seem to mind her issues and actually serves as the person she feels most comfortable with and will take the most direction from during her episodes. He lives with her and she has been for the most part very happy with her new independent life with him. This came to great relief for most of us because, to be honest, we have all taken a beating emotionally and mentally for years. After a while it becomes exhausting and we all find ourselves dealing with our own mental health issues as a result of our interactions with her. Nonetheless, we love her and try very hard to be supportive.

Out of everyone in the family, myself and my husband and children, we have gone through some major bullshit with her episodes in the past. To the point of where we had to go through trauma therapy with our kids for a specific experience. In the last 10 years we have all been verbally assaulted by her. She has major hallucinations and disillusions that make her think horrible things about people and she believes it is real and there is no convincing her otherwise. She has also been a very loving and sweet person who cares dearly about us and those around her. You just never know what person you are dealing with and when.

We have made great attempts to being understanding and supportive, even in light of past transgression. My husband began to see some correlation recently that indicated she had some control over her actions but was selective of when she wanted to control herself. I did not see this but my husband saw her illness before I did and so I think I am just blind to a lot of it and how she works.

Over the weekend I chose to have her, her boyfriend, my father and his wife all over for a Christmas dinner. It is not our entire family because my sister does not take to that very well and she is recently very close to our father (which she wasn't about a year ago) so I thought that would be the most comfortable for her. I anticipated some stress and issues but was not prepared for what was coming at me. Most of the night was okay. She had some minor disruptions and asked me why I had an attitude. I didn't but it is common for her to imagine things like this and convince herself of such. So our night continued and then came the sudden halt to the evening's festivities.

My sister, who as far as I know has no interest, care or political leaning, has been apparently immersing herself in TV, specifically FOX news. My father, pro-Trump and proud Republican, immediately begins steering us into the topic of politics for the after dinner chat. I personally don't mind discussing politics because my family is pretty open and non-hating in regards to everyone's politics. My sister however took off in a direction that she made sure I was aware she directed her outrage regarding the topic towards me. My father, Mr. Instigator, knew he fucked up and I don't blame him but I certainly feel like he knew more than me in regards to her politics. 

My sister starts her tear by declaring she was raised ""in little Mexico with THOSE people"". First off, she was raised in a nice suburban to a middle to high income family and went to school with a few Hispanic individuals whom she was friends with growing up. Her entire life is basically the epitome of white privilege. She has never experienced anything, not homelessness, hunger, thirst, cold, or a lack of health insurance. She has had everything her heart desires. She is WELL taken care of and her family supports her even when they sometimes should really walk away. 

My sister, in her moment of declaring herself a victim of Hispanics (which pissed me off), hissed and sneered at me for my support of rapists and murderers. I was shocked because 1) my sister has never expressed racism before 2) my sister would normally feel very protective of people who are victims of bias because she herself is a victim with her mental health problems. I was so pissed because she had the nerve to come into my home, once again, and be a total asshole to me and call me evil and rude, and claimed I had an attitude even before the conversation that erupted into her shit storm. Ultimately she lashed out and then informed everyone she was going home. My dingbat father had her drive them because she was DD since she can't drink at all on her meds. So him and his wife have to go, at least in order to not upset her more or as I was informed direct her rage at them for not coming with her, so the evening comes to its abrupt end.  

Ultimately I was hurt and angry. I worked my ass off to make sure the night was perfect. I spent a TON of money on food and presents and tried to make my sister feel at home. I was just done. I have officially had enough of it. I love her and as much as I want to support her I don't think I can because her ability to knock me down has been getting better and better. I have even taken her side when it came to health of my family and I think my priorities just need to be me and my own family. She is happy where she is in life and I am happy where she is as well. My husband really feels she is using her illness as a crutch when it best serves her and I really hope not but I did get that feeling at my house the other night. She purposely attempted to ruin the night and I do think her motivations were something outside of her illness and more in line with the fact that she didn't like that my father and I had something we enjoyed conversing about. She seem annoyed when he would get into a topic with me and we would start going back and forth. She would find the opportunity to cut me off and start almost showing off with her ideas on the topic. I didn't take it personally and actually did think to excuse it because ""she doesn't know better"", but my husband saw it as something else as if she was vying for our father's attention.

In the end, we ended up continuing the shit storm on text where she laid into me about my non-use of text to have relationship with her and my insistence to call her when she hates talking on the phone. She called me evil and untrustworthy and that because I told her she gave me anxiety that I was somehow stealing her thunder and trying to make my mental health more dire than hers. She said she was done with rude people and my f-ing attitude. My response was snide and I told her that I wasn't the one coming into someone else's house and basically shitting all over them while they cooked me dinner, cleaned up after me and made sure I was safe, healthy, happy, and fed. She deleted me from her only social media account told me to never contact her again. A part of me felt relief. Like I exited the hostage scenario I've been locked inside of for 10 years. I felt a sense of freedom and honestly I felt good about being an asshole back to her and not letting her mental health be the reason I should relent and be all apologies. I know she may never speak to me again, honestly. I know she may very well go into a psychosis and this comes back to haunt us as she devises her weird plot of revenge (she has done that to others). I just want to be separated from it and her now. I also want to hold her accountable instead of just letting her use her crutch for everything when it is obvious she knows better. If she can live independent and be self-efficient, she can also own up to her own bullshit like the rest us.

My gf was talking about how her sister is having a really hard time dating and what guys go for. I was supportive saying that she is a great person and any guy would be lucky to have her.

And she was like be honest is she hot? I wanted to be honest but not make my girl insecure so I said best way I could. I was like she is attractive, she has the whole hot mom/milf vibe going on.

Now complete the following example-
input: I (20f) decided to take a week long trip to Los Angeles. I used to live there for about a year and half and hadn’t been there for about 6 months. So I thought why not go for a visit while I still had the time (I start school in the spring)

I wanted to drive down there (17 hours) only for the fact that I wanted to retrieve the rest of my belongings that have been siting at a relatives house. Otherwise I would have been happy to flown. My car is still in great condition (2013 Toyota Camry 78,000 miles) so I was very confident in my car being able to take me there and back without any problems. I had saved up over a grand for the trip that was entirely funded by me and I had already payed my Airbnb ahead of time. So yes I had money for the trip not anything crazy but it was a fair amount for only a weeks long trip.

Two days before I go I visit my moms house (I live with my father who is currently stationed in Afghanistan) and she is telling me how “stupid” I am for going on this trip alone and driving there alone. Thinking she was just being bitter I shrug off everything she has said and I go anyways.

I go have the time of my life, come back even brought a friend up to stay for a couple days and she leaves. Everything is good I am in one piece my car is fine and I have all my stuff.

I go back to visit my mom today and it’s been about 5 days since I’ve been back. And she’s still bitter about the trip. But on top of her being angry I find out my brother was angry, my aunt and grandma( the relatives that I had my stuff stashed away at) , my father (who called my mother), my other aunt and uncle whom I’m close with. Everyone is calling me stupid for going on this trip and I don’t know why. I’ve been called an asshole and insensitive to their feeling.

I’m not a bad kid, yes I smoke weed and drink occasionally at parties. But I’ve never been in trouble with the law, I always pay my bills, I made sure my cat was being well taken care of while I was gone, and it’s not like a left out of the blue. I had told everyone of my upcoming trip months prior and they had said nothing to me.

So am I missing something? Did I do something wrong?

input: My GF is 6 months pregnant. Before she got pregnant we had sex like at east 5 or 6 times a week, I usually initiated. When she first got pregnant we still maintained our sex life but since she started showing I've kind of been put off having sex for many reasons. 1 is that I kind of feel like awkward having sex with her when there's literally a baby in her stomach. Although I know it technically doesn't hurt the baby it's just weird to think about. 2. I honestly find the stomach a turn off. She always been really thin and fit and since getting pregnant she's gained like a bunch of weight and I'm just not as eager to have sex as we used to.

My GF thinks I'm an asshole and gets angry, like really mad whenever I turn down sex or whenever she sees me masturbate or watch porn. I just can't really help it and I don't get why we can't just wait until after she has the baby.

AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: Ah, I've kinda been thinking about this a bit recently and I kinda feel like an unintentional ass.

Maybe like a week or 2 before prom I was walking into the school from the parking lot when 2 girls started yelling my name and telling them to go over to their car. When I got their and started talking the one girl made me pinky promise with her we would dance together at prom. Considering I can't dance I was a little concerned on how that would play out. 

Anyways, prom rolls around (No, I didn't have a date) and I saw the girl at prom before the food was served, talked a bit then went over to my table. Sometime during the night on the dance floor I randomly made eye contact with her and her friend then quickly looked away and started talking to someone. The reason I never asked her to dance was a mix of awkward/shyness and not knowing/being able to dance. 

Prom ends and I didn't see her again till a week later a party when I randomly run into them and her friend goes ""hey girlsname look who it is."" and pretty much had a short conversation with her on why we didn't dance at prom,(she brought it up) where I said something along the lines of cause I didn't really see her once the dancing started. Ended the convo with her saying she'd talk to me later and that was the last time I talked to her. Well more because summer was right around the corner than University but yeah.

Was I an asshole here?

input: I'm planning a trip with 3 or so friends to go to France in the summer. Now I speak fluent French, although I'm rusty, having done it for 7 years through school (ages 11-18) and using it during my degree for research. 2 of my other friends also speak the language to varying degrees, mostly at a conversational level. 

Now something has cropped up which is bothering me- namely that on a few occasions I've had members of the group openly assume that I'm going to be a translator. On one occasion we were looking up some tourist sites online and some art thing we found was in French only. One of the friends who wanted to go to this was saying ""well that's not a problem, you can translate"", making the assumption that I'd be happy doing this, which I'm not. I said this at the time and it caused something of an argument, with her saying I'm being selfish and me saying that it's more so to simply expect that I'm going to do something without asking. 

 As far as I'm concerned, it's my holiday too and the last thing I want is to be a workhorse, especially when in at least two people's cases they're perfectly capable of working things out for themselves using a phrasebook or simply learning stuff beforehand. Neither is it totally impossible if they're that worried about their language skills, especially with the Internet, that we couldn't find things to do which have the option of using the English language. 

So, WIBTA?

Now complete the following example-
input: This is a throwaway account because she follows my account. I'll give you a little background. 

I bought a two bedroom house about a year ago. I got a super good deal on it because the previous owners put an addition on but did not finish it. The addition would add another master bedroom and bonus room on a 2nd floor. 

I had two roommates moving in with me. I gave them the two existing bedrooms while I lived in the attached garage. I didnt mind because I was going to have the rest of the house done pretty soon. 

I took out a credit card with a special offer for the first 12 months at a suoer low APR. Finished the addition in about 5 weeks. Planned on making the bonus room a game room and living in the new master. By then my sister went on summer break and needed a place to stay and my girlfriend wanted to move in. So I shared the master with my girlfriend and split the game room in half for my sister. After my sister went back to College I turned the game room back into a full game room and stayed in the master with my girlfriend and her daughter. 

But shortly before my sister left my girlfriend lost her job. The company went under, she was not fired. The company that took over wanted her to go to a training facility over an hour away. She tried for a bit but it was too much because it caused her to work 13 hour days and barely see her kid. She quit and I let her stay with me essentially rent free for a couple months while she was in between jobs. 

With her daughter going on 7 we decided she needed her own room and we needed the privacy. So we let the daughter have the master while we took the game room. (If I wanted to use the game room at night I wouldnt disturb her daughter. Thats why we decided this.).

Now that she has a stable job with decent pay I asked her to start paying rent two months ago. She has been at her job for 6 months now. I wasnt exactly having trouble but I was basically living paycheck to paycheck with $20-$50 extra a month. We agreed that she should pay half of all house bills that I am responsible for. Plus we go halves in on food. 

I am one payment away from paying the card off. I have been paying as much as I can each month to get it done with as quick as possible. While she isnt struggling herself, she doesnt have that much wiggle room every pay period. We got into a huge argument last night because I refuse to go down on her rent after my last credit card payment.  She feels that because I make more than her that I should be paying more. I don't see it that way at all. I think that would be really unfair to me. Especially because I don't even get to live in the bedroom I built so her daughter can have her own room. 

Its not my fault you make less than I do. This isnt section 8 housing. So why should I have to pay for more than ""my share"" when I dont even technically have half the space. I think its udder bullshit. We arent engaged. We aren't married. Grow up and pay your way. Does this make me an asshole?

input: My wife and I have been together for 4 years, married for about 6 months. I love her to death, and would not be where I am without her. That being said...

My wife has a terrible habit of using a tissue/Kleenex, stuffing it into her pants or hoodie pocket, and then forgetting to take them out. Whenever I do laundry (I always do it because I am very particular about it), I constantly find shredded tissues dispersed all over the fresh laundry from the dryer. I have asked her politely numerous times (12-15 times at least), but it seems to go in one ear and out the other.

Recently, I decided to take these shredded pieces of tissue and stick them back into her clothing. I will put it in her sleeves, jean pockets, hoods on hoodies, etc. She recently found this out and claims that I am indeed an asshole. I think I have given her well more than enough opportunities to fix her habit.

As I am literally going down the runway, I booked her another ticket that would arrive a few hours after me and sent her confirmation via text. She was mad I left without her.

Now complete the following example-
input: So, my brother has a long history of being an angry, abusive alcoholic. He has physically and verbally abused every girlfriend he has had (4 different women). He has been arrested and has done jail time for this, and was in jail for the last 3 months for his last attack (drunk and choking his girlfriend). He drunkenly punched my ex boyfriend 4 years ago which resulted in this boyfriend having to get surgery on his jaw and eat only soft foods for a month. It was incredibly hard for me to forgive him and be around him after this. He ended up doing jail time for this as well. On top of all of this, he's gotten into multiple drunken fights and drives drunk consistently. 

If he was not my brother, I would never ever want to be around him. He has 2 kids and to be honest, has always been a good dad to them (which is the one thing he has going for him), but I think he's just a horrible role model for them and has put them through a lot being in and out of jail and abusing their mothers. 

After all of this and being increasingly uncomfortable around him the past few years, I have decided I don't want to be around him anymore. I've made this clear to my parents. I've basically stopped asking about him since he's been in jail. I opened Facebook today and saw that he updated his profile picture and one of his friends tagged him in a photo. 

I already planned with my parents that my boyfriend and I would come stay with them for the weekend after Thanksgiving. I'm super excited about it since I haven't spent time with my family in a while (we live 3 hours away). I texted my dad and asked if he my brother had gotten out of jail. He said yes. I asked if he will be there next weekend and he said ""I assume so."" I told him if he is, we aren't coming and I'm sorry. He said he hopes I reconsider and my mom will be completely heartbroken. It upsets me that every time he does something like this it is completely swept under the rug and he is welcomed back with open arms. 

I'm upset because they didn't tell me he was going to be there (likely staying with my parents the whole weekend) but I also feel so awful because I don't want to make my mom sad and I was so looking forward to seeing my family. I don't know how to feel about it. Am I just being a baby? Should I just suck it up and go? I feel like I'm the only one in my family that feels so strongly about it. 

Am I the asshole for cutting ties with him and for not wanting to attend my family Thanksgiving because he will be there?

Now complete the following example-
input: My now ex girlfriend lives with her sister, and I would often spend time with both of them and sometimes just her sister. For the first two years, I was madly in love with my ex and the sister was always supportive. We all got along besides small fights between my ex and I or my ex and her sister. 

However, after year two of dating, I started to notice some problems that my girlfriend and I had. Things like her not being as kind to me as I would have liked or her being very extroverted and me being very introverted. We would frequently have fights revolving around these issues.  Despite these issues, we were still working hard to rise above them and live happily (nothing worth breaking up over).

Now brings me to the meat of the problem. My ex girlfriend's sister was introverted like me and was much kinder to me and all people in general. Granted she had her own problems, but they were issues that never really bothered me. Because of this I saw myself falling for her sister. I still loved my ex at the time, but I couldn't stop my feelings over her sister. I also think it's important to note that I never acted on these feelings besides maybe some mild flirting that I quickly ended when I realized what I was doing.

I tried for multiple months to suppress these feelings and find ways to make me not be in love with her sister. I tried everything I could, but I finally decided I had to end things with my long term girlfriend. She was shocked and angry to say the least. I explained that it was because of the other problems mentioned before (partially true), but I never mentioned her sister. She was very angry with me saying it was abrupt and things were improving. I said how sorry it was, but it just couldn't do it anymore.

I have since cut off all contact with both her and her sister, and I have no plans to try to make a relationship with her sister. So reddit, AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: I’m (24F) in a fairly new relationship with this guy, let’s call him M (23M); we’ve been together for about 3 months. He’s slightly more “traditional” in some ways; he likes to open doors for me, wants me to walk in front of him, etc. (this is relevant). 

We live in a huge city, and it’s extremely common for people to cross the street when the WALK sign is not lit if there are no cars coming, or even if there are cars but they are a block or more away.  I noticed recently that when we’re out together, whenever I try to cross the street like this-- even when other people are also crossing-- his reflex is to snatch my arm and pull me back, as if I were about to run in front of a car. At first, I found it kind of endearing, like “aw, he’s worried about my safety”, and chalked it up to his other “traditional” behaviors, but now I’ve started to dislike it; it startles me, is unnecessary and feels a little insulting, like he doesn’t trust me to handle myself.  I hadn’t said anything until last night because I still felt that his intentions were good.

Cut to last night. We were heading back home after drinking with friends. I was definitely drunk but not blacked out or sloppy; I wasn’t falling over or confused. I started to cross a street that had very slow traffic, but I was not near a car and there were lots of other people crossing. He grabbed me and pulled me back as he usually does, and at that moment, it pissed me off. I didn’t say anything, but I yanked my arm back and continued crossing without him. 

Once we were alone, we got into an argument about it; me giving him attitude by pulling away really hurt him. He said that he was just trying to look out for my safety, it wasn’t just because I was girl and he would have done that with any of his friends, and he thought I was going to run in front of a car because I was drunk. He was mad enough that he said didn’t want to see me for a couple days. 

I apologized and thanked him for looking out for me, and explained how it made me feel. He apologized too, but he’s still unhappy with me.  Reddit what should I do? AITA?

input: I have not purchased from him for the last 6-7 months. I did become friendly with him when I used to buy from him. But our relationship was strictly professional, I paid for exactly what I bought, but on occasions I would pay him in advance and on other occasions I would pay him later.

He called me out of nowhere after 6-7 months, said that he and his dad were arrested, he said he's out but his dad is still locked up and that he needs money to post bail.

The money required is around 10% of my monthly salary. Its around 150 bucks in US dollars. It might feel small to some, but as someone who is living paycheck to paycheck, it is not a small amount for me, but it isn't something I can't manage either.

input: So I’m vegan (yeah, yeah, but it’s relevant). My roommate is on disability (fixed income since she cannot work). She’s bad at managing money so she always runs out in a week, but that’s besides the point. She was talking about wanting to make some chicken so she asked me if I could go pick her up some chicken and I said no. She then told me she’d pay me come payday (end of the month - this happened earlier this week). Again, I still said no. She knows I’m vegan so hi, why would I? She then got mad at me and told me that it’s not like I’m spending my own money as if the issue is the fact that I would have to spend $8 of my own money. It’s about about the money lol

And all of my other roommates are omnivore and chimed in telling me I’m being selfish and “pushing” my lifestyle onto others and that if I’m getting repaid, it’s not really my money buying that chicken (that’s not how economics works but ok). And even though whenever I’m downstairs eating, my roommates mock what I eat (“ew what is that? Where’s the protein? Ha ha, are you protein deficient? Have some of this steak” as I’m eating a meal with 30g of protein), but I’m pushy? Sure, Jan.

Veganism isn’t a diet. It’s a philosophical guideline. I don’t think it’s unreasonable for me to not want to contribute to the exploitation and cruelty of living beings. This occurs often too. she’ll ask me to pick up other animal products like ~~animal secretions~~ milk or sour cream and I’ll offer to buy the non-~~cruelty~~dairy version and I ever offer to pay the difference out of pocket. But god forbid I promote a cruelty-free way of life.

tl;dr: roommate wanted me to buy her dead animals, I said no on the grounds of being vegan so now it means I’m a preachy vegan lol

Now complete the following example-
input: I thought today was going to be productive in my relationship with my ex-wife and our co-parenting, because we were going to have a joint birthday party for our 3 year old son (it was rescheduled from last month due to weather)

My ex called me about 8am saying that our 3 year old son had thrown up (he had been sick on Thursday/Friday as well).  She said that I needed to pick him up and watch him while she took my 6 year old to the party with all the other kids.  I got offended and replied why aren’t you the one that staying home?  Ex responded that she done everything for the party and couldn’t believe I had the audacity to even suggest that.  I don’t deny that she scheduled the party and got the cake, but the cost was always agreed to be 50/50 and if she asked me to do one of those tasks I would have.  I was about to start a spin class so I told her I would call her back afterwards, party because I didn’t want to get into it by just reacting.  According to her I hung up on her.  In all honesty time was short, it was 8am and the party started at 9:50.  The venu was non-refundable.

When I called back she had already decided that she would stay home with our son and I would go to the party.  Since I had also thought about the situation, I explained that I’d be happy to stay with him, but she said no.  She then yelled at me (in front of our 6 year old) about how she shouldn’t have to pay me child support, and that she’s working too much right now so I should have the kids more days on top of the extra days I have (right now it’s a 60/40, but most of the year it’s 50/50). 

I went to the party and afterwards I picked up my 3 year old.  Fast forward to after dinner she asked how or son was doing.  I told her he had thrown up again, but he was in good spirits.  (It’s day 5, so he has to be through this already, RIGHT?!).  I told her if he ate and was normal tomorrow am I was going to send him to daycare.  She then proceeded to tell me he shouldn’t go to day care tomorrow and if I did take him she was going to tell the daycare he was sick today - which either makes me look bad or I have to deal with leaving work to pick him up,  To prevent some reddit hate, I had already decided to keep my son home.

She called and I did not answer and she directly texted me “so then you’ll keep him home”, to which I have not responded.  I can’t think of any response I give that won’t just play into her trying to push me around and be aggressive towards me.  AITA?  I”m hoping to wake up tomorrow with some reddit induced clairvoyance on if I should tell the ex that my son is staying home, or just continue to not engage.

TLDR: It’s a pain in the ass to share kids with an ex-husband or ex-wife.  It sucks being forever linked to someone you weren’t meant to be with.

Now complete the following example-
input: I started dating my (18F) girlfriend just before the new year. Things have been excellent. Before I met her I had a tough mental health patch but I have gotten better with her help. Basically, things have been going quite well. We see eachother often, we laugh, we love eachother, and things are good. However, she’s not very affectionate. I’m over the top with affection. I say “I love you” at the end of every phone call, I buy her gifts when I can, I treat her like a queen every day. On the other hand, it took her a couple of months to tell me she loved me, and even though she told me she wouldn’t be as OTT with it as I am, she still hasn’t said it again. I can live with this, as the look on her face when I do something nice for her or when we’re together says more than that. Last weekend I picked her up from a night out, and I expected her to be all drunk and inlove and excited to see me, but she only seemed drunk.

Sometimes she’s not receptive to me being mushy and lovey. She refuses to be “in a relationship” with me on Facebook, or to post any pictures of me and her on either Facebook or Instagram, despite having pictures with her exes on both. She made new social media accounts to get away from people she didn’t speak to and to make new memories with me, but still frequently uses her old accounts. Until recently she mentioned her ex in conversation often. She normally followed them up with “but I’m with you now and I wouldn’t change it”. She’s apprehensive when I talk about our future as well. I AM moving country in summer, But i want things to continue. She says things are still early and we never know how things may end up, even though she wants the same, but the apprehension is something which you don’t expect, especially in the “honeymoon” phase of a relationship. 

In the past couple of days we had a few fallouts and arguments over things like her being incredibly dismissive of me being romantic after being receptive when we were together, or her not replying to me late on a night when she’s been active and talking to her friends. I know these things are stupid but I feel like I’m putting my heart on the line and not getting anything in return. 

It doesn’t help that she’s SUCH a stress free person, and often won’t entertain my worries about this stuff, and dismisses it as stupid. Deep down I believe she loves me and is happy with me, But sometimes I get paranoid and go moody.

AITA? 

TL;DR: My (18F) girlfriend is incredibly not romantic with me (22M), despite me being overly romantic and optimistic about our relationship. It’s causing me to have moods and little arguments with her which isn’t what I want.

M wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

Now complete the following example-
input: So my friend and I have been “friend” for the past 10 years. We have been through a lot together, both personal trials and friendship tribulations. For the past 2 years things haven’t been as good between us, and I’ve felt like I’ve been putting in effort for nothing.

I’ve made my feelings clear when I felt we were drifting apart, and let her know I didn’t feel she was being a good friend. I thought it would change but it hasn’t. 

She’s been the friend who is a friend when it benefits her, when she needs me, but I don’t feel it’s reciprocated.

She is now going through a very rough patch and has reached out to me for help. I want to be there for her but I also don’t feel she’s been there for me (she once stopped talking to me for a couple of months when I was depressed) and hasn’t made much of an effort to keep our friendship afloat.

So, Reddit, WIBTA if I tell her we aren’t friends anymore and I don’t feel like I can help her?

Now complete the following example-
input: So my group of friends (6 guys ~22-23y/o) has this 2 y/o tradition where we go to Boston for St. Patrick’s day and stay for the weekend, this year being the third time. We always go with the 6 of us and anyone’s gf. My best friend has been dating this one girl for about 8 months now and of course wanted to bring her along. Myself and one other in the group planned to bring their gf as well. So four weeks prior to st.Patrick’s day we’ve finalized the guest list (9 people) and reserved everything (bar crawl tickets, restaurant reservations, hotel rooms, etc. Now, for my best friends gf of 8 months this would be her first time there and, might I add, she was not very accepting of what we had planned - suggested different things/said she didn’t want to do the things our friend group typically does. 

Now a few days ago less than one week before we take the trip I get a text from my friend saying the gf has invited one of her friends to come along and the friend accepted and is planning around coming. She also expects that we accommodate her friend and adjust accordingly. Now I know the friend and she’s very nice and I have nothing against her - matter of fact we’ve gotten along pretty well the times we have interacted - but it’s much too late to change plans. Long story short, for her to be able to come we’d have to get another hotel room (we are all splitting the rooms equally so this would make the cost for everyone higher by about 100$ since all the rooms left at this point are very very expensive), get tickets for a different bar crawl than the one we already had cause they were all sold out by now, change the dinner reservations (not a big deal) and drive another car there (4 hour drive there and back). 

Of course I wasn’t gonna stand for that and flat out said she can’t come and to tell her she isn’t going and that his gf doesn’t get to invite people to go on our trip cause it’s our trip and she’s a guest on it. I also said she can’t make this trip HER trip instead of our friend groups trip as much as she’d like to. I’ll admit I came off a bit rude when I said this but AITA for saying her friend can’t come?

input: Please read fully before answering 

So there's this woman we both know, she's actually a co worker. My brother visits work quite often so she got to know her. He got her number and they've been talking. 

She's quite beautiful and I was also interested in her but I'm too shy. We've had conversations but I wouldn't say we're friends or anything like that. 

Anyway, it turns out she just wants to be friends with him, or atleast that's what my brother told me. He said he tried but it was obvious she wasn't interested. Oh well.

A few days later I find out by another co worker that she's actually into me (she even told her that she was frustrated that my brother talked to her instead of me) which is a huuuge surprise. I'm not too popular with the ladies if my username didn't make that obvious so I really want to jump at this chance but my brother isn't just a family member, he's one of my best friends and I wouldn't want to hurt him. He made it pretty clear that nothing was gonna happen between them but I feel like maybe that's because of me. WIBTA ?

Now complete the following example-
input: So there's this girl I dated, for 2-3 months. By the end she admitted she felt uncomfortable and caged in. Throughout the dating phase, she never felt comfortable with any physical contact and it didn't improve. I asked her if she wanted to break things off and she said ""yes, please.""

I was really bummed out, liked her a lot. Tried to always make her feel safe &amp; comfortable, showed a lot of affection by non-physical means. I went no contact on her to get over it ASAP, and during this time I moved on to a point where she doesn't interest me anymore, at all.

Couple months later she wrote me and told me ""she was waiting,"" I was confused and asked her ""for what?"" She said I became really important and she feels lonely and I was the first person she could open up to and be vulnerable to. Said she needs me, cries a lot thinking about me.  She asked me to go back to old ways and at least be her friend again, be vulnerable/open with her again.

The thing is... I just... don't care about her anymore at all. I think it's part of my coping mechanism. Also, she lives in another city now and I've never been the type to chat a lot. It's not like I actively ignore her texts, I answer politely but firm. I don't feel like investing anything back into it.

Am I the asshole?

input: My [23/M] live-in girlfriend [22/F] is going through a serious depressive episode. It's been so nasty that we've agreed she needs to start therapy again, and that we should talk to her doctor about upping her meds.

While she's in a depressed state, she gets very negative about everything and often makes her negativity quite noticeable. It's a real turn-off, it's very stressful and concerning, and it all makes it tough for me to get aroused by her. 

When I posted on relationship advice, almost every reply was someone thinking I was breaking up with her over her depression and leaving her when she needs support the most. That's not what I'm doing.

The other replies thought I was a terrible person and that my love was unconditional for not being turned on by her when her depression turns her into a debbie-downer who's got me concerned for her well-being.

Am I really the asshole for not wanting to have sex with my girlfriend while she's in such a dark, negative place?

Now complete the following example-
input: Let me start this by saying that I love dogs, and I’ve always wanted my own for a long time. My roommate and I started living together in August,  and things started out great. We have known each other since we were kids, and always got along very well. But these past few months she has stopped cleaning up after herself, and at one point her cats litter box hadn’t been cleaned in about 2 months. After asking her for a week straight to do it, I finally got sick and tired of gagging every time I walked into the bathroom so I had to do it myself, literally scraping cat poop out of the pan. I also always have to feed her cat, because my roommate sleeps 11-12 hours a day and only gets up at 15 minutes before she has to leave for work. She already has a ball python which I reluctantly agreed to, and once when I was gone for 10 days she trashed the place, leaving me to clean it all up. One of her friends dogs is having puppies soon, and when she asked if we could get one I finally put my foot down and said no. The apartment is only so big, and there is no back yard for the dog to run around in, since it’ll be a Husky-Lab mix it’ll need a lot of room to run. My roommate got really angry and has been very defensive, even saying “I’m just like her mom when I argue” and that she “deserves this dog” and when I say she can get her own dog when she lives in her own place she said that “she wouldn’t spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars by herself on a dog.” So what do you guys think? Am I being an asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: My sister in law is 24 and has three kids. Two have already been taken away, but the third is only a couple weeks old so she still has that one. 

In the past she’s been neglectful and chosen men and drugs over the other children. Right before thanksgiving, she went to a rehab program instead of jail for a child abuse case (of her second child). 

After she completed the program, she was moved into an apartment paid for by the state. She has no job, and is not allowed to have her current boyfriend at her apartment because he is a registered sex offender and she has her new son there. 

My in laws are raising the two kids she’s had taken away.

Well recently she posted on Facebook how she had gotten some “molly” and was going to do it with her boyfriend that night. 

I know what molly is. I know she had her baby with her that night, for sure. I knew she was also having a visitation sleepover with her second child that night. (The child was staying over at her apartment.)

I have nothing against casual use. I’ve done molly. However, given her history with drugs and child neglect, I was irritated she could be mistreating my nephews AGAIN. 

I called the police, told them what was on Facebook, where she lived, etc. They already knew exactly who I was talking about and knew the boyfriends name before I even gave it. 

Apparently when they checked her place out, the boyfriend wasn’t there. She had deleted the post, and her two kids were sleeping. She apparently refused to let the cops in her apartment. 

Well now my in laws are mad at me. They’re claiming my SIL has changed dramatically since November, and I had no right to be making calls to the police about her when I know that such calls could result in her losing her infant and visitation with her second child. They are claiming I invented the whole Facebook post I saw. My husband saw it too, but they’re insisting I manipulated him to say what I wanted him to say. 

I’ll be honest: I knew full well that making that call could effect her chances with her kids. But I didn’t care, considering her past. This is not the first time she’s “changed” and then went back to what she was doing. November wasn’t even that long ago. 

I know what I saw. I called the police expecting them to find her high as a kite with a registered child molester in her apartment. 

AITA? Now there’s a chance she will lose custody of her third child since she had police contact, and apparently she never did the drugs she said she had.

We live in a different county with a bigger animal control. I would ride with her to drop the dog off but I am stuck at work. I asked my boyfriend if he would go with her instead (have to have an in-county ID to drop off) and he threw a hissy fit about how this is ridiculous and he doesn't see why he has to go.

It's one of his days off and he is doing nothing else today. It will take MAYBE 45 minutes and he will be riding with her, no driving. 

I called around to a few shelters and they are all full, and that's when he finally said ""Fine, I'll go."" and hasn't said anything else to me.

Now complete the following example-
input: I left home to go to college in another state. I ended up marrying someone I met there, and we made our home in that state. We now have children. We visit my family twice a year for holidays. It is hard to go more often because traveling with children is hard and expensive.

My uncle passed away recently. After he passed away, his entire family (wife and kids) are angry at me. They removed me on Facebook, did not answer any of my texts or calls, and told my other Aunt to tell me we were not invited to the funeral. I've been told they are angry because I didn't move my family home to support them when he was sick.

I didn't realize they expected me to move my children and leave our jobs to move back to their state. Even if I had known they wanted me to, realistically I wouldn't have done it.

I did visit him three months ago and regularly texted. I sent gift packages. I have not offered financial support, but now that they are angry I am afraid that they would see an offer as an attempt to buy my way back into the family.

Is their expectation that I should have moved home a normal expectation? If so I guess I'm a jerk. I am doing some soul searching.

A bit of background info, I wasn’t the most behaved kid growing up and my patents forced me into online school when I was 15 and I wasn’t ever really allowed to leave the house, unless it was to work when I got a job. It severely impacted my social skills and I never was able to get out or have friends really. Since becoming 18 I do go out a few times a week. I follow my parents rule of being home by a certain time or keeping them updated on when I’m going to be home. I’m never out partying. If anything I hang out with my bf who is a few years older than me,and he makes sure I get home safe. Fuck I’m not even allowed to spend the night with him because I’m “still in school” mind you I’m a straight A honors student and work almost full time.

Now complete the following example-
input: Throwaway account because my husband is a redditor.

Probably should include a trigger warning for sexual acts and marital rape.

My husband and I have been together for almost four years, married for about a year and a half. I always thought I might be asexual (my parents used to think I might have been sexually abused as a really young child because of how sex repulsed I've always been). I didn't know for sure until I got married. Because I grew up in a Christian family, we never really explored that until after we said, ""I do,"" and it was a little late to find out the extent of my asexuality once we were officially married and I was having a hard time getting into sex, wanting sex, or feeling like I was being raped because I wanted to keep my husband happy, but I didn't like to have sex.

In a lot of ways, I do think I've experienced marital rape. In small ways, like the fact that I used to say no a lot, and he'd proceed with, ""Please, just let me."" I took it because I thought that's what I was supposed to do. My husband is not a mean man. He's very very broken, not good socially, and I have to take responsibility for not being good at communicating with him what I like and don't like. I think that's partially because I have really bad anxiety and I go into shock when things I would rather not happen are happening to me.

So, recently, my husband came out and told me he'd been performing sexual acts on a chatterbox account for money. He said he started the account in September and hadn't done it again since November. Of course, this was the same night he told me he had quit his job without any notice because he was tired of dealing with assholes at work. 

To my husband's credit, he's been working the night shift for seven months now. It's very difficult for us to see each other if he doesn't go to bed and get up at a decent time. Some days we will see each other for ten minutes total. I didn't want him to have this job, but it seemed like he wasn't interested in looking for a different one. So, he walked out of his job, then told me about the chatterbox account.

I've told him before how sorry I feel that we are so different sexually. I've told him that I wondered if I would be able to stay with him and let him explore other things sexually if it would keep him happy, but he said he didn't need that and wouldn't want to do that. I know, it sounds really stupid that I even brought this up as an option. But, I try very hard to be a wife that lets him make his own decisions and doesn't clutch to traditional marriage ideals so much that I can't be reasonable if he wants to do something I'm not immediately comfortable with. I really do feel bad that I can't be what he needs sexually, and if I was to just suck it up and have sex when he wanted it, he wouldn't like that either. He knows I don't enjoy it.

I told him last night when he broke the news to me that what he did was cheating. He said he didn't want to ask my permission because he knew I'd say no. I told him that was a pretty clear red flag that he shouldn't have done it. He disagreed with me that what he did was cheating. However, he made money off of masturbation, using toys, and who knows what else, received messages and solicitations from strangers off the internet, and used the excuse of, ""I never want to be with anyone else but you, it was just for the money and the sexual release.""

My aunt, who is the only other person that knows about this, suggested that I leave him. This, of course, isn't the only thing wrong with our relationship. We have a lot of problems right now, but I told her I couldn't imagine my life without him in it. It sucks, but he's my greatest friend. My only friend. Despite how this post may appear, he really is a creative, talented, kind individual with some really deep-seated issues.

AITA for wanting to stay with him even thought its miserable for me and possibly selfish for me to want to keep him to myself even though he isn't getting what he needs sexually? Thanks in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; My husband has been performing sex acts for strangers on the internet without my knowledge or consent, and I can't help but feel it's because I'm asexual, and I should just let him go.

Now complete the following example-
input: I'll start this out by stating that my family is religious. I am not.

I am studying music in university, and to help cover some of my tuition, I have been working part time as a musician and section lead with a local united church. My early music training was largely in the Anglican choral tradition, and much of what I learned then translates into my work now. I am well equipped for the job, regardless of my personal beliefs or lack thereof.

My mother has been making efforts to reinsert faith into our family's regular life in the form of prayer, bible study, and discussions. I humoured her by sitting in for a while, but for a number of reasons, it became an ultimately uncomfortable, and unpleasant experience, instead of a positive family gathering.

I have not been participating in these routines for about two months now. My mother has been putting pressure on me concerning my views, and I've been rather resistant to participating. She uses my job as an argument to claim I have ""emotional turmoil"" and that I need to join in (I work there because it pays well enough and the music style is both familiar and what I'm good at.)  and setting aside the religious points she's been arguing, she's also been saying I am keeping the family from coming together as a whole. 

I don't judge people based on the fact that they are religious, but neither do I see any reason in participating in someone else's practices/traditions. It seems disrespectful to people who do believe and disingenuous for me to join in prayer to a god I don't believe in.

TL;DR am I the asshole for not joining in family worship despite working at a church to pay tuition?

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm going to try to explain this as best as I can. I really want a third opinion on this so hopefully you guys can help me out. 

I'm the Patrol Leader of one of my Scout Troop's 5 Patrols. I'm not really respected in my patrol, and one of my assistant patrol leaders (APLs) has apparently been talking with another patrol's Patrol Leader to host a joint camp and exclude me. 

Considering that our patrol is not very friendly already and that I have already got nearly no respect from my members, I'm worried that such a camp will further reduce their respect for me and reduce our ability to work. My APLs are telling me they want me there ""unofficially"" but I feel like that's just going to reduce my members' trust in him and cause more major problems in my patrol.

Also, they say that they'd consulted me, which I don't recall ever happening, and also they'd told the patrol about it without confirming with me and so I'm pretty mad at them, but would I be the asshole if I didn't let this camp go through?

Also, what SHOULD I do instead?

P. S. I'll be asleep while you guys judge me, but please try to give me as much helpful advice as you can. I have no idea how to proceed and seriously need some help.

Now complete the following example-
input: Okay, so my wife and I have moved quite a bit throughout our relationship, and as such, thinfs have gotten packed and unpacked and mixed around numerous times. We've been married going on 4 years, and together almost 8, and in that time, we've moved 6 times (needed more room due to pregnancy, helped family, landlord neglect, etc. Not poor financial decisions). We've been at our current spot about a year and a half, and there's still shit packed away. Mind you, some of this shit has been packed away for nearly *three years* (the second last move, we moved into her mom's to lend her a hand due to declining health, so we rented a storage unit for most of our stuff). I've asked her about taking care of it several times, as it's mostly her stuff, because when I left my parents house, it wasn't on great terms, so I pretty much just brought clothes, my phone, and a few other things (not that I had much else anyway), but she always finds some excuse not to do it. The fact that it's been packed away for so long, and we aren't going ""hey, where is (insert item here)? I haven't seen it in ages"", kinda shows that nothing essential is packed.

I've been debating whether or not to go through it myself, save anything potentially sentimental and trash the rest. On one hand, it's cluttering our house. It's not hoarder level, and we're not living in squalor, but the unnecessary few boxes and few bags of jackets/blankets/old clothes that are still against the wall in our kitchen/in our front closet is getting irritating. On the other hand, I don't want to go through it, and then have her eventually want to go through it and get mad that I did it. I've asked her like once a month since moving here. Once or twice I've tried starting, and asking her as I go, and she just gets irked and tells me to put it off.

So, WITBA?

Now complete the following example-
input: First, some background.  I'm a pretty laid back guy and generally I don't let things bother me.  My wife, however, is more sensitive to how other people treat her.  I have 2 kids and my brother has 1.  My mother DOTES on the one child (my brother's), and to some extent ignores my children.  When my children excel at something, there is usually a comment about how the golden child can do that easily or how that thing is actually not very hard.  The golden child is showered with gifts, while my children are lucky if my mom remembers their birthday.  Oh, and my mother takes care of the golden child (babysits daily, drives him to classes, pays for classes) and maybe sees my children once a month.  This is partly because my brother is a single parent and doesn't really take care of his kid.  In general this has not bothered me, but my wife doesn't like the fact that my mother is not treating all her grandchildren equally.  

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a few years and all this behavior continues.  My mom then falls and breaks her hip and requires surgery.  When we are looking where she can go recuperate, I tell her she can't come to my house to recuperate. She likely wanted to come to my house because my wife is a stay at home mom and thus would be around all the time to help her out.  I can't recall the excuse I used but the real reason was my wife didn't want the stress of 1) being told her children are not as good as the golden child and 2) having the golden child now babysat at our house because that's where my mother would be and 3) seeing that differential treatment in her face on a daily basis.  She returned to her own house for recuperation.

So was I an asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: So about 5 months ago, I started this AU for a fandom which led to a lot of self-inserts and fanfics that added other writers into the story. I've been really into it and it seems so have a few of the other writers. 

Last night I got an anon called Concerned who said ""dude I like your work but hasn't the self-insert stuff gone on long enough? it's been five months. I'm worried Ao3 might end up like Wattpad if we're not careful lol.""

I responded with something like ""it's an AU, what did you expect? or did you mean stuff like this?"" cuz it was a song-based thing where I create song parodies and put characters and writers in it. They responded with something. I don't remember, but it kinda shook me cuz I've been really into it and so have some of the others. 

I decided to delete the comment and disable anon commenting. A few minutes later, I got an anon comment on another fanfic of mine from someone named Nope that said ""how much longer is this fic? I was enjoying it but is seems so open-ended. Is there an official climax to this and how much longer till we get there because it's starting to feel repetitive. I really like your work but, I want to know where you're going with this and if I should stick around?""

By this point, I had asked one or two of the other writers on this and one of them said it sounded like the same person from a month ago (I don't remember this, but I'll take her word for it). And Nope also sounded like Concerned. So I commented something along the lines of ""You have no obligation to stick around. These are MY stories, not yours.""

But then I decided that if I kept the comment, it might escalate, so I decided to delete that comment and disable anon commenting right after that. 

Like I said, I talked to a few of them to see if it HAS gone too far; one of them said maybe to tag those stories in the future so they can filter it out if they don't wanna see it. They've also said that it's up to me.

I know that it's likely not my fault, but I still feel kinda bad. So am I the asshole for telling the anon off?

My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

Am I the asshole for wanting to wear the shirt I made just once?

input: I am a 21 year old college student and have been going on dates with a guy for just over a week now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight he texted me and asked me if I wanted to go to a classical concert with him and his brother. I asked him if his brother would be upset if we didn't go and did another activity together. He said his brother would probably be a little sad.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this wouldn't be a big deal to most people. I felt uncomfortable for 2 reasons - I have only been dating the guy for a week and meeting his brother is pretty intimidating and kind of a big deal to me. I said to him that I'd rather join in on a group date we were also invited to tonight (bowling).   


He seems pretty understanding but I still feel super bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

AITA for not wanting to go to the concert and to meet his brother for the first time?

At first i refused to buy the ticket but after some thought i agreed because i planned to go overseas too and the last time i went over seas was 12 years ago.

Now complete the following example-
input: TLDR At the bottom

There are a few pieces of background here. 

My wife is 2nd generation chinese and there is a cultural expectation on her side to serve the elders first. 

Second, she asked me to post this on her behalf. 

I'm 33m and don't speak the dialect in which the argument was spoken. The version of events below was more or less as provided to me from my wife (not on reddit)

Lastly, this was during our 3yo daughter's birthday party with about 7 families.

The party was going well and there are a mix of families with about 12 kids and their parents. This was held at a McDonald's so they do take the main orders and we provided a pretty unicorn cake. All is good until it's time to cut the cake and there are 3year olds lining up to get at the cake. 

To prevent tantrums and hands in the cake we serve the closest people first. Anyway, grandma gets served 3rd last, and passes the cake off to her son. Wife gets another piece for her and grandma refuses the cake and is visibly upset.

 wife asks what's wrong. (All in their dialect, but with angry tones so it's clear they're arguing)

Grandma says she should have been offered cake first before the kids, pregnant wives, and my side (who all happened to be closer).

Wife calls her out in chinese, ""are you serious??? You couldn't wait to bring this up after the party? So you're throwing a fit at a 3year olds party?"" To which the response is she should have been served first and how dare you (my wife) scold me (grandma), i didn't come here for you to scold me.

Wife replies that it was an honest mistake and that she will try to remember next time.

Grandma replies, ""there wont be a next time, because you'll serve me first""

Issue currently unresolved as they left shortly after, should be noted she's pulled other small BS in the past. I.e. being angry at   being greeted, ""hey"" instead of ""hello"". 

My vote: NTA and pretty straight forward that you can't please everyone and that keeping toddlers happy is more important than wife's mom. Would like to know perspectives from culturea with the same cultural expectations about serving elders first.

TLDR: Wife's mom calls out wife in another language about being served close to last. Wife says she is ridiculous for throwing a fit at a 3yo's party.
output: ","Serving Toddlers, Parents and Closer kids before parents"

That's not super surprising, they're good friends and he's a solid guy, but I was put off by it.

We talked about it when we got home. I said it made me feel like she would rather talk to her co-worker than hang with our friends and me. She admitted she fucked up and needs to set up better boundaries. Promised me it would change and all that. I trust her, and I think she will stay true to her word, but I also don't think she's ready to get married if she has a problem with boundaries. So I was thinking I would buy myself something nice instead and save up for the ring throughout the year. Would that be wrong?

Now complete the following example-
input: Context: Husband and I (34) live with his parents, as do his brother's family (brother (27), wife (28), daughter (3) son (1)). Parents and BIL family on main floor, husband and I in basement. Busy, cramped household.

Argument from brother and his wife: I have no right to interact with my niece and nephew in an authoritative manner, in a ""parenting"" manner, no matter what the circumstances.

Argument from me: I've never treated their children even half as harshly as they themselves do, and remaining silent in the face of bad behavior/actions is to be complicit and send the kids the wrong message about socially acceptable behavior.

We have been living together like this since summer of last year (2017). My BIL and his wife had trepidation about moving in but the rest of us were looking forward to it, like a 'Full House’ situation where we could see our niece and nephew every day and have fun.

I became pregnant in late October and morning sickness showed up in early December and stayed my entire pregnancy. I didn't change emotionally, but physically I was overwhelmingly nauseous every single day ALL day for 7.5 months, some days debilitatingly so, and my interactions with everyone was massively reduced. There was the rare time I felt well enough to sit and play or color with my niece and nephew, but it was rare. Overall, I really enjoyed having them around and found joy in the simple things I could do that their parents weren't interested in, such as sitting at the door on a rainy day and listening to and identifying birds in the backyard, or discussing differences in animals and food, or whatever. I found I really enjoyed interacting with them in a teaching aspect.

Now my BIL and wife are very strict in some areas with their kids while surprisingly lax in others. The lax areas include how much noise their kids make, which isn't polite when living with 2 other families. I suffered my entire pregnancy due to their indifference of this fact. Being in the basement, every dropped item on the wooden floor upstairs sounds like a little cannonball exploding, while running in the hallway sounds like a stampede of rhinos. Due to the nature of the house build and duct system, voices carry very well too so raised voices/yelling sounds like it's 5 feet from my head in bed. It's honestly crazy loud and my husband and I have told everyone repeatedly. Simple requests such as having the kids play in the living room instead of stomping around above our head before 9 a.m. on the weekends have gone ignored.

My nephew was just shy of a year old when they moved in and nearly every night of his life, up until June of this year, he would whine and cry for up to an hour after being put to bed, and would wake up whining and crying loud enough you could probably hear it outside - multiple times a night. I was an absolute wreck my whole pregnancy because of it. I got no sleep for months and they never bothered to resolve this behavior. Whenever he is distressed during the day he makes the same noise - a siren-like droning wail that they utterly ignore, even though he persists for minutes and minutes. It's terrible and bothers everyone in the house except for them apparently. 

This noise is what started a 4 hour argument in July that I'm still reeling from.

I was 38 weeks pregnant watching a movie in the living room with my husband (we had no TV of our own). My husband's parents were gone for the weekend and my BIL's family was finishing up after dinner - dishes and getting ready for bed. Something upset my nephew and he started his wailing cry and after 20 seconds or so, when it was clear his parents weren't going to address it, I did what everyone always does and asked him a question to interrupt him and get him to stop and clarify why he's upset. I called out, “What's going on Bruce?” to get his attention, and my sister-in-law snapped back, “I've got it, thanks!” in the same tone she reserves for yelling at her husband and kids. I was shocked she would speak to me like that, and particularly for something as trivial as talking to her kid in an effort to get him to stop carrying on. I was pretty upset but didn't say anything, just went back to my bedroom.

The next evening, my husband's parents came home and were playing and talking with my niece and nephew while my BIL stood there. My BIL and wife have a strict 'no food after 7 rule’ for the kids which we all know. My mother-in-law was giving the kids some chocolate and it was 6:58 and she commented playfully, “Uh oh, hurry up and eat it or I'll get in trouble!” to which I seriously replied, “Yep, you better be careful” (because my SIL has been upset with them before for giving snacks so close to 7), at which my BIL turned towards me, gave me a hard stare and said, “Hey, no, we're not doing that right now” as if I was out of line. My husband heard, called out “What did you just say to my wife?” and that started an argument that lasted until after midnight - 5 hours of surprising accusations.

According to my BIL and wife:

It is extremely inappropriate to correct their children - ever.

This made no sense to my husband or myself and we brought up many instances where we had done so and they promptly told us we were wrong.  Things like:

 The backyard party when my nephew was getting ready to throw a croquet ball onto a glass top table? I was wrong to tell him not to do it, even though my BIL's wife stood there talking to another parent and didn't do or say anything.

 The time my niece kicked my nephew in the back and their parents didn't see? I was wrong to tell her that wasn't okay and to apologize to her brother and tell her parents what she'd done. BIL and wife absolutely heard all of this, but utterly ignored me.

 Interrupting wailing/shouting to get to the root cause and help them work through emotions? Wrong.

 Comforting crying niece and nephew? Turns out they'd just been punished so cuddling them and asking what was the matter was wrong.

Literally every interaction that isn't a watered down, “Hey, cool toy!” is 100% unwelcome.

To reiterate, no one else is as harsh with the kids as their own parents. We don't use sarcasm, we don't swear at them, we don't physically reprimand them (except to keep from doing something dangerous), and we don't ratchet up the intensity - in fact we've never actually shouted or yelled at the kids, whereas all of these tactics are employed by them both.

I know this is long, but months down the road we still have a shattered relationship. They insisted that once I had my kid I would know what they're talking about and agree with them, but I still think they're crazy, it still breaks my heart that I'm not 'allowed’ to have a normal relationship with my niece and nephew, one that includes love and fun and discipline where required. Since having my son they ignored his existence the first few weeks of his life - in fact my BIL's wife still utterly ignores him, while BIL will look at him and talk to him sometimes. 

It's hard to distill complex situations and relationships into some paragraphs, but what do you think? Am I an asshole for interacting with their kids in an authoritative manner?

Now complete the following example-
input: TL;DR at the bottom. My husband (43M) graduated college with a degree in journalism many years ago. He worked at the same paper as a reporter for over ten years, and was fired without warning or explanation about a year and a half ago.

Originally I was supportive, but six months after he was fired he still hadn’t found a job, anywhere. He was set on finding another job as a reporter even though it’s a dying industry, not looking at other fields. I had been gently asking him to look at other careers, but he refused as his experience and background are in journalism. I set him up with a life coach through my insurance to help support his job hunt, helped him with writing/rewriting his resume and cover letter, and encouraged him to go to a therapist since he was extremely depressed about being fired (he said he didn’t need to).

As his unemployment was ending and he still didn’t have a job, I gave him an ultimatum- find something, anything, or move out.

He found a slightly better than minimum wage job, which left me still covering the majority of the bills and anything for our ten year old son. After much fighting about his job, he decided he wanted to take the LSAT and go to law school. 

I supported him in taking the LSAT, offered to get him a tutor, bought books and practice tests, and took our son out of the house on Sundays so he could take practice exams. His LSAT score was mediocre. 

I told him I only supported him going to law school if it didn’t put us in a ton of debt. He’s received an acceptance and partial scholarship to one school, but it would still cost over $100k to attend. 

I have straight up told him I don’t support this. Unemployment for lawyers is extremely high, and that, combined with the debt we’d take on to do this, seems to make this an unreasonable career prospect at his age. I’d also like to be able to pay for my son to go to college, and with the timing and debt we’d take on for law school, doesn’t seem feasible to me (my husband says it does).

I’ve told him I’m not opposed to him going back to school for a new career, but it needs to have better prospects than being a lawyer. He says this is the only thing he’s interested in and has any skill in, that he’s finally found something he’s excited about and wants to do.

In another fight about this today, he told me everyone except for me is on board with this- his parents, his friends that are lawyers and judges. AITA for not supporting him?

TL; DR: My 43 year-old husband wants to go to law school to start a new career. I want him to choose a more realistic/less costly field. He says everyone except me supports this idea. AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: My ex boyfriend from when I was in my early twenties was a raging alcoholic. He was jealous, awful, short tempered and a serial cheater. He was my first boyfriend after I had come out and I dealt with it because I was young and in uni and didn't know better. After we broke up it got so bad that I had almost got a restraining order because he wouldn't leave me alone. 

Now a decade later I'm finally in a good place. I'm months away from marrying my partner of nearly 10 years and my life is going well. Except for my mother putting my ex in the picture. He has sobered up and found Jesus. Despite my mother then never accepting our relationship she's now all over him. 

They're both adults. He's 32 and although I understand that she can have whatever friends she want I do think she's being very insensitive to what he has put me through. All those years ago she has constantly put her faith over me and when we are finally reaching a point where I want to have her in my life and involved in my new life with my husband she decides to do this. 

She is constantly inviting him over when I'm visiting despite us being in the middle of planning my wedding. She's bringing him up in conversations and pushing his religious rebirth on me despite knowing that I'm not interested in taking on her faith. The worst was when she invited him to Christmas dinner without any notice while my fiance was there.

So, AITA for cutting her off until she realises that she is being insensitive. I'd rather have her cut off contact with him.

Now complete the following example-
input: So about a year ago I was paired up with this girl (who I will call W) for a project in my biology class. As we are working I start to just chit-chat with W about stupid things and videogames come up. To my utter suprise she is a avid gamer and it happens she also plays xbox. She is really into fallout and so am I. We then end up going back and fourth on Instagram about fallout 76 hype and other gaming stuff, and I would send her hella memes. We play often, and I have her favorited on xbox (this is important later). During this whole time my gf of a year and a half asks for my Instagram password and I willingly give it to her. So about a week after I give my gf the instagram password I go to send W a meme I made and I cant find her anywhere in my recent dms, I just think its a weird glitch and go on with my life. Later I go to unblock a different friend of mine after he spams me with 400 messages (he has done this several times after I smack him in for honor so now I just block him when he does it) and I see W on my blocked list. I wondered how she got there for a seccond but eventually just think nothing of it. I unblock her and go on with my day. A few hours later my gf calls me sobbing and asking why she isnt good enough for me and all this and that, obvoiusly im confused and ask her whats going on. She yells at me for unblocking W when ""clearly"" she has a problem with her. I dont know what really I did so I hung up.
Now everytime I try and dm W she is blocked, and gf will always get mad when she sees the notification that W sent me something. I threaten to change my instagram password if Gf keeps getting upset over the simple jokes and stuff we send to eachother. And then she gets even more upset, so I get even more upset. But I can see where she is coming from. She has told me several times that she is jelous that W and I have more in common than gf and me. She also told me that W is more attractive than her and I honestly agree, but I do love my gf and it hurts me that I have to hide my friendship with this person because its driving a wedge in my realtionship. 
In the summer gf comes over and we put up netflix on the Xbox, about 30 mins in I hear the notification  *ding* that it makes and look over, W just came online. Gf gets really mad that I stoped paying attention to her to pay attention to the xb. But then she sees who it is that I looked over for and she slapped me saying ""why that bitch on your xbox"" I try and explain why but she dosent want to hear it. So I get angry at her for always doing that and that I just want to have some friends. She told me that I can be friends with anyone but her. This arguement ends how it usually does when we argue about W. Gf just ends up leaving in a bad mood. 
When school started back up in the fall me and W have a class together and gf and I have none. This reaply tilts gf and it brings up another arguement about things out of either of our control. There is nothing either of us can do so we let it be. The first day rolls around and since me and W know each other we sit together in class to talk and what not. The gf hears about this and goes all out when I see her. I end up just getting sick of having so many arguments about W that I change my insta password and go out of my way to not see gf for about a week to let things cool down. This was the wrong move in hindsight. Gf gets dumb mad about that and turns out she been going at it with W over Snapchat and insta the whole week. I dont know If im just acting childish or she is.
About a month later me and gf chillin by my locker after school and W walks by, and I think to start somethin she says "" thanks for that color pack in warframe, im a broke boi so you came in big clutch with that gift."" Gf really didnt like that because I told her me and W stopped playing games, which was a lie. So of course it starts a arguement later and at this point I am done with all this so I just roll over in bed and ignore her till she gets tired and leaves. 


TL:DR: me and this girl play games and send eachother memes everyday. But my gf dosent like it but against her wishes I do it anyway
output: ",playing videogames with a girl when my gf hates her and has told me not to

Now complete the following example-
input: My wife's car started making a loud squealing noise coming from the brake booster, so I called the local dealership to get a quote on the repair. The told me that it was covered under warranty, and to bring it in. I even have 2 emails from them confirming the appointment, and the warranty coverage. We dropped the car off, and after 2 days they said they could not replicate the noise and for us to come pick it up, which we did. On the drive home from the dealership, the noise came back so I got it on video, put it on youtube, and sent them the link. They saw the video, thanked me for it and said to bring it back now that they confirmed the failure. My wife dropped it off, they supplied her with a loaner, and then right before closing they emailed me saying that it's NOT covered under warranty. 

I've been going back and forth with the service manager all evening arguing that they should honor the original deal. It's only $253.00 out of pocket for me, but that's not really the point in my opinion. The part is only 86.00 shipped, and I have a full lift in my garage (I restore old cars as a hobby) so I am more than capable of doing the job. 

Am I the asshole here for expecting them to honor what they promised me?

Now complete the following example-
input: This happened quite a while ago, but it's a situation I think about from time to time. I'm curious as to what Reddit thinks about it.

It was my friend's birthday. We'll call her M. She invited a few friends to go bar hopping, including a friend we'll call C. C's brother offered to be the designated driver for us. As the night progresses, C's brother buys us round after round of drinks. We did not ask him to do that. He just ordered for us, one right after the other. We got pretty toasty, so looking back, I probably would not have allowed him to spend so much money on me if I wasn't.

The next day, M told me that C's brother wanted about $50 repayment from each of us for the drinks. I said absolutely not. No one forced him to buy drinks for him all night, and we never agreed to reimburse him for it. Needless to say, C and her brother were pissed and refused to talk to me, though it wasn't like we were close to begin with.

I should add that he did not make a pass at me, and I was not flirting with him whatsoever. There was no romance involved in the situation. He bought drinks for everyone.

So AITA?

Valentines comes along and I bring him lunch and hang out a bit before heading to my test. After i finished, he texted me and asked me if I wanted to join him at Qdoba. I said sure and headed straight over, figuring that it would just be us. 

I get there and he mentions that B will be joining us. Now, don’t get me wrong, N is an amazing dude. He’s smart and funny. It’s not him I have a problem with. When he and my bf get in the same room together, though, both of them get lost in their own world. For that reason, when I know it’s gonna be just N, me and my bf I usually don’t come. 

My bf didn’t tell me he was coming, and sure enough, the entire night I say maybe 3 sentences because that’s all that I can add to the convo.

Now complete the following example-
input: So about a week back, last Saturday night, I had invited a friend of mine over to have dinner at my house on Sunday. We had already planned this twice before and either he or I was busy because of which we kept postponing. But we finally set a day and decided on a time for him to be at my place, 7pm. Fast forward to Sunday night, around 7, he wasn't there yet. He has had a habit of turning up a little late to get togethers at times but that's not something that bothers me because I'm the same way so I was pretty used to it. Anyway, I started making dinner to pass the time and before I knew it, it was 9. 

Sent him a text asking where he was then and got a reply at 10:30 telling me that I forgot to send a reminder text and was only texting so late to cover up for the fact that I didn't feel like meeting. This naturally turned in to an argument since I didn't feel I was in the wrong. I've asked a few of my other friends about it since and they've both agreed with me but, out of curiosity, I would like to pass this question off to everyone here. I know I invited him but was I really expected to send a reminder text if we had already agreed on the date and the time? He claims it's a courtesy to make guests feel welcome but honestly, I find that laughable. It's not a date and we're pretty good friends so I don't see the point of the formality. He does come from a family though that stresses these things quite a bit so maybe it was important to him. 

This is a pretty small issue. It happened a week ago and I was over it pretty much the day after it happened. But my friend keeps bringing it back up from time to time as ribbing and I honestly can't believe how he doesn't see he's in the wrong 😂. But there you have it folks, lay it on me, which one of us is the asshole here? 😂

input: Kontext: the last weekend I was on a trip with my girlfriend for 5 days with the last of the 3 staying at her parents home and getting to know them (we are in a long distance relationship). Days before the trip I asked her if it was okay if I worked on some stuff for my Dungeons and Dragons games during the trip as it was an overall 14 hours of train riding and she said okay. Now the weekend was good besides that I got very ill on the third day. I had some tummy ache for a few days already and It got really bad one day, I threw up a lot too. I didn't want to cancel the trip however and pulled through, going to both dinner with her parents and her friends. I felt pretty miserable the last few days but I wouldn't be visiting her home town soon again so I didn't want to waste the trip.






Now I actually hadn't done any work yet because the first 7 hours on the train we just talked a lot so I had no reason to. Same goes for the 7 hours back except for the last hour before she had to get off. We had nothing to talk about for the last 20 minutes or so already so I figured I could get some work in now else I get bored when I got nothing to do. My gf then started listening to music. Of course I closed my laptop in the last 10 minutes before approaching her station so we had some last time to smooch and cuddle before saying goodbye. So much about that. A few days later I went to the doctor to get my stomach checked. He did not find anything super worrying or irregular but took some probes and would get back to me with it on Monday. Now I told my gf basically everything he said in short Form and said she could ask me for more details in 2 days when we would videochat as I know she is noisy. Thing is I have some big anxiety problems and am an extreme introvert. Spending time with my gf is always exhausting for me because I am so close to another person 24/7 and I told her that's the case. So naturally 5 days without ever an hour to recharge my social batteries alone but instead meeting lots of new people that are important to my gf in a place that I do not know is extremely mentally exhausting for me. So I really needed some alone time after this which is why I didn't want to talk on the phone about my doctor's visit until our video chat.




Now I got a text from her and she is really pissed at me for pulling out my laptop to work in that last hour saying it felt super insulting and hurtful. 
Same goes for telling her we will talk about the details of my doctors visit during our video chat, she says it's super rude to not know what happened during your friend's doctor's visit until 2 days after, even though I really told her all the important stuff that happened. 
She says she always thought we had different understandings of kindness and not being rude and looks away often enough but this was to much for her. 
AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: Context: I'm a Level 1 tech working in a IT Helpdesk dedicated to our company as well as a few external clients; I'm fairly new as I've only been working there for about 5 months.

One of my colleagues, who shall be known as Steve for the point of censoring, has been working for about 2 months, doing exactly the same job as mine and sitting right next to me in an open office. We have the same manager, who's taking care of about half of the helpdesk's techs. I like him, I really do, but he's having a nasty habit, and I want him to at least be warned of the said nasty habit rather than getting fired.

Anyway, I've noticed about two weeks ago that sometimes (about once per two days), he's having a hard time dealing with our users (which I don't blame him for), he mutes his phone and says rude comments such as ""Shut up"", ""I don't care"" or just a plain old ""Fuck you"".

Now, since I do exactly the same job as his, I get the frustration I might have. I gave him my own trick when this happens (albeit it's much more rarely since I'm fairly patient): to use my hands and do a soundless strangling gesture; I also advised him about how another of our techs has a stress ball for this exact reason.

Anyway, I also warned him that our calls are recorded, and that he could be in huge trouble if he would either forget to mute himself or if someone from our QA program were to get ahold of a phone call where he'd be doing this; huge trouble as in one from QA, or even worse, external clients/employees could report this to higher management than our manager.

Speaking of our manager, he's pretty understanding and got our backs; I'm almost certain that he'd let it go this time since he's fairly forgiving and due to the fact that it's pretty hard to get fired here.

Obviously, I'd ideally not want to go through our manager, but after telling him more than 5 times, I believe he needs a firmer warning before it gets in higher management.

So, redditors, WIBTA if, despite my best efforts, I were to report my coworker's occasionnal rude behavior with the goal in mind that he stops before he gets fired for it?

TL;DR: Coworker's rude towards our clients, and his job is half customer service; I want him to be warned rather than fired, and my own warnings wouldn't go through.

Now complete the following example-
input: So for the record I don’t really think I’m an asshole for wanting this but my husband certainly does. Looking for opinions. 

We have a 2 year old daughter whos become quite the handful in the past year. I’ve stayed home since she was born and lately I’ve been asking hubby about hiring a part time nanny so I can get a break in the mornings. He refused saying that looking after the child is my only job and it makes no sense for us to hire someone while I don’t bring in any income. 

I feel like he’s completely disregarding my needs. Ever since our daughter was born, I’ve felt so trapped indoors and have had little time to even go out to see friends or eat lunch in town, which I used to do semi frequently when I worked part time myself. 

My husband works really long hours and won’t come home until 9-10pm so I can’t really ask him for help looking after her either. Financially I think we’re doing ok but my husband is always stressed about finances because we both have a bit of outstanding student debt but we’re chipping it down. So even tho he earns a lot he’s putting most of it towards our debt. While I understand his fears I still feel like this current situation is unsustainable. 

The other day I brought up my sisters family and how they have two nannies (one for childcare and one to cook) even tho my sister doesn’t work as well and my husband blew up at me. I’ve never seen him so mad. He said that I have one job and I do it poorly while he’s busting his ass supporting all of us while paying off my debts. He told me if I want to hire a nanny I could just divorce him and find some other chump to support me. 

I was upset and cried but he just stormed out and left me and our daughter alone. I don’t know what to do but AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: So this happened yesterday, and I'm feeling crappy ever since.I'm from the Caribbean,we're celebrating ""El carnaval"".Last night was my sisters dancing contest. My cousin and I arrived pretty early to save us some seats, (contest was supposed to start at 8pm we arrived a little before 6).We got a row of seats (8 seats) and so it started, we knew people would come to try to seat but at this point (6.20sh) there weren't any seats left available, we sat there and tried to hold on to the chairs as long as we could but of course it wasn't going to last. Well, let's forward to 9pm, a bunch of people broke into where we were seating (the contest took place in a public plaza) and they were of course blocking the view, it was pretty unfair but I mean what could you do? It was the monitory,we the ones that got chairs, vs everyone else. I figured I'd just step on a chair when my sister danced. Around 9.30sh started to get extremely crowded and seated people started yelling to the ones standing to please move or just seat on the ground so we could see the stage. My Dad got really pissed and started yelling to people in front of him, one of them say something back and there's when it started..yelling back and forth for around 2 min and then Dad gets up and grabs man by the shoulder(I have never seen Dad reacts like this) as soon as I see him tapping the mans shoulder I immediately run and get in the middle of them to push Dad, he couldn't care less, he ended up pushing me back and stuff got nasty, tried to calm him down and sit him but I couldn't, then my Mom got into it too and suddenly I was pushing both them back,Dad started yelling at me to move the fuck out(that's the kind of stuff you never expect your dad to yell to u in PUBLIC)he tried 4 times to get up to fight the guy but every single time I pushed him away, then a random guy (finally some help!) got in the middle and helped me separate 'em. I asked Dad to please seat on my chair so he stays away from the other guy, but he again asked me to shut the fuck off, at this point Mom did nothing( thanks mom! Such great help), I was so frustrated,Dad wasn't listening so I grabbed him by the face and laid eyes on him expecting him to chill but he just pushed me away and again asked to move the fuck off.. once both seat back I grabbed my stuff and went for a walk to calm down., turned off my phone, watched my sister from the distance (her boyfriend was with me). I was so frustrated,I felt so alone, unprotected, Dad apologized, but I don't want to see neither of my parents. WITA for leaving them and walking out of the situation? Should I have stayed? Am I being too dramatic?

input: Context: I (18 y/o) suffered an accident about a month ago, and part of my recovery is to walk a lot every day. I take a cane with me just in case, through I'm not visibly disabled and walk pretty well, though I get tired after walking a long way. A few days I go, on return trip from my walk, I was tired and a bit hungry, decided to stop by a Burger King. 

As I was going through the doors, I wasn't paying much attention, mostly from being tired and lost in throught about something else, and a stranger that was exiting just before I was entering held the door open for me. I didn't acknowledge him or say thank you, see being tired and lost and thought, but I still recognize that I was rude regardless.

After I passed, I only realized that the door was held open for me because the helpful stranger said *""You're welcome""* in a quite annoyed way after waiting for my ""thank you"" that never came, and he left. At the time I felt pretty bad, only then realizing my mistake, but then I got annoyed that the stranger seemed to be offended that I, a tired young person walking around with a cane, didn't say thank you, and decided to voice his offense in a snide ""you're welcome""

This is probably an incredibly insignificant AITA post, but after thinking about it I really want to know what y'all think. Who's more of an asshole, me who didn't say thank you, or the guy who gave a snide ""you're welcome""?

Now complete the following example-
input: Hello, all. I've been wanting to get this out of my chest for a while now and I found this sub in which I think this belongs to. Also, sorry for the broken English. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, three years ago I started experiencing small but noticeable twinges on my male parts, mostly the nuts. I simply decided to ignore them given that my sexual life at that time was really active (Married, sex only with wife) and my drinking habits were also heavy, so I thought that the reason for the twinges were either an infection or something that I decided to threat on my own taking some pills I found on my medication drawer.

Time passed by and 3yrs fwd (Today's day) pain began to grow to other parts: vas deferens, prostate, itchy rectum, night sweats, pains in the lower parts of my vertebrae and other symptoms. The worst of it all is that it's been a month now that I've been ejaculating blood, like, blood, you know? No white just red drops. I think it's called ""hematospermia"". SO I decided visit doctor.  
Went to visit an Urologist and told him about what was happening and since when it was happening. Needless to say, he was shocked for how long I've been delaying this and told me that all of that might only mean prostate cancer, that I needed to get a diagnosis and discard whatever is happening. That it may not be that late and we might get this thing cured IF cancer is what is affecting me, otherwise I'll just need to take some pills and go through some recovery and whatnot.  I know this is not the way in which you usually approach your patients, but well, such is Mexico. 

I was in shock, like, I relentlessly convinced myself that all of my pain and suffering was due to an infection or my bad habits and the realization and the probability of me having cancer depressed me and put me on a really strange situation with me and with mostly everyone around me.   


So, I went to the clinic and asked about the price for such diagnosis and testing and everything and was surprised by the amount of money needed in order to get this thing discarded. Like, what if I don't have (cancer) and it is just a bad infection? I don't want to pay for them to tell me that I just need to take medicine and will be OK, nor I want to spend money on the baddest news of all my life.   


Instead of spending money on such thing, I decided to visit Japan :) . A place that I've always wanted to go and have the time of my life. Spend all the money that I've been saving on the trip and have a blast, meet Japanese girls, get drunk on a Karaoke, eat Ramen on the street, take some pictures of a Sakura tree, sleep in a capsule, meet Japanese girls x2, visit Aokigahara (it has a really spiritual meaning for me) and probably stay there for as much as I can. Mexico has this really great relationship with Japan and I've been reading that I might even get a job there.   


My family knows about all of this since yesterday and they were not really happy about my decision, they called me ""Selfish MF"" but I don't care. If I do have cancer I rather visit the place of my dreams and then I'm willing to accept whatever life have for me, if I don't, well, at least I got my pp sucked by an actual wifu. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, am I the asshole?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - There is a big chance I get diagnosed with cancer and instead of following my doctor's suggestions and have it discarded and treated, I decided spend the money visiting Japan.

Now complete the following example-
input: 
My boyfriend and his friends go away for a weekend and this year I am able to go. I was told the weekend was solely devoted to getting as drunk as possible and hanging around having fun. At the time I was invited, I was the only female going and asked them if it was okay if I could bring a friend of mine. The OK was given, I asked, and she said yeah. I’ll call her E. 


Sometime between late November and mid-December, E expressed to me that she had an “intrusive thought” (her words) of being drunk and woken up in the middle of the night with a guy on top of her trying to have sex. She said she knows it’s happened to other people and it could happen to her as well. I responded as compassionately as I could to reassure her that she would be fine and god forbid something did happen, I would hold the guy accountable and get authorities involved. At the end of the conversation it seemed that all fears were soothed and things would be fine. 


That was until I got a text from E a few hours later saying she was going to meet a guy from Tinder in the near future.  That wasn’t my problem, E is an adult and can do what she likes. My issue is with what was said next. She communicated that she had planned on watching movies with him and “getting dick” (again, her words). There was no other context, no clarification as to when this encounter would happen. I assumed (I know, I know) that it was going to be happening the day of them meeting for the first time. I was livid. In my mind, E had just accused these guys I consider friends to be predators and was fearful of them raping her, but was totally fine with hooking up with this Tinder guy she had never met before and had no fear of being assaulted by him. E never mentioned the fear of being assaulted by Tinder guy. 


Another piece of information: E has told me that she’s attracted to not one but two, of my boyfriend’s friends who would be with us that weekend. I’ll call them T and J. J has a girlfriend and T has been single a few months now. T and E talked, but T wasn’t interested and it died off. E has expressed wanting to hook up with T but T is not that interested. T has said however that if he was intoxicated and feeling E, he would hook up with her if she still wanted to. I warned against it but we’re all adults and can make our own decisions.


I didn’t express my concerns and hurt with E about what she said until the next day when I felt that I could respond calmly. I asked her when she planned on hooking up with Tinder guy, where, and how and why I was upset that she thought my friends could be predators. She backtracked. Suddenly it was , “oh i’m not going to have sex with him, i’m scared of him too,” and so on. I felt a tad better, but a few days later that fear of mine popped up again. The conversations seemed weird to me and it didn’t seem like she cared that I was upset about what she said and was just trying to save face. It then crossed my mind that E could be actively seeking drama. I wanted to give E the benefit of the doubt, but the thought that she could ruin someone’s life because she was drunk and regretted hooking up with them was constantly on my mind. (E has said before that she doesn’t want her first time to be a hook up. If that were to happen I don’t see why she wouldn’t regret it later, especially if T doesn’t engage with her the way E wants him to. I know that some false accusations are indeed because the female was upset and vengeful.)


Disclaimer: I’ve never seen E really intoxicated so I don’t know how she is. She doesn’t have a history of lying or exaggerating things that have happened either. Doesn’t mean she wouldn’t.  And mixing that with alcohol is not a good idea. At all. I could say the same for the guys, I’ve never seen them assault someone, but it doesn’t mean they wouldn’t. (just playing devil’s advocate here) There is also no history of assaults, physical or sexual, happening during this weekend in the past. 


I rescinded E’s invitation for the sake of my sanity and so I can have a good time. Was it wrong of me to think she could possibly do that? Am I wrong for prioritizing my experience when she has no history of doing seedy things?

Now complete the following example-
input: My family has a small farm we jokingly refer to as a ""Fisher Price farm"". We have horses (normal and miniature), a donkey, goats, geese, chickens, a rabbit, dogs and cats. I own some of the animals myself and some belong to my parents- the vast majority of the animals are rescues. My mom absolutely loves inviting people, especially kids, over to hang out with animals they may not normally meet and to ride our horses. She always expects my help handling the animals and children, which I don't mind, I love animals and like kids. 

&amp;#x200B;

The current problem is that my mom thinks I'm way too firm with children around the animals. I think that what I say is for the benefit of our pets' health and stress levels, and to keep the kids safe. She says that I'm a ""killjoy"", that I ""make children and parents uncomfortable by being too controlling"" (her words). This stung a bit I'll admit since I dislike having to be the one with boundaries but I consider my mom a people pleaser who wants all the kids/adults to have an idyllic farm experience without any realistic boundaries. Here are some examples of points of conflict:

Kids are chasing chickens around in 90 degree (or hotter) weather, until chickens are panting and obviously overheating. I say ""Please don't chase them, they're nervous and it's too hot for them to run this much. There are quiet chickens right here you can pet or hold gently!"" Repeated multiple times, eventually dropping the please. Finally pick up the chickens they're chasing (chickens don't run from me, they know my call) and put the chickens in the coop out of reach. Mom says that I'm ruining their fun and that it won't kill the chickens to get a little hot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Kids running around the horses' hindquarters, hitting them in the face with a metal comb, screaming in excitement. I say ""Guys, you have to be quiet and calm around horses or they may get nervous and spook or kick. Be gentle when you brush the horses."" Mom says it's fine, our horses are safe and quiet. I remind her that the horse in question once kicked out and caught her in the thigh when a horsefly bit her. Mom says I'm scaring the kids and getting worried over nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Kids chasing already skittish cats, I ask them to not do that and play with the dogs instead, mom says it won't kill the cats to get chased. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's a lot more unfortunately.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually my mom says maybe she shouldn't ask me to help her anymore with kids around since I'm ""a killjoy and make people uncomfortable"". I have never swore at, shouted at, or even raised my voice at kids. I always try to be calm but firm. However the one time I wasn't supervising it (in a roundabout way, to be fair) ended up with the death of one of my chickens so I'm not confident in my mom's ability to supervise all the animals and kids. I often time get left watching 6-8 kids by myself around a barn with large animals while my mom chats with the parents. That's also been frustrating. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm afraid I am a killjoy and an asshole for being firm and maybe over controlling? I do really try to be polite but I know that I often put what I perceive to be the animals' comfort/wellbeing over kids' enjoyment. I'm happy to clarify anything, I want to be as fair and present all sides as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mom thinks I'm kind of an asshole and too controlling about kids playing around our animals, i.e. telling kids to stop chasing chickens or lower their voices around horses.

Now complete the following example-
input: To start this off I’m 19. My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I’m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I’m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to “get off my ass and do some real work for once”. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said “I’ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don’t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.” I responded with “You always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can’t you do it now, I’m sending out the bills for this month.” He replied “Fuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.” This is where I got pissed off “First of all” I said “ you are not my boss, I’m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it’s going to be me telling you.” “I’m not taking orders from a damn kid” he said. “ Look, I know it’s hard to take orders from someone that’s young and that is new here but you know what’s harder?”there was a pause and he said “What’s that?” “Feeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.” He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn’t said anything to be since. 

So AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?

Now complete the following example-
input: Every year, my girlfriend\[F35\] and I\[M36\] participate in her company's golf tournament. There's like 150 people there. Some playing golf. Some helping out with food and drink and such.

A colleague of her's is this guy, Gary. She and I have been in social situations before with Gary and we both just do not like this guy. He's a meathead gymbro alpha type. Which is fine. Up to the date of the forthcoming story, he'd never directly been a dick to either one of us but he just wasn't the kind of person we'd hang out with. Now, he *had* been really awful to my GF's friend in the past by promising her sex then laughing and backing out of the arrangement when the friend tried to get intimate. That was really awful but I wasn't there so, who knows?

Anyhow, on the day of the golf tournament last year, Gary wasn't playing golf. He was selling raffle tickets on the 11th tee. Now, for context, know that this golf tournament is a booze-soaked affair and just about everyone was toasted pretty nicely at around 1:30 in the afternoon. GF and I approach Gary and another colleague. Drunken pleasantries are exchanged, no one is rude or anything, yadda yadda yadda, Gary offers my GF a ride in his golf cart. But, she'd have to stand on the back and hang on because both front seats were occupied. Apparently, in her drunken state, this seemed like a good idea. After the fact, she said she was doing it ""to be nice.""

So, they tear off in the cart, GF standing on the back. They don't go 100 feet before Gary quickly cuts the wheel and tips the cart over. GF falls off the back and goes rolling. Gary is of course laughing his ass off at what he's done. He was safely seated in the front so he's mostly unharmed. GF has some scrapes on her elbows and bruised legs. FORTUNATELY, no serious damage. She walks away fine. I immediately just went to GF to make sure she's OK. She vigorously assures me that she's OK then starts pushing me towards the next tee because I have that beer-infused confident fire in my eyes that says, ""I need to have words with this guy.""

Instead, we all just move on and forget about it.

Well, this year's golf tournament is coming up and this guy is going to be there and he's probably going to want to do his gymbro thug hug when he sees us. WIBTA if I just ignored him completely?

TL:DR: WIBTA if I snubbed a guy who tipped over a golf cart my girlfriend was riding on?

input: **Intro** *First draft was 8,500 char over limit. I will link the full story, here is a poorly edited one trimmed to 3000 ASAP.*

***I'm asking if I'm an asshole for telling my wife I was mad he came in her and also for making him apologize to me.*** *But if I or anyone else is an asshole for another reason I'm interested. Questions welcome. Thank you.*

**TL:DR; see full version**

Married 10 years. Kinky.

Friend has GF for 1 year. Says sex is boring. Knows we swing and wife likes cum.

Him and GF invite us out. My friend propositions me with partner swap- his whole angle was that his girlfriend has a huge crush on me and he thinks it'll help their relationship if I do her. Doesn't mention wife.

I pity him and agree.

In the uber I tell wife what we're doing.

About to bone... GF says no condom, but don't cum inside. I say ""*looks like we're cumming on some titties*"" to my friend. He grunts agreement.

Sex happens... he cums in her hard. She's thrilled. I'm pissed but contain it.

Later, I tell her he just wanted to cum in her because his girlfriend doesn't let him. She looks at me like I'm stupid, duh. I told him to cum on your tits. She doesnt remember. I did.

She dismissed my feelings instead of working through. Maybe thought I was blaming her and was mad at her about it, says she owns her pussy, that she can't believe *I'M* shaming her, she only did it for me, etc.

Tension.

Last night I confronted friend. He admitted planning to cum inside. I told him that was fucked up- He said and didn't think of it that way, everything was true, wife said it was okay. Didn't know it was a big deal and apologized genuinely. I accepted.

I was mad because...

**Expectations**: sex-god alpha male, here to fulfill innocent girl's fantasy and save friend's sad boring life + impress w/ wife.

**Reality**: a couple tried swinging

**Result**: suddenly emasculated that I wasn't in complete control. But now I've learned, won't do it again.

Told wife the good news, she got mad. Said if I can't manage expectations, thats my problem, ""It's not fun if I have to worry about you freaking out"". That I had no right to make him feel bad for something he didn't know about and I'm egotistical. Took a lot of trust for her because there was no plan and my reaction I ruined it.

I asked her to do something sexually extreme (service my friend) she wants praise, affection, but I think she's martyring herself here. Never had negativity towards her at all. But I also have a duty to resolve doubts and misunderstandings before they grow into resentment. The idea that I should have shoved my feelings inside and ignore them seems ridiculous.

Am I The Asshole?

input: We live in a moderately affluent school district where there are some families that are well off.  The High school is good- good academics, great arts programs.  I make a good amount, but due to poor decisions in the past, am living paycheck to paycheck.  Almost the standard in the US I think these days- a couple thousand in medical bills that I am paying fine, several more in credit cards- I am not behind but have little in the way of savings.  
Enter the once every 4 year super mega band trip.  HAWAII!  We live in the Midwest.  Cost for the trip BEFORE airfare is $2700.  Airfare expected to be at least another grand. that works out to a $300/mo payment each on the handy payment plan.  I have 1 kid that never asks for anything, and is the saver who is all F this trip- lets save money and go somewhere else. I have the spender who is an incoming freshman who is all ""I want to go and i will save money and work even though i have never done it before""  I think it is irresponsible for the directors of the band to plan out such an extravagant trip- it isn't like the rose bowl or anything- the kids will be using rented instruments to play a concert in a park.  I feel like this is really a haves vs the have nots- and I hate that feeling.  Am I the asshole for not wanting my kid(s) to go on this and questioning ""when is enough enough?

fwiw- yes there are opportunities for fundraising, but we have alienated a pool of people seeing as we lean blue in a red state, and we already raise $1000 a year for the normal band fees and another $1000 for Show Choir.

Originally I was supposed to go with her but when it came time to buy the tickets to get there, I wasn’t able to get the time off work. She understood and everything was good right? Well, fast forward to two weeks ago, a friend asked if I wanted to join him and a coworker on a boys fishing trip.

Here’s where I think I might have messed up. We transferred someone in from another department so we’re a little over staffed in my area at work now. So...I can get the time off. I never told my gf this because the tickets had already been bought and I was just planning on going to work anyway and she didn’t seem to care whether I went with her or not. I told my buddy I could go on the fishing trip.

Today my friend said something to my gf about the trip during casual conversation and I’m not sure I’ve ever seen her so angry in 4 years. She’s threatening to break up with me because she says she can’t trust me and what I did was disrespectful to both her and her family. 

AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: Ok, so I know that I am not entitled to anything, but please hear me out. First a little bit of background: I am a schoolteacher and we just got a new teacher in our grade level recently. My team and I have tried to make her feel welcomed and include her in everything we do. We share resources, materials, and advice. She’s always polite but answers in one or two words. 

Last week we had to be at a meeting in another campus but had to be at our school first. She doesn’t have a car, so she calls a family member to pick her up instead of riding with one of us. She’s not comfortable with us yet. That’s fine. I totally get it. We ask her to go to lunch with us, but she declined. She did, however, go to lunch with teachers from another school (where a relative of hers works). All right, that’s fine, I guess.

Anyway, fast forward to this week. It is the 100th day of school and kids and teachers celebrate big by doing 100-related activities all day. This year, our administration decided to have a “team spirit” contest. Basically, each grade level dresses up and best one gets a prize. On Wednesday, our team leader asked us if we had any ideas. New teacher replies “Oh, I already made myself a T-shirt” (we know she owns a cricut because of FB but has never mentioned it to us directly). I about lost it. I’m so mad she didn’t even offer or tried to ask us anything. I am not saying I wanted a shirt for free or anything. We all would’ve paid her for her time and bought our own shirt, but she didn't say anything! So when I went to the store to get our stuff to dress up, I didn’t get anything for her. And now we are not winning “team spirit” because she’s the only one dressed differently. 

I feel I’m being petty, so I don’t wanna let it get to me, but we all are tired of trying to include her and her not reciprocating, so AITA?

The only kind of jobs I can get tend to leave me vulnerable to bullying and feeling outcast and depressed because I can't even do menial tasks very well and get constant criticism from my my supervisors/ managers. Anyway there is a work program thing that helps you find work, and they put me onto an unpaid work placement in a College. I was extremely excited to start, it was initially meant to be a four week placement. The job itself was testing their new application system. I did this to the best of my ability, I drew up an extensive report on the website and all its functions, and gave it to my boss and copied in the developers. I worked hard to get it done quickly and as professionally as I could, and I got positive feedback from the boss. But nothing seemed to come of it. None of my suggestions were taken into account. The Developers are socially awkward in their own right, and I felt were dismissive of me as a tester, and ignored any feedback I gave them. It just felt like busy work and I felt more and more demotivated. Sorry I should say this is long after 4 weeks, those 4 weeks became a month, then two months etc. Eventually he said he would try to create a part time job as a tester. They couldn't just give it to me because of employment laws, but he strongly urged me to apply when it came up. It would take around 6 months from then to create the position.  In the meantime I was still attending the work program place, they have these sort of classes/ lectures that you go to. Some of it is helpful but a lot of it is just nonsense frankly. Anyway I also got kicked off one benefit and put onto another, which means a huge amount of stress and paperwork and the new benefit is notoriously difficult to be on and they make life as hard as possible for you to force you into work. Fair enough but I believe that the kind of jobs they put me in don't last very long anyway, the work program has a better attitude of finding the right thing for me so that I will be able to stick with it. But ironically because of all the bull that goes with being on this new benefit I was struggling to make time for the work placement, and moreover I was getting extremely stressed about my situation. For this reason I contacted my previous job coach about the future of this work placement. She said she'd speak to them then get back to me the next week. She didn't, so I took the excuse to have some time out and wait to hear back. Which I never did.  
Since then I spoke to my new job coach and asked if it's unusual to do an unpaid job for 6 months, and she told me it isn't, some even go for a year. So I now feel like an asshole, I have basically given up a chance I was given, maybe my only chance to find a job I enjoy at least somewhat.

TL;DR am I the asshole for giving up an unpaid internship/ work experience job that may have led to part time employment?

I said no man. He said common bro. I said alright fine. Fast forward to 2 days later when I return the car and the guy says he smells some smoke and has to charge me the $250 cleaning fee. I said I won't pay it but obviously he charged my card anyway. I tried to charge it back with my bank but unfortunately this is one of the rare cases they can't help me out.

Now complete the following example-
input: Little bit of background, joined a site maybe July last year? Putting up an ad with my email wanting to learn more about worldwide cultures and just generally find it interesting meeting new people. I stopped using it around September because I just ended up getting weird requests from older men which wasn’t what I was after at all (I knew it was a risk from the start) 

I’m from the UK (23F) then around beginning of this month someone else from the uk (21F) we had a really nice conversation just about general life, films etc so we ended up exchanging numbers - seemed legit and non weird. She mentioned she suffered from anxiety and doesn’t really have any friends other than her cousins who she’s close with. She said she found friendship in me and I was easy to talk to (I’m pretty down to earth so I get that) this was nice...

All went well until last week when she began messaging me about her neighbour (67M) about she woke up after a party with him at her feet (holes ripped in her tights by her toes and her shoes removed). I mentioned how that was weird, she then always spoke about feet and him, “winding him up” for his birthday with a voucher for “a hand job and spanking”. I said what if he actually cashes these in? She said “I can’t let the birthday boy down” - I let it be, hey who am I to judge about her sex life. You do you hun. 

Then things got really weird when she said how she wanted to give the same vouchers to her step dad but including other things like face sitting. I started to feel uncomfortable and she continued saying how “when I visit her” (this was never discussed or arranged) Her step dad will be my foot slave. She also has another penpal (37M) who she kept referring too, when she said about all four of us having a sexual time together. 

I just stopped replying. I couldn’t take anymore, it made me feel uncomfortable. No matter how many times I kept mentioning my boyfriend and how I’m not into any of this. Trying to get the conversation back on track to the previous nice conversations but she’d always turn it back into this. I ghosted her and it’s been 3 days. I get relentless emails and messages until this morning when I got one saying 

“Hi (37 M penpal) &amp; (me) - delete my number, I’m having mental health problems and can’t deal with this world anymore” 

Am I the asshole for leaving someone who needed help because she made me feel uncomfortable?

Now complete the following example-
input: For this one, I need to start a ways back. My first girlfriend was in middle school, 8th grade. It was the typical middle school romance, her coming up to me and asking ""Will you be my boyfriend?"" and me agreeing while having no idea what having a girlfriend entailed. Needless to say, it  didn't last long before she broke up with me. I wasn't at all hurt about it.  


Skip ahead to high school. We developed a close friendship where we spent a lot of time together and she often called me. I wasn't the best friend, but who is in high school? I was a bit of an asshole, even giving her the nickname ""Penguin"" because of how she waddled while she walked. She adopted the nickname and loved it and I never told her the real reason for it. But still, I listened every time she called me about the boys she was interested in, I listened every time she broke up with a boyfriend and cried about being single, and I even dealt with her asking me during these periods, ""Do you think we'll ever get back together"", to which I replied, ""No.""  


This went on for many, many years. I went off to University and she still called me about the same problems and still asked the same question. Finally, after listening to her despair about being single forever for the 30th time, I broke. I told her ""\[Name\], do you enjoy being single?"", she said ""of course not"", and I popped back with ""Well, you better get used to it if you keep doing this shit."" Silence ensued, then I (or maybe she) hung up. I have to add in the detail that I was slightly intoxicated when this happened.  


The calling stopped and from what I heard, she actually started having some meaningful relationships to the point where now she's engaged. I ruined a friendship, but a part of me says that it was worth it and I was helping a friend. AITA?

input:      Last Saturday, I attended a “going away” party for a friend who’s headed into the Air Force. Including myself and my girl friend, all the people in the party are a close knit friends of about 15 people. Prior to the party, a girl, who I’ll call “K”, and I have been talking about her emotional struggles with her relationship and her inability to see a future within herself. I aided her to the best of my ability and throughout the night of the party, I continued to do so. Right after I’ve almost sobered up and I was about to leave, K suggests  she and I go swim in a nearby lake. I say yes, but with no actual intention to do so because it was around 20F that night. She and I walk to the lake, continuing to talk about her mental state and once we reached our destination, I prevent her from swimming. We talk for around 20 minutes and before we decided to head back, I ask to platonically kiss her. I ensure her that my girl friend would not mind so she says yes and we do so.

     We head back and I get in my car to leave and as I was about to put the car on drive, K leans in through my car door and kisses me again. This time longer and slightly more involved. K asks to text her once I get home and I head on my way.

     Later in the morning, I hear from my girl friend that immediately after I left, K cried into one of my friends arms. I’m not sure what was discussed, but I hurt K and confused her when I was genuinely attempting to help her. I’ve had to leave the group chat we’re all in and I’m not talking to anyone there for at least a week in order to give them space. 

   AITA for doing what I did?

Sorry for any formatting issues, I'm on mobile.

Little back story on this as follows.

My step son (22) can not and will not hold a job to provide extra income for the household when he easily eats $100 in groceries per week, has a cell phone on our plan, as well as an Xbox One and Xbox Live. (He pays for the gaming stuff himself but when he gets a job he works 1-2 weeks and quits.)

I've been telling my wife for the last year or two years that I am getting sick of supporting him and he needs to move out as he is literally bleeding us dry financially and mentally.

I've had enough of it myself and finally told him he has until the end of the month to find a job and if he quits it with in 3 months his stuff will be on the lawn and he will need to find some where else to live. 


AITA for this?


TLDR; step son refuses to work and keep a job and we can't mentally or physically afford to support him any longer, want to kick him out.

input: This friend/acquaintance (large longstanding friend group) has a history of asking me out every year or so I’ve been single (5 years), often dramatically and uncomfortably. Every time I say no and I don’t think of him that way. All it takes is me being slightly friendly such as a smile or a joke and he does it again. 

Today he left me a voicemail. All it said was “Hey, I need your help, call me back if you aren’t busy.”

The fact that it was cryptic made me nervous, but if he was really in need or having an emergency I didn’t want to ignore him. 

- I called him back and he immediately said, no nothing is wrong, I just need you to go on a date with me. 
- When I expressed frustration, he made some guilt-tripping comments about how I’m disapproving and judging him. 
- He said, he’s been set up on a blind date he doesn’t want to go on. He needs to have a date with me as an excuse. 

I felt what he did was manipulative and in disregard of boundaries I’ve set out over the years. I told him so and blocked him. I didn’t raise my voice and I wasn’t mean about it, but I was firm and didn’t hear “his side” (he seemed to feel the situation warranted what he did).

Now complete the following example-
input: So my little brother calls me 6 days before his wedding just to ""tell"" me about him having a wedding. He doesn't ask if I want to go, no invitation, nothing of the sort.

He says, ""Hey I'm getting married next Sunday and I just want to give you the heads up""! I promptly congratulate him and because it was a last minute notice, I assume that it's a simple courthouse marriage. However, I was startled when he says he's having a wedding... WTF right?

&amp;#x200B;

To add to that, he tells me it's on a whim because he's shipping out for the Air Force in 8 days and wants to get married right before going. He is doing it for the benefits as you get more going in married so I can understand all that.

He also adds that the bride's family wants something big for their daughter so that is why they are having a wedding. Again, I can understand the thing with the bride and her family, but why tell me just 6 days prior to? Is it actually possible to prepare a wedding that fast?

&amp;#x200B;

I would also like to add that I live overseas but very flexible so I can go to my brother's wedding even with the late notice, but as I continue to talk to my brother, the conversation is just chit-chat. Not once does he ask if I want to come. We chat for about an hour and the invite never came. So I got the message that I'm not invited.

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning, my mother calls and she tells me to just go. I'm reluctant but the benefits of going totally outweigh not going. So I go online and reserve a ticket. unfortunately, as I was reserving a ticket, I realized that my passport expired. How unlucky is that with just 5 days to go before the wedding!!! I'm pissed! 

Now I'm working on trying to renew my passport but it has to be a life or death emergency to get it renewed in a day. I even contacted an old colleague who works for the State Dept. but it doesn't look promising. 

&amp;#x200B;

As family, this whole thing with my brother telling me about the wedding last minute and not inviting me really upsets me? He and his fiance had to plan this ahead of time right? 

&amp;#x200B;

So, for the benefit of the doubt I bit the bullet and called him back and asked him directly if he actually wants me to go and he says yes.

I tell him, ""thank you for the invite, I wish you said that last night! Btw, my passport expired but I'm working on it"". He tells me that it's fine if I can't make it because it was so last minute. I reply, "" Yes it is last minute but it would have been so much better if you let me know about your wedding much earlier.""    

I didn't expect anything after saying that but I think that was the trigger that blew him up. He was yelling so much that I could not understand most of what he was saying. From this point on, it's a one way conversation of him bringing up past drama I don't even care about.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; so with just 6 days notice (5 days now) AITA for saying it would have been better if you let me know earlier?

input: I have been living in a student shared flat for about two and a half months now and There's eight of us total. One of the flatmates, Tim, never cleans up after himself. We've asked several times for him to clean up but he never does.

Even when he's thrown parties at our flat, everyone else cleans up after him (including my gf on a few occasions, who doesn't even live in the flat). This pattern has been going on for about two and a half months.

A few days ago, I threw away some alcohol (a quarter of a bottle of wine and a few cups of vodka between two different bottles) and some expired food that had been out for several days in direct sunlight. I decided to pour out the alcohol and put the bottles by the trashcan.

Today he asked me to pay him back almost full price for two of the bottles and full price for one of the bottles and for the expired food.

Am I the asshole? He has never cleaned before despite us asking and I was also very angry that my gf helped a few times.

input: Throwaway, because I am scared that anyone I know will read this. 

I live in a very quiet area and a year ago my neighbors moved in. It's a single mother with two children (a new one is coming this year). 

The children are sweethearts. I often meet them in the backyard. 

However, my problem starts here: the mom sent them outside without a jacket in winter and they stayed outside for 4 hours (because she got male visitors) She always screams at them for (often) no reason, like the boy touching the dog or stuff. It's very loud, neighbors two blocks away complained already. The mom often throws her trash and dog shit into the backyard - which we by the way share - and the staircase looks a bit like she's a horder. The girl had bruises on her arm and when I asked her she said she bumped her arm on a chair. Her male visitors are very aggressive too, I saw one of them scream at the children too. 

I feel like if I don't do anything the kids will get serious problems. I watched them play a game, named ""kill the cat"". We have a stray cat and she often comes to visit us and to get some food. She formerly was a cat of a granny that lived in our neighborhood too and since the granny passed, she strays around the neighborhood. The kids ran after the cat and wanted to catch her (to maybe beat her?). I told the mother and she just shrugged it off and said, that this is none of her business. 

Now, why anonymously? Because she got a letter by somebody in the neighborhood telling her not to scream till late nights and she rang the door of that neighbor like a maniac and threatened to beat the sh*t out of him. And I'm not good with confronting people. 

So, AITA if I call CPS on my neighbor anonymously?

Now complete the following example-
input: Backstory- 

I was with my grandfather at Walmart to pick up some random groceries when we realized that my grandpa forgot his phone at home which he needs since he has his own “taxi service.”

So, my grandpa tells me to call my brother to get his phone and tells him to tell anyone that calls to tell them that he’ll be there shortly and that he’s currently unavailable. My brother spends his days playing fortnite nonstop, and when I called him he was pissed at me for calling and said a few curse words and speaks to me in a mean kind of attitude. Still, I ask him and while he sounds hesitant and doesn’t want to do it, he does but hangs up before telling me. Note that before this successful call I called him once and told him to wait since i had to help my grandpa for a sec (he uses a cane but was using the Walmart electric scooters) and then he hangs up. Three calls later he ignores when I call my mom to tell him, again three more ignored calls (probably sleeping) and when I call my brother once more we have the interaction we had above.

Before Walmart we stopped by BK to pick up food, I pay and pick some stuff up for my brother as a surprise. He doesn’t know he’s getting food, but after he was being an asshole to me in the calls I decide he’s not getting his food and either give it to my grandma or eat it later in the day.

Once I get home, I help my grandpa unload the groceries and then bring my food. My brother did get the phone, but I told myself he wouldn’t get his food. So, once I get the phone I tell him something along the lines of “Because you were being an ass to me, you’re not getting food I picked you up,” (again note he didn’t know he’d be getting food)

Once that happens, he gets off the PS4 after 3 and a half hours and then goes to my moms room where I knew she’d take his side. She did, showing clear bias towards him (numerous times she’d tell us that we have to show each other respect each other, I felt really disrespected so I didn’t give him his food to tell him to not be like that) and here she again goes on a rant and tells me to respect my brother, even though I told her he was being an ass to me on the call and that I was proving a point. She said he was waiting for the food the whole time so either my brother lied to her or she’s making shit up, and when I tell her it was surprise food she then moves to a different point about respect again.

My brothers reason for not picking up and being mean? He was playing fortnite and said that he’d rather speak to them than wait fifteen seconds for me to finish helping my grandpa out, outright saying he didn’t care.

I’m sorry if this was confusing I’m just so mad about it, mom is pissed at me though I know my grandpa will take my side since he knew what was happening.

I have no idea why I did this, but without thinking, I replied “so is talking to strangers”. 

She threw a look and walked away. I have no idea why I said that, it just sort of came out without me consciously thinking about it. 

Some of my friends have said it was rude, but I considered it rude that she came all the way over to me, where I was minding my own business, in the designated smoking area, to inform me something that’s common knowledge, as if I’ve been living under a rock.

input: A friend of mine asked me to take pictures of her and her husband. 

I am trying to set up my business as a photographer and therefore money is tight for me. I have been taking photos for years so not a begginer photographer. I have been told for years to start a business. It costs money to store the pictures even if I don’t edit them. 

She asked me to take pictures and what’s the price. 

I said I couldn’t take money off a friend but to buy the backdrop for the photos. 

Which would cost 80% of the sitting fee    So I’d be out of pocket for 20%sitting fee and then I would edit all the photos and give high res. I wouldn’t do that for paying customers unless they paid well for it. 

Anyway she seems to be distant from me now. Did I do wrong to ask for the backdrop? I thought I was doing a favor but also helping me too. I don’t exactly have time to edit over 50 photos for free and I didn’t buy my camera and photoshop to do free shoots for everyone. 

Should I have done it for free? Or just said my full price. Am u the ass for suggesting the backdrop? 

Tl:dr: friend asked me to take photos. Asked what the price is. Total price for all pictures (over 50) would be 400dollars   Offered her to buy backdrop (80dollars). She is now distant from me.

input: I’ll start from the beginning. We’ll call him Noah. So, N and I have been in the same choir for half a year. Because we’ve had hours upon hours to be around each other, we’d become close friends. 

Then, about a month ago, Noah texts me, saying something along the lines of “Thank you for being such a good friend to me, don’t let anyone change who you are, goodbye.” As it would any friend, this message extremely worried me. Long story short, I called the police, they went to his house, and found he had taken a bunch of pills. They took him to the hospital and saved his life.

Now, about a week or two ago, Noah asks me out, and I say yes. Truth be told, I had started to like him about a month before the incident. We start dating, and all is going well. Until he texts me that this girl he knew (we’ll call her Nadine) texted him that if he didn’t date her, she was going to kill herself. To me, this sounded like obvious manipulation. I’m still not sure whether he actually didn’t see it, or just didn’t care, but Noah (after relating to me what had happened) asked me if we could go on a break (so he could date her). He also says that he likes her. Slightly annoyed, I said, in *the* most passive aggressive tone, “sure”.

Fast forward to last Thursday. It’s the night of our concert, so, instead of going home for the day like usual at 3:30, we stay to prepare for the concert at 7:00. Other than the choir Noah and I are in, there are two other choirs, and we’ll all perform together for the concert. In one of the choirs is a guy I also like. We’ll call him Sean. Note that Sean and Noah are friends. 

Our choir director orders a pizza to arrive at 5:30. At 5:00, we finish practice/preparation, and have a bit of free time. The cafeteria is full, so Sean, Noah, and a few of our other friends go sit at one of the outside tables. I had forgotten my jacket (note that *everyone* else is wearing a jacket), and it was really cold, so I was freezing. After sitting there shivering for a minute or two, Sean takes off his jacket and offers it to me. 

Noah says “If you put that on, we’re done.”

So I put it on!

What do you guys think? AITA?

Tldr; Friend tries to kill himself, we start dating, he wants to take a break to date a different girl who threatened to kill herself if he didn’t date her. Him, a different guy, and I are outside and I’m freezing, so the different guy offers me his jacket. Then he says if I put on other guy’s jacket, “we’re done,” so I put it on.

Now complete the following example-
input: Oh GOD ok I have no idea what kind of reaction I’m going to get. Sorry about the formatting, I’m on mobile. And sorry if it’s super long, I have some pent up frustration!

So here is some background: I am a 19F Asian-American college student. My family is Indian. My parents immigrated to America shortly before I was born. I have lived in the New England area my entire life. I’ve been with my 19F boyfriend for almost 3 years (anniversary in April, yay!) and things are actually quite serious. We love each other a lot and have a plan for our future. My bf is actually not originally from the New England area, but from Georgia. He asked me to travel to Georgia for our week long spring break in March (we go to the same college) with him and his parents to meet the rest of his family. I really want to go, but here is the issue. 

My parents 100% disapprove of me traveling with a boyfriend. My moms exact words are: “Only trashy girls travel with their boyfriends.” Every time I hear that I roll my eyes as hard as I can. My parents  grew up in India in the 80’s, so I know it’s a cultural issue. But that statement upsets me because so many people I know travel with their boyfriends. Here are some other reasons they have given for not wanting me to go on the trip, kind of jumbled up into one paragraph:

I am too young to be in such a serious relationship. They are uncomfortable with how serious the relationship is. They don’t want me to travel with my boyfriend. What would their friends and family think of them? They think if I spend my spring break on vacation it means I am not focused on my studies. I am not an adult in their eyes and they can’t trust me (with what exactly I’m not sure). 

I want to say that I’m not an entitled kid. I’m simply not. I think about my parents’ feelings a lot before I ask to go anywhere or do anything. Up until a couple of weeks ago, my curfew was 9:30 pm, and my parents were slowly decreasing it to 9 pm, then 8:30. I finally negotiated 11:30, which I think is completely fair (NOTE: I don’t come home at 11:30 every night! I come home more around 9:30 or 10 anyway so that THEY can feel better about me being outside the house and so I can demonstrate that I am a responsible and conscientious person like I tell them I am. 11:30 is the time I absolutely have to be home, no matter what). I do what they ask and I always put their feelings first. If they are not comfortable with me going to a bar, for example, even if I promise not to drink, I just won’t go—even though I am 19 and could get into some of the bars in my home town. I do a lot to appease them because they are my parents, and I love them and respect their wishes. 

On this issue, I feel they are wrong. It would be a 5 day trip with my bf’s PARENTS. We’d be staying at his grandma’s house in separate rooms. I understand their discomfort as parents. I really do. This is new territory for them and I get that. But I feel that their reasoning is flawed, and this has been one of the only times I have questioned their verdict. My reasons for wanting to go are simple: I’ve never been to Georgia; I want to meet my boyfriend’s family; and my next opportunity to go won’t be for years as my bf and I are both pre-med and want to spend the rest of our semesters focusing 100% on studies. My parents a) do not believe that I want to go to Georgia for myself (they think I only want to go to please my boyfriend...) and b) think for some reason that my studies/ focus on my studies will be greatly impacted by this trip. It’s a vacation like any other. Would my studies be impacted if they brought me on a week long trip? Only as much as if I went on the trip to Georgia!

I plan on trying to get their blessing to go one more time, but if it doesn’t work, I plan on just giving them the heads up and going anyway. I know if I do this I will never hear the end of it for the rest of my life, so I am scared. But I am 19. I spend 5 days a week at school, and I study for the MCAT 5-6 hours every day WHILE studying for my other classes! I also manage to make time for clubs, the gym, and my lovely boyfriend. I would love to get this vacation in while I am still able to. I have tried giving in and telling my bf I can’t go, but he knows I really want to and is encouraging me to stand up for myself. My parents view him as very mature and wise beyond his years (which he is), so I am going to include him in my last plea when I sit to talk with my parents. Hopefully he can reassure them that it’s not as big a deal as they think it is. 

Note: my parent’s “blessing”/ permission to go is important to me because I seek their approval and I don’t want them to be mad at me about this. I can’t quite explain it, but I know Asian-American children of immigrants will definitely understand. I know plenty of other people understand as well lol, but all my Indian friends have similar relationships with their parents and similar expectations placed upon them, so I listed Asian-American children of immigrants for reference only!

Other very important note: I am paying for my expenses myself! I have a job. I will pay for my plane ticket, food, activities, everything. They are not contributing money for this trip. 

So reddit, if I go to Georgia with my boyfriend after my parents say no (if they say no), WIBTA? I will be consulting r/relationships again as well to prepare myself for any fallout from this (unless, of course, I and up being the asshole). If anyone is interested, I have a post about this situation on my profile if I left anything out or you are simply curious.

Thank you for your time and consideration, everyone!

So, I fished through my purse for quarters, put some toilet paper in place, and quickly sprinted over to the Cotton Apparatus Dispenser and dialed up a solution.

Seeing as how I was only half zipped and in distress, I ducked into the handicapped stall to insert said apparatus. You guessed in - - in the literally 30 seconds I was in there, she showed up and started yelling at me that I was thoughtless and entitled. There was no room to interject ""30 seconds"" or ""emergency"" or ""you weren't even here.""

Am I the asshole? Is it never allowable to use that stall if you are not disabled?

input: I (a college student) recently met someone I have many mutual friends with, and I thought he was extremely attractive.  We hooked up on two separate weekends, and we both said we really would like to get to know each other better, so it seemed like more than physical at least from my side. Later he tells me he didn’t mean for things to go so far, and that he is “on a break” with a girl. He acts very regretful and somewhat shameful, but says we should keep hanging out. The relationship is scheduled to restart this week.  I also just found out that he previously cheated on his high school girlfriend at the beginning of college. 

We have a lot of friends in common and I don’t want to ruin possible tight friendships of his.  I have never spoken to the girl, AITA for not telling her?

Note: this is ongoing so I still have the choice

input: Basically to lay the groundwork for the story I have to say that work for a recreational facility that hosts group retreats and the like— but it’s a full year 24/7 facility so a lot of us choose to live in staff housing on the premises to make our lives (and commutes) that much each easier.

I had a coworker who was in charge of what we call the “challenge” components of our facility. This is stuff like a rock wall, a zip line, a giant swing— things of that nature. Last year she got injured and wasn’t able to really do the main part of her job which involves upkeep, staff training, and teaching these activities to people that come to us—  because of this her relationship with upper management became strained because she was living on the grounds but not really able to assist with what was her job (we have a small 5-15 person crew so this was a massive pain in the ass) 

The relationship became so strained that recently, after multiple blow ups with upper management and the staff, they decided to let her go. (All of this was done legally) As she was packing up she handed me a laptop that belongs to the company that she claims she was holding onto because she found it lying around and didn’t want anyone to steal it— though the laptop has been missing for months and she never mentioned a word about it before that moment. She asked me to sneak it back into the office so that no one knew that she had it. 

The next morning I walked into the office and placed it on my boss’s desk, telling her how and where I found it, ratting her out about everything with the laptop— and they were fucking pissed. 

We were friends before she started spiraling at work and I feel kinda bad that I did that, though the people I’ve talked to told me it was justified because I didn’t want to get implicated in the situation later on down the line.

input: (First off sorry for formatting, mobile)

My girlfriend and I have rekindled our relationship recently after hitting a rough patch. She has her friends and I have mine and to get to the point, we are both in the band at the college (she's in the color guard) . And for those who don't know we band nerds change all the time together. The color guard changes separate and together as they are all made up of females. 

Yesterday after my classes I was in one the band room's practice rooms, catching up on some work. When a friend of mine ,(we'll call her J) who is also in the guard and knows my gf, walks in and asks to change in there, to which i say yes. As I'm gathering my things in my pack she starts taking her clothes off. I then just grab my phone and leave my stuff there. 

J then says ""you didn't have to leave""

To which I respond ""it's a matter of respect""

This small incident made me feel uncomfortable. So I did what I normally do. I talk to my girlfriend,(in this class text) I like to be transparent about everything with her.  She then takes this information and cold shoulders me, and just doesn't talk to me. I try to give her space, and she tells me how she feels after an evening with no communication.  I tell her I understand but I didn't like that she took her anger out on me. She tells me that I dont understand how she feels and that I'm being insensitive and I should just forget about it and it shouldn't be a big deal. And our conversation ends.

I saw her on campus today, frustrated, we talk some more about it and I tell her that it's not right  that shes talking her frustration out on me when I came for help. And I dont see this as something that put our relationship progress back. And she then said I clearly dont understand, it would be the last time she came to me about problems. I then said that's shes in the wrong, I can understand jealousy or J being disrespectful to us, but it's not right to take it out on me, and the strain of the relationship that is happening right now comes from her, and that she is being the problem instead of dropping it like she said to. I can be kind and understanding but this is ridiculous.

AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input:   

I go to school a few hours away from home and am graduating with my master’s this May. So, a lot of my family who're coming up for the commencement need a place to stay for a night or two. So far everyone who's coming up is just getting a hotel, but then the other day my mom decided to inform me she was staying at my place instead of a hotel. Now, I in general was not crazy about her staying over. Sometimes if a friend needs a place to crash after we've been drinking or something it's not a big deal but having my mom (and probably my sister) stay over in my one bedroom apartment and then having the potentially three of us getting ready on top of each other in my one small bathroom does not sound like a good time. I didn't completely rule it out yet though because I don't want to be unreasonable. But then she told me, as in did not ask, that because her back isn't great she'd also need to take my bed and I'd have to take the couch. This is when I told her I wasn’t doing that. 

I am not crazy about the idea at all, but even more than that I really think it's rude how she just straight up told me that this was the plan instead of asking me if it was alright. I would have strongly considered it if she'd just asked me too. Money is tight, so I get she doesn't want to spend it on a hotel for the weekend (they don't let you buy just one night during commencement) but I don't think that entitles her to my bed or even my apartment necessarily. I also really don't care much about the actual commencement ceremony. I'm just doing it because my family wants me to. So, it's not like it's some big thing she's bending over backward to do just for me either. If I'm doing it, it'd be nice for her to be there, but I'd be just as happy not going to the ceremony and seeing everyone a few days later when I came home anyway. She feels it's normal for a son to make sacrifices for his mother and thinks she shouldn't even have to ask me to do this, but I think that's absurd for her to just assume. I don't mind making sacrifices and helping when I can, but I think she's being unfair this time. No one else's parents are even asking to stay in their apartment, and even when my dad (who actually helps pay for my rent since I'm still in school) came up, he at least stayed on my couch (which was also after I offered once he said he was thinking of coming, he didn't have to ask).

My mom and I normally have a good relationship, and realistically it's probably settled since my grandpa was there and told me (after she'd gone to the bathroom, so she doesn't know yet) that he'd just get her a hotel room. But she seemed almost surprised this was an issue, and I'm really shocked she didn't understand how I had a problem with what she was demanding and the way she did it. So, I wanted to check. Am I being an asshole here, or is she really being a bit unreasonable.

Now complete the following example-
input: For some background, I have been dating my girlfriend for about a year and a half.

It was my girlfriend's birthday on Friday. I had planned to suprise her that night with a dinner and cake at my place. She got off work early that day, and had made plans to catch up with one of her friends for a coffee to celebrate her birthday before coming over to my place. Her friend (who I will call Ally) was one of her longtime closest friends who now lives on the other side of the country for work, meaning they don't see each other very often.

Now I am not close to Ally, nor do I know her very well, but I have spoken to her before while they were on Skype, and she definitely knows that my girlfriend and I are together. Anyway, I am sitting at home on her birthday a few hours before she is coming over, and I get a text from her saying that she probably won't be able to make it to my place because Ally had organised a suprise birthday dinner for her.

Now I was a little annoyed since I had already bought the stuff to make dinner, but I hadn't cooked anything yet so no big deal. I texted back asking her what time everyone was getting there, and she said everyone was already there and it had already started. I said I would come and join them for dinner and she said that the reservation was only enough for the people who RSVP'd. I told her I hadn't heard about it which is why I didn't RSVP. I figured it could have just been a miscommunication, so I asked her to check with Ally.

I already know I'm probably an asshole for prodding as to why I didn't get invited, but I was just feeling a bit frustrated. A while later in the evening she texted me back that Ally didn't think to invite me because she doesn't really know me well and the dinner was supposed to be more of a get together of their old girl friends group from school. I was still a little annoyed that I had an evening organised, but I felt better knowing that it was more of a get together for her friends group.

I told her to have fun and arranged to meet her the next day to bring her birthday cake over. I didn't hear from her the rest of the night, so I texted her in the morning to ask how her night was. She said it was fun and that Ally would be joining us today for cake. I asked who ended being at the dinner. I was pretty upset to find out that on top of her old friends group, all of their partners attended the dinner, including Ally's fiance. 

Even more upsetting she said that one of her friends boyfriend who originally couldn't make it arrived later in the evening, and the server squeezed in an extra chair for them at the table. I asked why she didn't let me know when she saw this so I could come, and she said she just 'forgot'.

At this point I was pretty upset and I bailed on plans to see her that day. Mostly because I was angry at Ally for not telling me and I didn't want to talk to her, but also because I was upset at my girlfriend for not seeming to care that I wasn't there. I ended up eating most of the cake I made for her out of spite, which I feel bad about and know I shouldn't have done that.

We haven't really spoken much at all since yesterday, as she is spending today with Ally again before she fly's home. I am still feeling bad for bailing on her and eating the cake without her, and I might end up making her a new one. But at the same time I feel so annoyed that I was seemingly purposely not told about her party. This may be me sounding entitled but if anyone should have their SO invited to a suprise party it should be the birthday girl, and I kind of expect I should have been invited considering everyone else's partners got invited.

Am I the asshole?

tl;dr: Girlfriend had a suprise birthday dinner thrown for her and I wasn't invited, even though everyone else's partners were invited. Am I the asshole for expecting I should have been invited?

UPDATE 1: We have been texting each other and I told her I have been upset with the whole birthday situation. Ally and her fiance have gone back home and my girlfriend and I have agreed to meet up tomorrow sometime to talk things out

UPDATE 2: Sorry for the delayed update, was meaning to post it and I forgot.

I met up with my gf and we had a serious discussion about things. I told her I was not upset about her cancelling our plans for her birthday, I am upset about not being invited or informed by Ally, and I am quite hurt that she didn't seem to care that I wasn't there.

She agreed that Ally should have included me but defends her actions because she doesn't really know me and she already knows most of her other friends partners from school and before she moved away.

I told her I was upset because she didn't want me the there. She denied it and said she would have wanted me there but she felt it wasn't her place to go making demands at a party that was organised for her. she admitted she lied about forgetting to text me when the other guy showed up late because she was nervous about upsetting Ally and coming off as ungrateful.

I told her that it hurt me because I felt like I was unwanted at the party by everyone there, and that if she considers us a serious relationship I expect to at least be invited to these types of events that are special to her. She said she does consider us a serious relationship with a future together but did not realise something like this was such a big deal to me, and has promised moving forward to put me first in situations like this. I know she is particularly close to Ally so I can understand why she might have got all wrapped up with spending time with her.

I feel a lot better have talking it out with her, and I trust her so I believe that she means what she said. That said, the responses in this post pointed out some signs to look out for, and I will be keeping an eye out for any more of these in the future. I am optimistic that she truly means what she said and I believe if a situation like this happens in the future she would handle things differently. I am looking forward to continuing to build a future with her.

Thanks everyone for the responses.

input: A few days ago I was about to enter my tuition class. As I was at the door I saw that my friend’s table was blocking the door (it had a window above half of the door so that I can see what’s blocking the door). I pushed the door a little and my Friend didn’t move his table, so I pushed the door harder and the door opened, which also caused his table to move aside. But suddenly I heard something fell, it was his phone. I helped him pick his phone up and then I went to my seat in class.

When tuition ended, I went to my Friend to see if his phone was okay and saw a cracked corner on the front glass of the phone. I felt sorry so I said that I would pay for the damages. And for a few days after that I thought that it was my fault.

Yesterday I asked him for the repairment fee and he said 900 dollars. I was like, 900 dollars for replacing the front glass?! Then he said I only had to pay 400 dollars, he also stated that his dad was furious about it. This led me to think if it was actually my fault that I broke his phone. We quarrelled through Messenger and both of us exchanged arguments on why I should/shouldn’t pay for the fee.

My points for defending were:
1. I didn’t know/saw his phone was on the table
2. Why was he blocking the door in the first place (after I said this he then stated that he didn’t know that he was blocking the door, which honestly just sounds idiotic)
3. The repairment fee could not be that high. His phone is a Samsung S6 Edge, and the only thing that needs replacing is the front glass

I have not given my money yet, because I’m not sure if it’s entirely my fault or not. Please help!

Tonight, M and I made brownies, and I decided we’d go bring a brownie to our mutual friend, V [21M], who lives on our floor. V wasn’t there, so we gave a brownie to his roommate to give to him later. Before the roommate closed the door, M asked “Did you know herpes has the same letters as sphere?” We figured that fun fact out when she was playing that word scramble game and it was kinda funny but I was mortified that she’s just say that to some guy we don’t even know.

We went back to our place, and for more context my other roommate B [20F] and I share a room while M has the other to herself. We go into my room to give B a brownie and M and I tell her what happened with V’s roommate.

B couldn’t believe M would say that and she understood why I was embarrassed. M didn’t, and she demanded why I was embarrassed because I “wasn’t even there” (I was a few feet down the hallway when she said it.) I told her he’d just seen me so I know I was there and would probably think of herpes whenever he saw either of us around the building.

M said “Oh, so you’re embarrassed to be associated with me?” This entire time I thought it was just lighthearted joking about the awkward conversation, and I responded jokingly “Only when you talk about herpes to guys we don’t even know!”

This set M over the edge, and she yelled something I can’t remember at me and B and stormed out of our room and into hers, slamming both doors. This is where we’re at right now. I put a couple brownies on a napkin and set them in front of her door and knocked before going back to my room, but she didn’t open her door and they’re still sitting out there.

I understand I overreacted. I was kind of irrationally embarrassed by the whole thing, and I didn’t realize she was upset by B and I jokingly exaggerating it like she’d done something awful. But she gave no sign that she was upset before running off and slamming our door.

I also have an anxiety disorder and often get nervous talking to strangers, which M knows. She said she was going to ask V if he knew that herpes and sphere are spelled with the same letters, and I thought she was probably kidding but still told her not to, although I know V better than she does and he’d probably just laugh, so I wouldn’t have really minded. I had no reason to suspect she’d say it to his roommate, we don’t even know the guy’s name.

TLDR: My roommate asked a guy on our floor who neither of us knew if he knew that herpes and sphere are spelled with the same letters, I told her afterward I was embarrassed because I was there too. She took this to mean I was embarrassed to be associated with her, even though I said it was just her talking about herpes, and now she’s locked herself in her room. AITA?

input: My mother has had ALS for 15 years, and most of the care for her was done by me and my dad. Recently, however, my dad was arrested for abuse and he has completely left our household. We had a hard time with that whole ordeal but now we have quality care for her where all I do now is having to be in the house during sleeping hours so she doesn't suffocate in her sleep or anything. This also means that I put her to bed every night with the exception of when I go out and ask a caregiver to do it. Every night I put her to bed (around 10:15 PM) we always talk about something, usually about my college and work. Over the years it has usually been fine, because before I got a job I was fine with five hours of sleep at night before I went to school. Now though there doesn't seem to be anything worth talking about right at night time that we cant talk about any other time, and I really value my sleep especially since I have sleeping issues. Now I end up trying to get out of our conversation so I can go to bed but she always calls me back and tries to bring the subject back up and I get heated. The most recent discussion I tried to get out of I tried talking about my dad leaving and how if we don't have a stable way to take care of her for the long term, she would have to go to a home. This wasn't anything new and it was a branch from me talking about the good things my dad did for her, because she thought he didn't do anything good for us. I just don't know what the right call is to make because I don't want to talk to her at night time. I honestly just want to sleep but she always gets on me about things that I don't want to talk about like my relationships and what I talk to my friends about. I end up arguing with her almost every night and she ends up crying most of the time, but I don't feel bad for it because I feel like I should be able to talk to my mom about how I feel about things.

Now complete the following example-
input: So about 5 years ago, my niece came to visit us. This was really exciting for her because she was 14 and she was finally allowed to travel on her own. Her mom, my older sister, is a single mom who struggles to get by (barely paycheck to paycheck), so it was our treat and pleasure. We also happened to have a new rambunctious puppy at the time. We reminded my niece multiple times to put her valuables away and to push in chairs, etc, but our puppy ultimately ended up eating her retainer. I immediately told my sister that we would pay for it, since it was a slight hardship for us (~$400-600, can’t remember, but they had no dental insurance) but would have been a devastating blow to my sister. My wife (then GF) grumbled a little about how my niece wasn’t responsible with her belongings even after multiple warnings (she left retainer on table with chair pulled out, a specific scenario we warned about) but ultimately conceded that it was our puppy, our home, and therefore our responsibility.

Anyway, when we were home visiting for Thanksgiving, my wife came to our room (really niece’s room that we’re staying in) to find that my sister’s dog had torn up her suitcase and destroyed most of the clothes she brought and all of her cosmetics. My wife is into fashion, so this is totalling around $800ish damage. The dog had jumped over the gate my sister put up.

This would be, again, a devastating financial blow to my sister. It wouldn’t be easy to replace ourselves but we could manage to do it, especially over time. Get the most crucial stuff now and fill in. That to me seemed like the best solution, but my wife is throwing my old logic back in my face: my sister’s dog, her roof, her responsibility. And she is saying that since my sister put up a gate, giving her a false sense of security, it’s even more crucial since she wasn’t “irresponsible” like my (at the time young teen) niece was. AND she wanted to stay at a hotel anyway, but my sister would have been hurt if we did that so she had already compromised there (this is true). I get all this and I’ve validated my wife’s frustration but I still don’t want to ask my sister to give us money she definitely doesn’t have when she’s raising a daughter and struggles to barely make ends meet. 

It doesn’t help that my wife and my sister aren’t each other’s biggest fans for a lot of other reasons but I think that’s fuel more than fire.

AITA? Or is my wife thinking too black and white?

Now complete the following example-
input: So my ""best"" friend (lets call her Em) and I are both in the same veterinary program (were both 21 F). The instructors sometimes assign us to do some extra duties for our facility like laundry, office duties, and cleaning. I've had a really rough week. I learned over the weekend that one of my family friends was in the hospital with 4th stage cancer that had spread to her brain. To make my situation worse, my sick friend was in the palliative care unit at the hospital where my mother works (who frequently visits her as well). I haven't spoken to my mother in 2 years since I ran away from her abuse and manipulation. So I was in a really stressful spot as I planned my visit to the hospital. I had two very embarrassing breakdowns at school this week, and ""Em"" saw them both. My instructors recommended I take some time off to gather myself, and I took that recommendation and took the week off. ""Em"" on the other hand lives at home with her father who loves her unconditionally. I really wish she would understand how great that is. I don't have that kind of luxury. Because of my living situation I obviously qualify for financial aid...but she complains when she doesn't receive financial aid even though its for people who really desperately need it. She seems to complain at petty things- the fact that she cant get A+ in all her courses (she only gets A's), how stressed she is that the program is unorganized, how she thinks the instructors/classmates hate her. In my eyes, its petty. But as a friend I never tell her that. I just sympathize. Even when its not genuine. I understand its not fair to compare our problems, so that's why I don't say anything. But its hard for me not feel annoyed. SO anyways. Both Em and I were assigned cleaning duties this week. I wasn't in school this week, and I figured that since my best friend Em knows what I'm going through, she would be happy to cover for me and do my part (which isn't much work, just some light cleaning and restocking of items). Right? Wrong. I know my friend is bad in helping me emotionally through my problems, cause she just doesn't understand the pain of most of my situations, but she was actually pissed at me for not helping her clean. like actually so pissed. She even said shes not going to help me in a video assignment we agreed to help eachother in.. She flat out said ""TBH, I dont want to help you"". She also said ""We're all going through stuff."" Correct. Everyone is going through stuff, but I figured as my best friend she wouldn't mind cleaning knowing I was having a really rough week at home. I don't feel like the asshole. But shes making me think I should be. Am I the asshole? Any advice on a situation like this?

Now complete the following example-
input: My friend and I have know each other for several years and he is now in his early thirties. Years ago, he decided not to finish his university education, which has unfortunately accumulated a lot of student loan debt for the classes he did take. He has since then been trapped in a low-paying job with bad prospects, which he despises. I really care about him as a friend and have always tried to help him out any way I can including job hunting and financial advice. 

Since last year, he has been caught up in a multi-level marketing scheme. His “uplines” have charged him over $3000 for the “opportunity” to sell water ionizer machines that cost thousands of dollars to people on social media. He has not been able to recoup a single dollar after many months and his total loss out of pocket due to involvement with them is probably $5000.

Despite this, he continues to be invested in this scheme, which would be due to charge him the same amount again this year. I have, in my attempt to stop him from continuing in this scheme, suggested to him many times to look for a higher paying opportunity or even have his employer help with getting better certifications. I sent him a lot of job postings, and he would respond that he never wants to work for a boss again, and that people who work for companies are obtuse conformists who can’t think out of the box. 

It came to a head yesterday when he told me his debt repayment had been hiked up by the lender which makes it hard for him to pay his bills on his current salary. When he told me this, I said: “if you don’t want to get a better paying job right now, why not look into Uber? It can help you make a plan because the earnings are not huge but pretty stable (we live in a big city where earnings are more predictable) and you can earn around your hours.” 

He replied: “Uber is just a dead end job, I would not make any job where I had to answer to someone else my priority. I need to focus on (the mlm scheme) until I can pay my debt off at once.” 

At this point I felt a bit angry and said : “no, you need a budget plan, because you’ll never get rich off this, it’s a total scam, you know that right? They are looking to scam you and you are brainwashed into trying to scam other people.”

He was very upset by this and responded that I am being unsupportive of his entrepreneurial-ship. I said being a distributor for an MLM was not being an entrepreneur because the business doesn’t belong to him, and that his focus should be to pay off debt instead of get rich quick schemes with con artists. 

His response was that I was being a terrible unsupportive friend, and that I am acting this way because I can’t stand to see him “woke” and knowing what he wants in life and that I am trying to ruin what he believes in. He has since blocked me on text. 

Was I an asshole for this exchange? Am I a bad friend for causing hurt because I feel that he’s wrecking his life? 

If so, what should I have done? 

Thanks for reading all this.

Now complete the following example-
input: So I was driving to school, and I was stuck in traffic behind an L300. The L300 in front of me suddenly braked, so I stepped on my brakes as well. There was about 10 feet of distance between our vehicles, so everything was good. But a six-wheeler truck hit my car from behind, and my car, being a smol (Toyota Wigo to be exact), despite being on the brakes, went sorta flying and ended up hitting the L300 in front of me- all of this resulting in a \_pwingle sandwich. 

Of course, I'm a reasonable person so I got out of the car to discuss damages with everyone involved. I'm pretty young, I'm like 20, so my first instinct is to call my mom and my insurance. 

The lady (who looked about 40) who was riding shotgun in the L300 got out of the car, and started accusing me of not having a license- but demanded my car papers (like car receipt, registration). 

I mean, I look pretty young, aside from my actual age, I'm Asian so... you get it. I was pretty shaken up of course, and I just tried to calm things down.  

In response to her asking for my papers, I asked for the license of her driver, as well as her vehicle's papers, all those documents, because the insurance does need that stuff. I didn't show her my papers until she would show me hers, for my own safety (which she did not, as you'll see later. She also refused to see my license). I did give my contact details, because I was still being amicable at this point, and of course, nobody wanted this kind of thing to happen. 

I was also trying to get the police (who did not show up), because I am clueless with regards to these things. I was also scared, given that there were drivers, who are big dudes and I'm kinda petite at 5""2. 

She lost her shit when I asked for her papers, she just started yelling at me for not having an actual license (which I repeatedly offered to present to her). I tried to tell her that I'd like to rewind the dashcam, because the truck driver had admitted that the impact was actually on him, but she was not having it, and just yelling at me nonstop for not having a license. I tried to get the details of her driver, but yeah that was a no too. 

She then tried to get me to cash out, and pay what is more or less $20 USD (which is pretty big, where I'm from). I refused, because my insurance covers these kinds of things, and it seemed reasonable to me to want to go through legal channels. She was really not having any of it, goddamn. The only thing she cooperated with was giving me her number, and she used a pen with almost no ink- and it was not legible at all. I'm staring at the paper now, and honestly even if I wanted to call her and work something out, this crappy note does not allow for it. 

I lost patience- my car is somewhat new, I needed it for my boyfriend's birthday surprise next week, and my torso hurt like hell, and of course *RIP MY CAR* and this bitch was just not having any of me trying to be reasonable. 

I lost my shit- I'm usually a bitchy person, and I'm honestly surprised that I managed to stay nice for that long. I started yelling at her like ""how am I supposed to have my insurance cover this if you won't show me the documents my insurance needs????"" and ""I am talking to your properly, how are we supposed to do this properly if you aren't even talking to me properly????"". 

She asked me if I was yelling, and why I'm being so rude if it was my fault. And I was like IT'S NOT MY FAULT OKAY, WE CAN CHECK THE VIDEO. And she refused, yet *again*. So I just checked her details which she had written down, and discovered that it was unreadable. So I asked her to rewrite it so I could get in contact with her. So she did that, while muttering all the while about disrespectful brats. 

I checked the paper which she had written on, and it was still not readable. While I was doing that, the L300 had sped off. So now, I don't have a way to contact the owners of the L300 to help with the damages on their vehicle, and quite frankly, I don't really plan to. 

Note: Where I live, it's a big cultural no-no to show *any* kind of disrespect towards elders. Even breathing the wrong way is already bad. And I technically did hit the L300. 

So am I the asshole here for any of the aforementioned reasons (or maybe any reasons I didn't point out)?

Now complete the following example-
input: tldr: Two guys started a brawl at my local pub and really violently attacked my boyfriend just for trying to break it up while wearing their company’s logo and at the marina where they work. WIBTA if I told their employer about it?

Here’s the story: Was at the pub last night with my boyfriend and a friend of a friend. It’s a pretty casual place, the local pub near a marina, we were playing that phone head game with our servers and having a few drinks. We were sitting at the bar and two guys who work for a company at the marina, who are known for being notorious assholes, were sitting at a table sorta close to us. They were yelling shit and being obnoxious and super rude throughout the whole night. Making fun of us for the game and whatever. It doesn’t really bother me, I don’t care what they think, but I can tell the friend of a friend is getting annoyed. 

A little bit later the guys start yelling more shit to the friend of a friend, making fun of what he’s wearing etc. He’s sort of a hippy looking guy; he’s wearing a colourful toque. The final straw I guess was them making fun of said hat, and when they asked where he got it, he said it was his dead grandfather’s toque, at which point they say something along the lines of “good, your grandpa was probably a f*g”

Well the friend of a friend loses his shit at this and stomps over to this guy and drags him to the ground. The other guy leaps up and the three of them are fighting now. The two female servers jump in and are trying to pull them apart, my boyfriend is sort of just watching trying to figure out how to help and decides to reach in to help the girls separate the guys and get them off of each other. 

Well, the guy my boyfriend grabbed suddenly thinks he’s trying to get in on the fight and he slams him to the ground, gets on top of him and shoves his fucking fingers in his eyes. I was staying out of it until now, but I got really scared so I leapt up and was trying to pull this guy off my boyfriend (who wasn’t even fighting back) and this guy changes from stabbing him the eyes to wrapping his hands around my boyfriend’s neck and so now I’m like totally freaking out, screaming and yanking on this guy to get him off. At the same time, the other sever gets the other two guys to break apart and I guess they see me and the other server trying to pull him off and so he like leaps on him to get him off and at that point everyone is finally stopped fighting. Me and the other girls are standing in between the guys, trying to keep it that way. The servers yell at the three guys to get out. The friend of a friend who started it goes and stands at the door, says he will leave, he just needs his hat and his phone. I hand them to him, he leaves. The other two guys are now screaming and yelling with the servers about how it’s not their fault and why should they have to leave an the servers are like “just get the fuck out!”

Well, they still don’t leave. My boyfriend is trying to calm the situation, and the guy who fucking attacked him comes over and apologizes. I guess he realizes my boyfriend wasn’t trying to fight him and my boyfriend just says like “it’s fine just like, not sure why you felt it necessary to stab your fingers in my eyes”. He apologized a bunch more times and pays for our bill. We’re offering to leave too but the servers were feeling pretty scared of the two guys so they asked us to stay just as back up until they leave. But the one guy who started the whole thing is just sitting at the table staring down the servers, demanding an apology. And they are just like what the fuck.

Someone in the kitchen called the cops while this was all going on and one of the girls talks to them and then calls the manager, who says he’s on his way in. Finally the two guys leave, and the girls lock up and my boyfriend and I head home.

My boyfriend is fine, has a black eye but isn’t seriously hurt or anything, but I’m just so mad and shocked that someone would resort to something so violent. And not only that, but they were wearing company sweaters at the bar near where they work. 

I really, really want to contact the company and tell them what happened, and how they initiated this brawl and responded so atrociously violent. My question is, would that make me the asshole? Should I just leave it alone since no one got seriously hurt? The two guys will most likely be barred from the pub by the manager, so it’s not like we’ll see them again, and my boyfriend seems pretty over it but I’m just still feeling really shook about it.

in no way did i ask, imply or anything like that for her to invite me, i even said ""oh no, you dont need to invite me we just met!"" but she insisted she wanted me to come &amp; tbh, i dont have many friends, i love dress up parties &amp; its just another excuse to hang out with my friend &amp; meet new people (im 25 if this makes a difference)

obviously i told my friend &amp; shes been acting weird about it. like when i asked her what she was dressing up as, she was like ""oh i didnt know you were coming, thats fair"" etc and is kinda just avoiding the topic. our other friend also got invited &amp; as far as im aware, theres no issue with her going.

AITA for going to this party? am i overstepping a boundary im not aware of or something?

Now complete the following example-
input: While the issues I'm gonna tell you about have been resolved, I'm unsure if I was in the wrong here and this situation is still messing with me. I have trouble judging what's socially acceptable sometimes, so if you decide to comment, please explain things so that even a robot could understand.

So there I was in my early 20s, a young woman with very few friends, only one of which lived near me. Let's call her Karen. Karen wasn't a close friend of mine. I always saw her getting into some kind of drama with one of her 100 ""besties"". Against my better judgement, I hung out with her. Through her, I got to know a dude she'd been friends with since kindergarten. At the time he was in a relationship with one of Karen's close friends.

Dude and I became friends. I found him attractive but obviously didn't wanna mess up anyone's relationship, so I was really careful to not overstep my boundaries and kept things strictly platonic.

A couple of months later though, dude's girlfriend breaks up with him and tells him she simply doesn't love him anymore. Meanwhile, dude and I have become pretty close friends. So when he tells me what happened I did what every good friend does. I listened to him when he needed someone to talk to, tried to cheer him up, and invited him out to get away from their shared apartment to get his mind off things.

We quickly realized that we had feelings for one another. Things moved fast; too fast. He hadn't had time to get over his ex and I was an inexperienced fool. We had only been a thing for about two or three weeks and he broke up with me. Of course he needed space. I was devastated.

Then I got a text from Karen. She was livid. How could I have dated one of her friends and not tell her?! So soon after the two of her friends had broken up, no less! She was disappointed in me, she thought we were friends. She was entitled to know about it.

All I could manage to say was that I didn't mean to keep it a secret but that things had been moving so quickly. I had been afraid that I might have just been a rebound and wanted to give the relationship some time before telling everyone, instead of telling people we're official to then go around a few days later being like ""oh lol, nevermind"". Besides, she definitely was not entitled to know every single personal thing that was going on in my life. I also told her I didn't appreciate her berating me like that, so soon after having been broken up with. I was not in a state of mind to deal with even more emotional stress.

We weren't friends anymore after that. She tried to contact me again after dude and I started seeing each other again, but I figured she just wanted to get all the info to start even more drama.

People seem to take issue when their friends see each other. Did Karen have a point? Should I have told her, despite my insecurities about the relationship? Was she entitled to know two of her friends were dating? Had I really been a horrible friend for that? **Am I the asshole?**

input: I live in a fairly rural town, but our population is growing rapidly. We have one gas station, which used to be sufficient, but now it is always crowded. Particularly around 5pm when most people finish work, you could easily wait 20 minutes to fill up your car. 

Anyway, I waited my turn and started filling up my car. A man approaches me (Im a 23 year old female) holding one of those red gas containers that you might use to fill up a lawnmower. He explains that he’s in a hurry to fill up and get home to his kids, and would I mind filling up his container. The way he phrased it implied he wanted me to fill it up while my credit card was still loaded on the gas pump. I explained that my car takes premium gas, which is very expensive, and politely refused. He got super angry and said something along the lines of “if you can afford a car that takes premium gas, you can afford an extra gallon to fill up my tank.”

Anyway, I refuse again, and then he says, “fine, I’ll just put my card in when you’re done.” However, there’s like 6 cars waiting in line to fill up. I told him he needed to wait, because there were other people in line. He was so mad and told me I was the reason he wouldn’t be able to say goodnight to his kids. 

I felt really bad. What he was asking seemed unfair, but maybe the expectation was that I help him out since we live in a small town? AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: Ok,  so everything started on a weekend with friends, we were planning what  to do on the next day. Two girls who one is my brother's gf and the  other is a dear friend's gf were asking for all of us to go to a motel  to relax and be on the jacuzzi. The rest of us weren't that much into  the idea so we were proposing other stuff and my brother's gf, let's  call her Alexa, began getting angry and demanding to go to the motel or  else she would go with my friend's gf, who we will call Louise... 

My bf,  who we will call Ismael, his friend, Antonio and my brother, Gustavo,  have been friends since they were kids and Antonio said Ismael is the  voice of reason (who he normally is) and that we should listen to him.  and Alexa said: ""He's not mine"" in an angry voice and was secretly  saying things to Louise at the same time they were looking at me (I've  been having problems with Louise about other stuff but we were trying to  work it out) so I began to feel angry and uncomfortable with this  situation since the motel proposition.

So, Ismael said... ""Look, we're  just trying to have a good time, there's no need for this to get out of  hand."" Alexa then said: ""You can shut up because I'm just asking to go  to a motel and no one is backing me up."" This is the moment she crossed  the limit for me and I said: ""You need to back off and chill, we're  organizing something for all of us to enjoy, so tone it down girl"" She  answered: ""Don't mess with me, because I'm talking to Ismael, not you."" I  then stood up and got near her screaming things that I honestly don't  remember because how angry I was. Ismael just took me from the arm and  told me to calm down.

My brother was also asking Alexa to calm down but  she just wasn't listening and this is the same thing for every situation  that doesn't go her way. Anyway, we left (from my parents house lol)  and didn't go out with my brother and Alexa. Since then, things have  been tense between her and me and honestly it makes me furious everytime  I have to spend time with her but she's family... I don't want to be  ""the bigger person"" because she was being a bitch to everyone in that  reunion. Louise and I don't talk anymore, I gave up on that  relationship.

Were we wrong for not listening to her? Should my brother have calmed her down? Should I have not been angry over something (someone) so stupid and retarded?

Sorry  if I made an error, I was translating from Spanish to English all the  discussion, it was a bit more intense than it sounds lol

So... AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: Obligatory long time lurker, I’m on mobile, etc.

There’s a lot of context to this. To start, when I was three months old, my mother passed away from horrible lung cancer. No one knows how she developed it, and she was taken from the world far too soon. I have only a few pictures and don’t know much about her.

A year after her death, my dad remarried. We’ve always referred to it as “our wedding” because it was the start of a new family with the three of us. I was only just over a year old at the time.

Growing up with three branches of family was weird. I’d get confused in elementary school, trying to expand my family trees. Because I had two moms and one dad. We’d visit all three parts of the family and I just assumed it was normal after awhile. Sure, it was hard to explain, but it’s how I grew up. Now that I’m older, I know it’s not normal. I don’t know a single person who calls their step-mom “mom.”

It’s a bit different for me. My parents made the decision when they got married (again, I was only about 1 at the time) that I would grow up with her as “mom” and that was fine. I don’t have many memories from childhood, but I guess they were good at explaining it because I wasn’t confused. I had mom, dad, and Anna, my real mom who I referred to by name.

Now that I’m older, I hate not knowing much about her. I only learned of her birthday two days ago. We never bother celebrating or doing anything. It was never even mentioned to me. Maybe I’m just too emotional about it, but I would have liked growing up celebrating my mother’s birthday. Similar to this, I’m sick of calling her by her name. It’s so impersonal and I want to respect her as my mom.

I’m not religious, but if she’s up there watching me, I want her to know that I think of her as more than an entity that means nothing. She’s my mom, and I think it’s time I can call her that. And just like that, I will say that the decision to call my step-mom “mom” that was made by my parents is no longer sitting well with me.

I’m not sure if this sounds like a validation post so far, but here’s where it gets complicated.

My step-mom has a lot of problems. As someone with diagnosed depression and anxiety, I see some of my own symptoms in her. She has celiac and meineries (?) disease. Without going into what those are, it basically just means she can’t do anything. She stays at home, does laundry, occasionally goes shopping, watches soap operas, and takes her daily nap. To me, it seems like a miserable existence. I don’t know how she does it, living.

She’s very sensitive about all matters regarding the fact that she’s not my real mom. Any jokes or lighthearted comments I make about her “not being my real mom” or “they might think you kidnapped me because I’m not adopted” are always taken horribly. I know that some of those might have been dick moves, but I only mean them as a way to poke fun at our complicated family situation. She doesn’t see it like that.

And now that I’m 17 and old, I want to connect with my real mom more and part of that for me is respecting my true family connections that have been kept from me. And the idea of calling my step-mom “mom” just doesn’t seem right anymore.

WIBTA for telling her this? I don’t have to stop calling her mom, but I know she’ll be heartbroken no matter what I say if I bring it up. Thank you for any responses, no matter what the feedback. It’s been hard a hard topic me lately, and I just want to move forward with the least amount of damage.

Now complete the following example-
input: So my SO of 3 years went to a massage out of town with her mother over the weekend, we live in the U.S just to clarify and she is not a legal adult yet.

&amp;#x200B;

So she told me the next day that she got the massage from a younger guy, though she had booked a female one. Anyways, the massage table had no blankets when she walked in and there was just a table and the towel she could wear.  As she gets in the room the masseur tells her to take of her clothes. So up until this point it seems standard to me.

&amp;#x200B;

The masseur then tells her to take of her bra (redflag for sure) and she complies. Then he proceeded to take of her underwear without consent (another major redflag). She says nothing to the masseur, though she told me she felt very uncomfortable at this point (she assumed this is how massages work as she had never gotten one). 

&amp;#x200B;

She lies flat on her front and the masseur begins to massage her legs. He goes all the way up to her inner thighs that he touched her p\*\*sy,  again she said nothing of it. He then told her to turn on her back and sit up (she had been wearing a towel around her to cover her breasts), and he proceeds to tell her to put her hands up in the air, to which her towel fell to the ground (again she thought this was standard procedure). The masseur began to massage her bare breasts (without asking or anything of the sort). 

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to her the next day to see if she was okay and she just laughed the thing off saying it wasn't a big deal and that she just didn't want to make a scene. I got upset with her because I felt that she should've said something because she was uncomfortable and the whole story didn't sit well with me (being her BF and all).

&amp;#x200B;

AITA for being upset with this whole situation or is this normal for a massage?

&amp;#x200B;

Got mad at under 18 girlfriend who was uncomfortably touched by masseur and she didn't contest.

input: So me and my boyfriend had an argument tonight about this, he thinks I was being the asshole but I don't think I was, although I maybe could have handled things a little better.

We were outside smoking and he started talking to me about the biopic because he'd just watched it today, but I have no interest in it or in Motley Crue in general. So he starts going on and talking about all the things he liked, and I just say ""yeah"" or ""cool"" every now and then so I don't seem totally ignorant. We go inside and I try to go back to watching tv but he carries on talking about it. Eventually he realises I'm not listening and he says ""I'll tell you about it when the programme gas finished"" and I half-joke ""you don't have to tell me about it at all""

So he gets upset, her tells me that he doesn't want to watch a film together as we'd planned anymore, and that I've hurt his feelings. So I go upstairs and about an hour later he comes up and we argue because he felt like I was calling him boring and I just wasn't interested in hearing about the film.

So, AITA? Should I have handled things better or dogs he overreact?

input: My son was 23 when this happened but I've always felt guilty about it. This was a few years ago. 

My son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say ""Oh mom"" and go to his room and shut the door.

Ever since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.

He learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.

Finally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.

He kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.

Then it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. 

I threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.

At the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.

A few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).

He agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. 

Was there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA

input: TL;DR A friend of mine moving overseas fell in love with me, I made it seem like I was also into it, started dating someone else, and slowly stopped talking to my friend.

Long wall of text incoming

Last year, I (27M) moved to a large metropolitan area, knowing virtually no one there. I got a job working on a team of eight, including a girl that I'll call Laura. Laura is cute, not really my type, but we have a lot in common including an affinity for our hometown sports team. We spend a lot of time together going to happy hours with coworkers, playing board games, generally being friends- certainly nothing romantic. 

Fast forward five months and we start chatting a bit more often, frequently about more and more intimate things. Because we work together, we still deny any feelings starting to develop. The next month, she finds out she's moving overseas. She quits her job, but before she quits, I do some pretty sizable farewell gestures, including planning a going away party. At this point, it's clear we definitely have feelings for one another and, because she's no longer part of our org, we start making out and eventually hook up a couple times. Because she's going overseas for a few years, we have a long discussion that I shouldn't wait for her and that if we start to date other people, it's ok.

Laura moves overseas to a place where she knows absolutely no one. She helps me apply for her job, which I get. We text NONSTOP. We send each other dirty pics, talk often on the phone, tell each other we love one another. She meets a few local people but still doesn't have all that many people. Meanwhile I'm continuing to make friends in the city I live in, meet new people, generally continue on with my life.

In August, about five months from when she left, I met this girl (Nicole) that I fell absolutely head over heels for. Because I was interested in cultivating this new relationship, I started to spend more time with Nicole and less time talking to Laura. I don't want to upset Laura with the development of a new relationship, so I don't tell her about Nicole, especially if it doesn't work out. Laura seems to notice something's off, and asks me about it- I tell her everything is fine. We continue to chat, though at a lighter rate; I read her texts and don't respond right away like I used to. In my mind, it now feels like I'm in two relationships.

I decide to tell Laura that I'm seeing Nicole to help explain why I'm being so distant. I text her (probably the bad move) and tell her that I'm seeing someone and want to talk to her about it. She says ok, we can talk on the phone after I'm out of work. After I get out of work, I give Laura a call. Laura is furious at me, saying I destroyed her trust, ruined our friendship, that I'm a pussy for not telling her about Nicole sooner. She says she no longer wants to talk to me until I think about the situation and apologize. I say ok and hang up.

In about a week, I send Laura a long email apologizing for hiding my relationship from her and being so distant. We talk for a while and she agrees to start talking to me again under one condition: If I start getting distant again, she's going to stop talking to me for good. I say ok and hang up.

Fast forward a few weeks and we're still chatting a bit but this time I notice her getting a bit more distant. Short answers, curt responses, no longer continuing conversations. I figure she no longer wants to talk and stop talking. She doesn't resume conversation. That was the last time I talked to her- she's now blocked me on all social media, blocked my number, and told other friends of ours about the situation, essentially turning those friends against me. 

On one hand, I understand why she's mad at me- I basically continued a relationship with her after she moved and didn't address the issue when something else came up. On the other hand, she chose to move away, understood I wouldn't wait to be in a relationship with her longterm, and didn't bring it up further when it seemed like I was pulling away. So the real question is- am I an asshole or is this just an unfortunate circumstance in which I lose a good friend of mine? Any advice would be great here.

input:   

Am I the Asshole? 

My wife and had a baby a year ago. We are getting ready to have a one year birthday party. My wife has been working really hard getting ready for the birthday party. Her mom, sister, and a few friends are coming from out of town to attend. My wife is extremely type A and has been killing herself making the house look good (which we recently moved into). However this has been super stressful for me, I’m travelling for work and nothing is where I left it, we have new bathmats, new shower curtains, new coffee tables, new futon, new rugs, so much stuff. A lot of this requires assembly. There's also packages of party decorations, and streamers, and masks, and blah blah blah. This is stressing me the fuck out from a cost stand point and just the fact that there’s five packages at the door everyday. I don’t know why I find it so overwhelming exactly, but I do. There’s overflowing garbage from all of the boxes that we had to have hauled away. We have enough money, it just feels wasteful and excessive to me.

I about lost my shit last night because someone had to come haul away all the boxes and drive through our yard leaving a six inch deep gouge that’s twenty feet long. The freezer’s leaking water all over the tile floor because it’s too full, my wife tried to put up curtains and left a bunch of error holes in the drywall, and my wife and MIL are cooking an involved dinner that we won’t eat until 9:30 when I’ve just had a fourteen hour day of work and out of state travel. She knows I’m stressed about it and she’s mad at me because the home is something she was proud of is now ruined and I’ve “broken her heart”. I’ve told her I like everything and that it looks good (because it does) but she knows I’m irritated. In fairness I was visibly distraught by the lawn, packages, freezer, and drywall immediately when I got home and pointed all these items out. In front of her mom. But I wasn’t being angry or yelling, I just wanted to know what the fuck was going on.

The cherry on top is my mother-in-law. My wife told me was coming in last Sunday on last Friday. My MIL and wife drink heavily and stay up late having heated discussions about their family. She is going to stay for a week. Last night my wife came to bed late at 1 AM and woke me up to cry at me and tell me she didn’t understand why I was so mad at her. Honestly I’m mad at her mom who casually cusses me out all the time. It’s under the guise of a joke but eventually it becomes very disrespectful. She said Fuck You to me like three times yesterday and called me a bastard and a bitch the night before. That COULD be funny but in this instance I’m just not into it and don’t want to be spoken to like that in my own home. My wife says I was acting pissed off all night. Well, in fairness, I was. Am I an asshole? My wife has been working from home, doing all this, doing a great job with our daughter, and doing the lion’s share of the housework. I’m not upset with her, I’m just frustrated that this situation seems so overwhelming and out of control.

Now complete the following example-
input: I’m honestly at a loss here, so I’m turning to the most neutral of neutral parties— strangers on the internet.  And sorry, this is long (and if the formatting is fucked up— mobile user). But I just want to provide as much information as I can to get an honest appraisal of whether I’m the asshole here. 

So. I’m a 33 year old woman who is currently in the aftermath of what feels like the most “am I taking fucking crazy pills??!” ever argument with two female friends: one I’ve been friends with for 18 years (32– I’ll call her N) and one I’ve been friends with for 11 (also 33– I’ll call her F). 

I introduced the two of them about two years ago, and gradually I noticed that I was feeling a lot more... judgment, let’s say, coming from the two of them together than I ever did from either of them individually.  Which I tried to just accept and ignore, figuring it was a combination of two strong personalities who both like to be right up against me, who just sort of goes with the flow and doesn’t like to argue or try to justify myself. (Note. I probably should have addressed this all at this point, but... I hate conflict.)

So around a year ago, I had an argument with N about a guy I was hooking up with, which led to her basically telling me that she didn’t want to hear about who I had sex with or who I was seeing because she didn’t like the choices I was making. Which was totally within her right to say, even if it sucked to not be able to talk about that part of my life with her.  (Again, should have addressed this here, probably.)

Fast forward to nowish, when I had an FWB relationship with a bartender from my regular bar.   Again, didn’t tell her about it because of the previous fight and because every time I tried to bring up any guy related things with her after that, she would act very dismissively, telling me that these guys are “garbage human beings” and I’m “not living up to (my) potential” and “can’t do this because (I’m) just going to get hurt.”  Fine. I’m an adult and I understand my actions have consequences, so yup. We good, won’t bring it up anymore since it clearly doesn’t sit well with you. Sucks, but ok.

Well, as things tend to do, it got back to her (even though she doesn’t live in the area), and she and F confronted me about it on NYE.  I apologized for not mentioning my mattress-related activities, but again stressed that I thought N didn’t want to know about it.  It seemed to pass without much incident, though I suppose that could have been due to the lubrication of booze. But I assumed everything was fine.  

However, every time I then mentioned him, she returned to the old pattern of “oh. I don’t care about him.”  So again. Stopped talking about it, particularly once he started seeing someone and the mattress-related activities naturally ceased.  But I continued to be friends with him because, despite the fact that we have completely different views on almost everything, we get along very well, he is always willing to have respectful conversations, to listen to me, and often intellectually challenges me in ways that most of my other friends don’t.  I’m NOT saying that he’s a great person or a saint or anything, but he treats me just fine and that’s generally how I judge people. 

FINALLY coming to the present (about a week ago).  F and N and I are texting about the dating trials of a third friend. I make an offhand joking comment about how I’m so sick of hearing about other people’s relationship problems lately. Which I fully admit probably wasn’t the best idea. Because it led to N asking who I was talking about, me admitting it was my bartender friend and his new lady love, and her responding alternately “oh I don’t care” and “I literally could not care any less.”  Again. Message received, and I changed the subject. 

But N kept bringing it back to this guy and why am I friends with him because she thinks he’s disrespectful and a terrible person and should I really be listening to the relationship problems of a person I used to have sex with, and even going so far as to inquire whether all of our interactions were still appropriate given that he is seeing someone.  All followed by, “sorry if this seems harsh but I just care about you and think you’re making poor choices, and honestly, you’ve been super shady about this whole thing from the beginning.” Which. Ok. That’s maybe a valid perspective?

And I expressed my appreciation for that perspective, honestly, but also expressed that I was fine with the choices I was making and, after at least three rounds of this during this particular conversation, was feeling a little patronized, especially since she had consistently said that she didn’t care to hear about that part of my life, and that while I appreciated that she didn’t like this guy, he is my friend and that’s my choice to make.  (Also, although I didn’t bring it up, N has been seeing someone since December and didn’t share it with me until about three weeks ago, so the fact that she called ME shady didn’t sit well with me for that reason as well.)

Cue the biggest... Event? Shitshow? Whatever. It basically ended with N saying that she was washing her hands of me, since I didn’t think she cared about her friends and how could I when she spent the last year worrying about my feelings and my job and my actions and how I was sleeping and my health and etc etc. 

I tried to clarify that that absolutely wasn’t what I meant, just that she seemed to have expressed that she didn’t want to hear about the men in my life unless they were a relationship prospect or someone she approved of, but she just kept saying that if I thought she didn’t care about me, then fine, she just wouldn’t.  F mostly stopped chiming in around this time (earlier in this shitshow, some discussion was had about a situation in which I was most definitely the asshole to F, which I apologized for and tried to make right.)

It ended with me saying that again, I was sorry that I had made her feel that way, that wasn’t what I intended or thought at all, and that I appreciated all the years of friendship we have shared. 

I haven’t heard from either N or F since, though they’ve both done some “subtweeting” on various forms of social media that I’ve just ignored. 

I... honestly have no idea what happened here, and if I’m the asshole or not.   On one hand I feel bad for what happened, but on the other hand I don’t really feel like I did anything wrong other than not hashing this out earlier.  I just hate that this is happening, and also that it’s over a guy who admittedly isn’t the best person in the world (although lately he has been a much more supportive friend to me than N and F have.)  

This definitely isn’t the hill I would have chosen to die on, but... here I am, I guess. I’d really appreciate some perspective and judgment from you guys.

Now complete the following example-
input: After weeks, I went back to school today. I was confident and truly wanted to be brave and act as if everything is ok. I still have some scars on my face and neck (my parents beat me with a wire). 

&amp;#x200B;

when I entered class, every one began to ask me about my scars, I told them that I my father accidently hit the door on my face while i was behind the door. they were suspicious but i didn't care much/

&amp;#x200B;

I lied to the teachers too, i told them that my father accidently hit the door on my face while i was behind the door. they believed me. 

&amp;#x200B;

what really hurts is that today i tried my best to concentrate but couldn't. when people are talking to me i feel like i cant understand them, we had a test and i couldn't solve any question. i was always good at tests/exams, i am top at my class but today i felt insanely not normal. 

&amp;#x200B;

everyone were staring at me, it was hard.

&amp;#x200B;

then, i saw my ex with a girl. she was sitting on his lap. when i saw them, i started crying and run out. he run after me, he saw my face with some scars. he immediately understood that my parents did it (he is my best friend for 10 years). 

&amp;#x200B;

he started asking me what happened, he was worried but i was just embarrassed because kids where watching us. we went far from school, i tried my best to not cry but tears kept on rolling and i told him ''its your fault that i am crying'' ''you left me after all this years'' 

&amp;#x200B;

he said that he didn't leave me, he hugged me. he wanted to talk more about it but i couldn't. we went to my brothers house where i live now. that's when i told him everything that have happened. my brother wasn't home yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

i asked him if he doesn't really want us to be together again, he couldn't answer so i asked about his relationship with that girl, he said that she was just a girl he knows and that there is nothing between them. then he said that he loves me and a lot. he said that he loves me as a woman and not only as a friend. he said that he wants a real relationship, a serious one. he also asked me about my feelings. i said that i love him too (idk if i do love him or not, i lied). he was really happy, he was smiling and said that we should start from 0 and should forget all the bad things. that he will be with me through all my hardships. 

&amp;#x200B;

then we just cuddled and he told me to just talk about everything that bothers me and so i did talk for 2 hours (i think) then i fell asleep, i sleep most of the time when i cry a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

when i woke up, my brother and my bf were talking, my bf told my brother everything that happened today. we ordered delicious food, well my brother believes that if he give me delicious food or buys me best clothes/shoes that i will be happy. my bf ate with us and then left. 

&amp;#x200B;

i feel exhausted, i really feel so uncomfortable and confused. i just want to vanish. but anyways, AITA/ was I an \*\*\*hole?

Now complete the following example-
input: For starts I don’t want this person to be dead and I am sad this person (x) is dead at a young age. 
X and I had a bad relationship. I trained x in work and x was lazy and at times abuisve about being lazy. X wasn’t from here and used that to their advantage plenty of times. I say that because x put down their abusive behaviour as being a hot type personality that only Xs people are. X also disappeared over certain holiday periods for weeks at a time to be home with their family but always have some excuse. Other people (me) had to cover their shifts. X got a warning and that was all. 
X was very very good at cosying up to higher ups in work and anyone who didn’t get along with them x claimed were racists. 
The sad part. X died of a brain tumour last week. My social media has been inundated with comments what an amazing person they were even from folk who frequently bitched about them. 
I am hearing loads about it at work and I can’t help but in a complete rage about it. 
They died young it was sad I would never want that for anyone but they were still to me a complete asshole. And yet I can’t help but hate myself for being angry at someone who had the utter misfortune of dying so young. 
Am I the asshole here? 
P.s I have said nothing to anyone about how I feel I just act sad ( I am just not to their degree) and then let them talk about it till eventually conversations change. 
Also x only found out about the tumour 2 months ago and died due to a haemorrhage caused by it.

Now complete the following example-
input: So this happened back in May. 

Let me preface this by saying that my brother in law is 16, I'm 20, and I'm married to his sister who's 21 (20 at the time). They are 4 years apart and grew up really close, as they live up in the mountains, about 30 minutes away from any other civilization. Since we met and started dating (3-4  years ago) He's always been physically rough with her, trying to wrestle, grabbing her as if she were a brother. I usually tell him to stop, half joking, buy always gives the excuse ""she's my sister! It's ok!"". Not saying you can't be rough with your sister (I definitely was as a kid), but once you're an adult, that type of horse-play usually stops.

Because he never had a brother, he has taken me as an older brother. He copies me, and loves everything I do, basically becoming obsessed with me. I love it!!! I didn't really get along with my brother growing up (6years older than me) and so it is really great to have a younger brother now.

So in May, we had been married for two months, since March. We were visiting at their home (8hr drive) after this last semester ended, we visit maybe twice a year as it's far. The visit went well, and during breakfast one morning, her brother came down stairs and as she (my wife) was sitting on a stool next to me, he puts her in a headlock. Now she instantaneously looked at me and asked for help, and told him to stop. He didn't stop for about 15 seconds, so I stepped in behind him and put him in a headlock. 

I'm in the Army, and not much bigger than him, but I am substantially stronger. He submitted and during the headlock I squoze (past tense of squeeze? Haha) hard enough for him to be choked, and I let up  (still had him in a headlock, just like he had my wife) and I whispered to him ""I don't care if she's your sister. you will never put my wife in a headlock again"". 

He kind of slinked down for a few hours and didn't talk to anyone. He came around and stopped feeling sorry for himself, but he was very visibly upset. 

Now, we still have a snap streak going, (his idea) and all is back to normal. Thinking about it, I was just protecting my wife. I myself went through a similar situation with my older brother in law who married my sister, and I believe that to be a very important lesson to learn.

Am I an asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: Before anyone calls this bullshit, I wanna say that I am actually confused about this whole situation and I really need an opinion from outside of the story. Emotions are still flowing, so if I let anything out I'll edit the post.

So, for context, I used to have my own PC, but it stopped working recently, and it's on repair. So I either don't use a PC at all or use my dad's notebook, which usually is not an option because my 5yo sister (I'll call her ""Sam"") is using it ALL THE TIME. Whenever I ask it from her to use for a while she either yells ""NO"" or cries for my parents' attention, and they never did anything about it. Eventually I gave up and stopped asking.

Ok, so today my mom went out with her, and I had the notebook for myself the whole afternoon. My mom gets back, we talk about college for a while, and then I let Sam use the notebook for a few hours. 

When Sam went to her bed, I was about to get back to the notebook again when my mom asks for it so my sister could use, cause she didn't want to sleep. I got mad and asked my mom why, cause they always let her use it and I never get the chance to do anything. She basically got mad too and started calling me names and answered my question by saying ""because I want to"".

Things escalated quickly and she started pushing me against the wall while still calling me names (I can't say I stayed calm either, I was trying to defend myself/minimize the pain by pushing back a little bit, I had no intentions in hurting her and I'm pretty sure I didn't).

When she released me I kinda felt bad and decided to give her the notebook and guess what? My mom didn't accept it anymore, got really pissed and tried to tell my father what happened. She said that ""I no longer existed to her"", and tried to justify that with her version of the truth (that I was the one trying to hurt her, that I ""grabbed her arm"", while completely ignoring what she did to me.) I called her out and added the details she ""forgot"" and my dad actually stayed on my side for once and said we would talk about that tomorrow.

So, basically, AITA for not wanting to give Sam the computer or should I give it to her even though she already uses it all the time? Honestly I think my parents are going too soft on Sam and have been going for a while (this time just my mom, dad actually stayed on my side for once), but whenever I say something they ignore me, since ""they are the parents, they decide what's best for their children"".

Now complete the following example-
input: Right now, I'm seeing a woman in a fairly casual situation. I'm 27 years old and she's 25, and the incident I'll talk about happened on our third date.

On Saturday night we went to a gourmet burgers and fries place (think Pulp Fiction John Travolta/Uma Thurman car in the wall joint) for my birthday dinner. It was her choice and I thought it sounded like a grand idea, as corny restaurants are always a blast. A while after our burgers came the waitress paid us the typical ""how is everything"" visit, and stuck around for a short chat after. During the course of our talk I ended up mentioning that it was my birthday, and she told me that it was hers too. It was a nice little coincidence and we all seemed to get a kick out of it.

Eventually our waitress excused herself. After we finished eating we ordered a couple of shakes, at which point the waitress and I nicknamed each other ""birthday girl"" and ""birthday boy,"" respectively.

Our check came, and to my surprise my date didn't make any indication that she was going to pay. I didn't raise a stink about it of course, and I didn't think it was exactly a huge deal. I thought it was normally for the non-birthday party to pay on someone else's birthday, but again, different people may be used to different things.

I checked the bill and saw ""Happy Birthday!"" written at the bottom with a cute smiley face. I put in the cost of the meal with a standard tip, and we got up and put on our coats. At the last second I told my date to hold on a bit, opened the bill back up, and slipped in another $100. I wrote with the provided pen ""You too!"" next to her message. My date noticed this and gave me a sideways look.

In the car I asked what she wanted to do next, and she gave me the silent treatment, just kind of sighing and looking out the window. I figured it had something to do with the tip I gave the waitress because that's when she started acting like that. I asked what was wrong and she just responded by settling deeper into the seat. The next few minutes were completely silent and I just started heading towards her house.

She abruptly blurted out a bit later that I was wasting my money and she couldn't believe I was so irresponsible. I asked her what was wrong with giving $100 to our waitress for her great service, and she said that I should have spent the money elsewhere, or at least given it to a deserving charity. Again, I reiterated that I felt it wasn't a big deal, and couldn't get a decent answer out of her.

I took her home and without a word she just stepped out of my car, walked to her front door, opened the door, and walked without even turning her head back. Last night she texted me saying that I overtipped the waitress and asked how I felt about giving the waitress $100 when I haven't given her (my date) a single gift yet. I haven't responded and it is kind of keeping me up.

input: Normal mobile formatting apology

So here is the thing, he is right. I am the favorite. But I earned it. I got all the grades, I'm going to college while also having a good job. I've done everything (most things) right.

He on the other hand has been an ass. He bullied me when we were kids. He was at constant odds with my parents especially my dad. I spent most my life hating him but he has chilled out a lot, with me at least, so I'd say we are more friends now. But he's still awful to my parents.

Yesterday he walked in crying about how he wants to be a Firefighter but mom and dad dont believe in him (after he put a hole in the wall because he was mad). To do this he has to quit his job with my dad's friend after promising he wouldn't, so my dad is unhappy about that. 

I told him explain himself to them, why he wants to do it, his plan to go about it, they aren't unreasonable and will help him do whatever he wants. That's when he said he wants to be a Firefighter because they are cool.

I was done, I laid into how that is beyond a dumb reason to chase a career, how he's done no research at all and no wonder they are pissed. I told him he's a dick to them and needs to act like an adult and prove they should believe in him cause he's done a piss poor job of doing it so far. He just kind of walked away.

I love my brother, my parents love my brother but god he's hard to deal with sometimes. Am I the asshole? I was trying to help him but maybe I could have gone about it in a more nice way... lifes been hard on my whole family lately and we are all pretty on edge. Let me know what you think.

I get the part where it's generally wrong. I feel like in the situation it was kinda okay though. Basically, he has bipolar disorder and he's always moping around about everything and just in general he's always thinking irrationally. We were just talking about this thing on the news about a kid who committed suicide. That's where it kinda took a turn and he said that he can relate to them. I was already irritated because he changed the topic to something depressing like usual. He also just destroyed the mood. I regret saying it but we started having an argument about it and I was just trying to explain to him that he needs to stop talking about his mental health when he denies to take medication. It ended with me saying that if he's so depressed and if he hates his life so much, to kill himself. I caught on immediately and apologized but he was already hurt by it. He didn't reply to my apologies, he just left. I feel like an asshole but at the same time it's kinda true.

input: so the other day i was waiting for a bus and someone who clearly had some sort of disability started waiting with me. when he first arrived he asked if he had missed the bus, and i had told him no and then he just kept chatting my ear off. the bus ended up being an hour late (!!!!!) and it was cold so i caught myself getting annoyed (not with him at all) but i didn’t want him to take it the wrong way so i happily engaged in conversation with him while we waited (we spoke about his plant collection, build-a-bear and his birthday plans)

the bus finally arrived and it was ridiculously crowded, by far one of the busiest busses i have ever been on. he kept trying to chat with me on the bus but we both had to stand and with the volume of people we were slowly getting separated. a few stops down me and about 6 other passengers (he was not one of them) had to get off the bus to make room for a stroller getting off. behind the very crowded bus was the same bus with no one on it, so instead of getting back on the crowded bus i grabbed a transfer and got on the other bus. 

now this is where i am conflicted on whether i ata or not. i didn’t say goodbye, or say anything. i can guarantee if this was someone with no kind of disability i wouldn’t have thought twice about (i am not great with speaking to strangers) - and i almost wonder if that in itself makes me an asshole? all i keep thinking about is if that were my son i would just want people to be kind and considerate with him.

I'm a digital and traditional artist and in one of my classes we create t shirts and things (socks, lanyards, water bottles, stickers, you name it).

Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

input: Today (2/17) is my birthday and I’m turning 24 but lately life hasn’t quite been going my way. I’ve been struggling with anxiety, depression and addiction and recently started back on medicinal and behavioral therapy. My parents (mom more than dad) have been really supportive through everything but at the same time my mother is incredibly controlling and anxious in her own right and is somewhat of a trigger. Last night I got home from work at midnight and didn’t really fall asleep until 3 and woke up at 6:30 and woke up kinda depressed but I got up and showered anyway before mom took me to church (she makes me go.) We had plans today after I got off work to go to dinner but I realized last night as I lied awake that I don’t want to celebrate my birthday this year, in light of recent events it just doesn’t feel right. That is,  I don’t want to go to dinner, so I texted to cancel dinner plans and decided I’d rather stay on campus after I got off to study some with a classmate but I agreed to be home in time for cake. My question is am I the asshole for not wanting to celebrate and go to dinner with them?

input: Obligatory backstory: I absolutely love this girl. I can easily see myself marrying hey some day. For almost a year we've been doing long distance and talked everyday about how I wish I was there with her. Fast forward I'm making it happen. Sold car, informed work, leaving family, driving 500+ miles to move my life so that I can be with her (and also for my own reasons as well). But this is the biggest, scariest thing I've ever done. 

Well, in a few days I will be there. She accidentally made plans with her family to visit during the same weekend of me moving in. I'm hurt because even though I will see her so much after move-in day, I figured this was a climatic moment for us. We've dreamed of this. I just want her to be beside me as I am so proud and happy. For the memories.

Idk, I feel somewhat emotional. Please set me straight if I'm being unreasonable. Thanks.

input: A little backstory for context, my best friend and i have been close for about four years, and things started turning sour around this time last year. 

So for a while I was living with my best friend (bf for short) and her family, and I didn't have anywhere else to go. All was well until she started seeing this guy, and it really got bad. 

The first time was when I bought train tickets for bf and I to go visit a friend. We were only there for about an hour before she had her boyfriend come pick her up, leaving me stuck there by myself until the train came a few days later (I had no option to leave with her, his car only had two seats). 

So I ended up staying up north for a while, and while I was gone her boyfriend stayed over for a while. Once I came back, he just never left (keep in mind we were sharing a bed so this entire time she made me sleep on the couch). 

A few fights later and a months worth of sleepless nights on the couch, I decided to move. After a while I ended up forgiving her, and all was well. Recently she was going to come visit me for a week but ended up canceling on me because her boyfriend was coming to town, and I just decided that I was done dealing with her doing that kind of stuff to me. AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: adopted a 6 year old dog about 7 months ago.  He’s 60 lb hound mix. He was brought to shelter from another state when his owner got sick.  In previous home, they knew owner was home a lot, had several dogs and found our dog as a stray a few years prior. 

He was timid but loving.  He is loyal, friendly dog 99% of the time.  He’s great with kids, loves walks, cuddle, etc.  but he won’t be crated and has severe anxiety.

7 months ago we put out crate, feed him in it, which he would do (and still does) but when we tried to crate train he resisted, pulls, jumps up on us to not go in.  So we stopped.  He would chew shoes, soft pillows and even chewed three doorknobs.  We left him toys, etc...didn’t stop.  We Took anything he could chew out of living room.

Over summer I was home and we tried to crate train again...same behavior.   I think me being home made it worse.  He wasn’t alone very often and if he was, he destroyed anything he could get.  In early September just after I was back at work, he destroyed our couch, flipping pieces over, cut himself, etc.

In response, we made him a pen that we could walk in with him, tried to train him in it, he figured out how to get out and cut himself and hurt his face.  Further destroying our couch and anything else he could find including plastic, metal, etc.  he even opened a closet to get my coat out and eat it.  

So we got a training collar and a steel pen.  Got him in 3 times before he got out.  Had to reinforce it. I usually am the one to put him in before I leave with kids and I can’t get him in. The dog fights me for as long as I have, jumps on me, and I’m not strong enough to physically pull him in.  It becomes a battle.  I’ve been bringing him to husband at work but it’s not working out.  Dog is chewing things if husband and co-workers leave area.  It’s a garage that has chemicals, etc.  he can’t always be with our dog.

We consulted vet, put him on anxiety meds, but based on cost we can’t keep him on them forever...we also can’t afford the behaviorist/training that they recommend.  We’ve maxed out our savings with crates, meds, etc.  we also can’t afford to replace our couch so we have it taped up with a blanket over it.  It was 8 pcs. We have 4 ripped up pieces left.  

His anxiety is so severe that if he sees me getting dressed for work he cries, follows me around, and will hide if I call him to try to get him in crate.  He can’t handle being alone.  

Our kids love him but they aren’t the ones fighting him and/or worried he will harm himself if alone.  We can’t go anywhere unless the dog comes because the crate training isn’t working.  

WIBTA if we call shelter and surrender him?  Love the dog but worry he needs a different type of situation...

Now complete the following example-
input: I just wanted to know a more objective opinion, because I fell like everyone who knows any party in this situation is going to be biased. The story isn’t exactly very interesting or life changing, but I have been feeling wronged and like an ass simultaneously, and don’t know what to do. Should I apologize?

So basically, it all started as a normal conversation at the dinner table, there haven’t been any arguments recently or anything, and everyone seemed to be in a good mood. My parents were asking about my plans for the summer, so I said that I was going to try to get an internship at a psychiatric hospital for the two moths I will have off from uni (it is something that many med students do where I am from, not necessarily a psychiatric hospital, but in a hospital in general, because that helps with getting a job later), and didn’t want to add any other plans in advance in case I get it, so that there wouldn’t be any complications later.
My mother instantly seemed to be annoyed by what I said, and simply replied with:

M: “If you want to work in a psychiatric hospital you should get of your medication first”

I felt that this was really out of nowhere, because my medication is not exactly for a behavioural problem, or for a mood disorder, or anything. And even if it was, what does it have to do with anything? When dad saw where the mood was shifting, he instantly excused himself out of there (honestly, I wish I had done the same thing), and so there I was, left alone with my mum. I told her, that the medication I was on was prescribed by a professional, and that it really improves my general wellbeing (it is a SNRI, because I have insomnia, and it really helps me sleep).
She says, that I am too young to be on that kind of medication and therefore am not mentally stable enough for that kind of job. I got a bit irritated, not going to lie. She constantly tells me that I shouldn’t act like a know it all because I don’t have a degree yet, but sometimes the things she says are really ridiculous and she still won’t just accept that sometimes she’s wrong.

So, this is the part that I regret. I was tired of listening to that, so I interrupted her and said, that if she has no medical training at all, let alone a degree in any medical field, she shouldn’t think that she knows better than professionals and that she shouldn’t just throw her uninformed opinion around. She got angry about this, and said that she was just looking out for me, and that I supposedly never listen to her. I got up and tried left the room, because I didn’t see the conversation being beneficial in any way, because we were just both getting mad, and haven’t really addressed this to her since.

I feel like I was wrong by telling her not to say what she thinks, because that’s just her opinion, and when I think back, she should be allowed to express it. But I also feel like it was wrong of her to call me out on a thing I have no control over.

AITA for not wanting to hear her out, because I thought, that her opinion was uninformed?

input: My group of friends, all mid twenties, have planned a big bar crawl across town for St. Patrick’s day this year. We’re generally responsible, tax-paying adults and all that, but every year for St. Patrick’s day we revert to total degenerates. It’s a wild time. 

One of my friends just discovered that she’s pregnant and we’re all pretty thrilled, but some people in the group don’t know yet because it’s so early. I didn’t invite her to the crawl. For one, I didn’t want her to be backed into a corner if people who don’t know she’s pregnant ask why she isn’t drinking and for two, she’s pregnant and it’s a rowdy bar crawl. I just assumed she would have no interest. 

She found out, however, and was pretty upset. She said that she felt left out because of her pregnancy. I never meant to cut her out and we still invite her to everything else we do, even going out to bars at night, but she rarely comes to that anymore so I assumed she just didn’t want to be around alcohol. She told me I was incredibly rude to invite everyone but her, but I assumed that a pregnant woman wouldn’t want to deal with a city full of drunk people and bar crawls.

input: Here's a little backstory: I am currently visiting my home country Uzbekistan from the US, Having the opportunity to even go to the US from my country is considered a big deal here.,. I haven't seen my little cousin in around 4-5years. He is 14 years old and once he found out I had an instagram he immediately made one.  If im completely honest with you, He is SUPER annoying and is constantly making dirty jokes which aren't even funny. He has this annoying habit of bringing up the fact that I came from the US and sarcastically saying that im cooler and richer than he is for that fact. (I'm not even rich!)  Ever since I came from the US he would constantly make jokes about how rich I am (which im not), and jokingly ask for 50$, this pisses me off (because he literally makes these jokes everyday), and when he notices that he says something like ""Alright sorry, you're cool you're from America, and we're not."" This further pisses me off.  Now to the instagram part, when he made one he obviously requested to follow me, I thought about it for a minute but eventually just accepted it and followed him back.  Next day when I see his profile I noticed he followed all my followers, I was kind of annoyed ( BUT THIS WASNT THE TIPPING POINT.) I was already having thoughts about blocking him but what made me super pissed was that he constantly kept showing me pictures of some of my girl friends and would say some annoying dumb shit like ""Is this your girlfriend??"" I'd say ""No"" to which he'd reply to "" Don't lie."" (he did this with multiple girls throughout the day) That was the last straw, so later on I blocked him, and when he found out he got kind of upset and hasnt talked to me in a while, I feel like what I did was kind of harsh but I honestly dont want to unblock him, AITA?

Immediately after I was shocked that I said that and said sorry because I don’t wanna talk to her (or anyone for that matter) in such a rude way. 
She freaked out and started crying because her father used to suddenly change in personality like that and abuse her. I calmed her down and apologized.
What I’d like to know though is if I should re-evaluate how I treat my girlfriend and what I think of her (i.e. make a conscious effort to be more understanding and respectful) or if my little outburst was normal?

input: My best friend of 15 years, and the best man at my wedding, ""Donny"" \[32m\] is super fun to hang out with, and is usually up for anything.  We've gone on countless adventures together - sailing, backpacking, camping, ATVing, lan parties (showing our age!), motorcycle trips, canoe camping, etc. 

The problem is, he's never really gotten his shit together.  He hasn't held a job for longer than a year, and has lived no less than 20 places in his life.  After his girlfriend of 9 years cheated on him, got pregnant during the fling, guilted him into being the father while debating an abortion, then had a miscarriage... he decided to finally seek professional help, and end that relationship.  He's been diagnosed with depression/ADD/alcoholism/anxiety and is taking prescribed medication to work through those issues.

To make matters worse, for the past few years he's been living with his narcissistic mom. But it's okay because she's a  changed woman, and now dishes out cutting remarks with a smile and a soft voice.  Donny thinks she can be annoying, but not ""all that bad.""

I strongly disagreed, and after working though my own issues with narcissists, I wanted to help him get out of that environment and start a life of his own.  He had been making such good progress seeking help and going on medication I thought she was the last thing holding him back.  

He's never actually lived on his own.  He's always lived/been supported by other people, including his mom and me in the past.  After I lived alone in a private seasonal campground for a month to get my own head on straight about some issues I was dealing with, I thought how great of an opportunity it would be for him to live there full time.  He could buy a camper for 5-7k, and pay $1500 in rent each year for the plot.  Cost of living would be extremely low ($125 rent/month - plus food, electricity and propane).  It's filled with friendly blue-collar workers who leave their campers there year round and treat it like a vacation cabin.  They are all having a blast, drinking, socializing, telling tall tails, driving around in golf carts, etc.  It's just a fun place to be, and an upgrade from his only other realistic option - a trailer park.  The mood at a trailer park is different I'd think... most people live there out of necessity not desire, and that probably wouldn't help him with his mental health.

He thought the camper/campground was a great idea so I helped him pick out an old 26 foot camper, inspect it (surprisingly good shape), talk the seller down ($1200 to $800) and borrow a friends truck to tow it home.  He paid for it of course.  I told him he could live in it at my house as long as he paid his own electricity and didn't barge in to our house without first calling/texting.  The plan was for him to live in it, fix it up, then sell it and upgrade to a better 5-7k camper and ultimately move into a seasonal campground.  (They have restrictions on age/condition of the campers they let in.)  We set an August 1st 2019 move out deadline (about a year).

During this time my wife and I were planning our honeymoon - sailing around the Virgin Islands.  Then Hurricane Irma hit, destroying everything on the islands.  We decided on Costa Rica for our honeymoon instead.  The charter company in the Virgin Islands could only give credit rather than a refund, so we planned to go the following year.  (Quick note, we are not rich and these two trips were very expensive for us.  We had only budgeted for one.)  I suggested that we turn it into a trip with friends since plane tickets were only $400 round trip.  Since we had already paid for the boat, it wouldn't cost any more to bring a few people along.  So we invited Donny and my wife's friend ""Sarah"".  Both single, but they didn't hit it off.  They only had to buy plane tickets, and pay their own expenses like food, taxis and souvenirs - we would cover the \~4k boat rental.

They were invited in April, and we planned to fly there in December - 8 months later.  I kept everyone updated by email with itineraries and estimated personal costs as I planned out the trip.

At some point during all of this, Donny has moved into his camper at my house, begins reverting to old ways, stops showing up for his full time job, and gets fired.  He picks up a part time job where he has the option to work 40 hours a week, but can work as much or as little as he wants.  He of course picks the latter.  I'm beginning to suspect that he won't have enough money for the trip so I ask him about it.  He assures me he will have enough and all is good.  He already bought the plane tickets.

So we fly out of cold ass Wisconsin and into the tropics.  Everyone is in high spirits, I mean, how can you not be?  We get to our rental sailboat, a 2017 Jeanneau 349, and it's a fucking dream boat.  We set sail and go from island to island, sleeping in the boat.  It's amazing.  Dolphins, white sandy beaches, perfect weather, beach-side restaurants, 85 degree water, snorkeling, you name it.  Then it happens.  **The ambush.**

&amp;#x200B;

Donny - waiting until my wife and Sarah are off the boat - ""I'm out of money, I didn't realize how expensive everything was going to be... is there any chance you can spot me until we get back?  I'll pay you back, I promise"".

Now I'm between a rock and a hard place. If I say no, he can't get home.  If I say yes, I may not be able to pay my own bills when we return, and might never get paid back.  Nothing good can come from this conversation.  

I gave in however, and asked him how much he needed.  After some hemming and hawing, he said $100 should cover everything.  Ok.  Borrowed him $100 - in cash.

Not two days later he's out of money again.  I'm pissed.  I tell him tough luck and the three of us go enjoy the day while he sleeps on the boat.  Paradise gets me back into a good mood though, and I start to feel bad.  *Yeah... I know.*  If he can't pay the ferry ride back, or the taxis, he's stranded in the Virgin Islands.  *This alone would make for a good AITA post if I just left him there*... but I begrudgingly decide borrow him money for the rest of the trip.  On the bright side, Sarah is having no problem paying her own way throughout the trip.

&amp;#x200B;

After we get back home I don't really talk to him much.  The trip, amazing as it was, has an underlying shitty feel to it all.  I feel taken advantage of and it bothers me that he, my best friend of so many years, was so selfish and entitled during the trip of a lifetime.  Captain obvious senses something is wrong and texts me that he will pay me back this weekend.  Weeks go by and nothing.  I confront him.  Turns out, he wasn't even keeping track of what he owed me!  Thank fuck I was - $373 just for the trip!!

I pull up his electric bills for the camper.  I charge him $0.13/kWh, send him monthly emails ""bills"" with pictures of the Kill-A-Watt meter, and allow 30 days to pay.  He's 90+ days late and hasn't paid anything. $115 behind.  Reminders answered with silence.  **It's the final straw, I'm fed up and go into asshole mode.**

&amp;#x200B;

I forward the electric bill emails, and tell him he has 5 business days (Tuesday) to pay all late bills in full, or I'll disconnect his electric service.  I also add a $20 late fee to all future bills that become late.  Weather forecast is for 20F at night.  No electricity = no heat and frozen/broken water lines.  I hear nothing back.

I have a face to face with him and express my general frustration about the trip, owed money and overdue electric bills.  He does his best to act sorry and promises to make things right.  I don't mention that I'm going to disconnect the power, but it was in the emails sent days earlier.

A few days later I invite him over for dinner, mostly to get the pictures he took on his phone during the trip.  He said he'd upload them, but was clearly dragging his feet with misc half-truths.  I **never** bring up that I'm killing the electric on Tuesday unless he pays just the late electric bills.  Unprompted, he says something like ""I'll pay you for the electric bills on Tuesday or Wednesday."" 

He knows he won't get paid until Wednesday.  I know he won't get paid until Wednesday, but he doesn't know that.  I still plan to pull the power Tuesday if he hasn't paid, but instead of saying that, I just say ""Ok.""

Ironically, the Kill-A-Watt meter fails a few hours later, killing his power.  15A heater + fridge + computer overloaded it.  He offers to pay for a new one (about $15) and I plug him back in unmetered.

Tuesday rolls along, and at 5pm I text him telling him I'm disconnecting the power in an hour unless all overdue electric bills are paid in full.  The following conversation ensues over text:

&amp;#x200B;

**Donny:** ""You couldn't have told me this yesterday?  I told you I'm gonna pay it tomorrow"" \[Wednesday\].

**Me:** ""It was in both emails.""

**Donny:** ""That's great.  Yesterday I told you I'm paying them all off, you didn't say anything""

**Me:** ""You say a lot of things.""

**Donny:** ""What's that supposed to mean exactly?""

 *- 10 minute pass -* 

**Donny:** ""Fine, I'll say it, my word means nothing to you.  I understand, rocky history, what do you want from me then?  An email?""

 *- 5 minutes pass -* 

**Donny:** ""I don't think I've made an email since high school lol""

 *- 30 minutes pass -* 

&amp;#x200B;

I disconnect his power at the breaker.  He drove off 5 minutes after that without saying a word, probably to go back to his mom's house for the night, or cry to our mutual friend about how he's been wronged.

24 hours later he said he'd be over at 7:30pm to pay his bill.  He showed up at 9:30pm acting like everything was all good and paid $200 - stating the extra money can go towards what he owes on the trip.  I tell him since the Kill-A-Watt meter failed, in a few days I'

We’re smoking some weed and one of my friends is also vaping this like synthetic CBD stuff. I tell how bad this stuff is prob for you and stuff like that all the time and that’s why I never do it.

Now my friend hit this stuff a lot and then after a while he pretends to have a literal seizure on the bed. I’m sitting here freaking the hell out cuz:

1. One of my best friends is having a seizure and I’m thinking he’s a bout to die 

2. I’m also thinking my parents are gonna prob gonna disown me and that this will be on my record so I’ll never be able to get a job (I know i was prob a lil dramatic)

And I’m freaking out this whole thinking I’m seeing my normal life crashing before me ,But then all of a sudden after 3-4 minutes of him there seizing the whole time. He just springs off the bed all better now. And I just collapse into a mental breakdown crying and everything cuz I thought my life was gonna be over.

So after all this and I calmed down after breaking down for 5 mins I’m just super pissed of at him.


So AMITA for being pissed off?

input:  

Bit of backstory:  
So I work part time and schedules for the most part are pretty random. Sometimes you can request certain days that you want to work, and so I always request Sunday, Monday, and Friday(and almost always get them). Our schedules always come out 1-2 weeks in advance so we have time to memorize our schedules. We use the when I work app which makes you confirm your schedules before you take them. This has worked very well up until last week. I always check my schedules when I get them and then the day before my shift just to double check everything.   
When they sent out the schedules for this week (October 29- November 4) I was scheduled to only work Friday November 2 and Sunday November 4, both from 4pm-8pm. This caught me by surprise as I wasn’t scheduled for Monday as I typically am, but I confirmed them anyway. So Sunday October 28 arrives and I had a shift that evening. I checked my schedule for the next 2 weeks as I had arrived to work early. My schedule was as previously mentioned.   
Monday after school my mother had an extremely important meeting that she couldn’t miss. This meeting was from 5:00-9:30 and was half an hour away from were we live. Since I didn’t have work my mother told me I had to babysit my siblings until she got home. Everything was fine until about 5:15 when I got a text from my GM asking if I was running late to work. As I wasn’t scheduled for work I was very confused and asked if they texted the wrong person since my next shift wasn’t until Friday. They said no and sent a screenshot of the When I Work app saying I had a shift from 5-9:30. I checked the app and it asked me to confirm a shift for Monday 5-9:30. This shift had not been there less than 24 hours earlier when I had last checked. On top of that my Friday shift was changed to 5-10:30 and my Sunday shift was canceled entirely. I apologized but told the GM that I couldn’t come in as I had to babysit my siblings. They ended up working down a member, although luckily the store wasn’t too busy. AITA for not showing up?  
TL:DR   
Didn’t show up for work due to a last minute schedule change I was unaware of and had prior obligations to fulfill. Store was down a member the whole night. AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: I(m-14) have been living with my mom for about the past 7 years (coming up on 8) and given the short opportunity to live with my dad. (This coming from a bed bug outbreak where I had to relocate.) I usually live with my mom on the weekdays and go to my dad's on the weekend. 

However, over the past couple of months or so, I've been living with my dad and doing occasional visits to my mom's house to reset my room so we can get new flooring. Usually, when I was asked if I was moving back over there, I would say that yes, eventually once the situation evened out, I'd be back. 

My parents live very close to each other, maybe 5-7 blocks apart, very close, walking distance, even.

Recently, however, I've considered staying with my dad reverse the old schedule (m-f dad, s-s mom). Just about 30 minutes ago, I told my mom that I liked my dad's house way more. I have my computer and Oculus rift here, I have an actual monitor here, my dad lets me go out way more, and I don't have to constantly be around 4 very annoying siblings who are nearly never quiet. My WiFi is way better and I'm expected to do well in school, otherwise I will have my things taken away. But here's where I think the infraction lies: I told my mom that I liked my dad more than her, only when she asked. That is the truth, but I feel like I overstepped and should have just lied. On the other hand, my mom has had near full custody over me since they divorced in 2011(~?). I'm insanely worried that I might've set her anxiety off, and I fell bad. I've told her I love her, but I just like my dad more. AITA?

tl;dr: I didn't want to live at my mom's 5/7 of the week, said I liked my dad more and wanted to live w/ him.

Now complete the following example-
input: Hey everyone. My friend has been overeating and not exercising at all for years now. I really want to tell him to start exercising before his health conditions get worse, but he's very sensitive about the whole topic. Everytime someone raises the issue (privately, not in front of others), he acts like the victim and says he will do what he wants. 

The thing is, he subscribes to various health subreddits, and likes reading up on different diets/workouts. So i think deep down wants to get fitter, but just doesnt have the motivation.

Yet, when someone raises it up, he throws a tantrum and claims everyone is against him. 

So will i be the asshole if i raise it up with him? And how should i go about doing it since he's so sensitive about it?

Now complete the following example-
input: Firstly, I normally wouldn't have an issue with it but there are certain circumstances this time. Also worth noting, smoking is prohibited in and at my apartment complex.

&amp;#x200B;

It's finals week right now and I had my last final today that happened to be for the class I've been struggling in all quarter. All of my housemates knew about this final as well. This morning, I woke up to a really strong smell of weed. I knew it was the smell of weed because my body reacts very negatively towards it i.e. I get extremely nauseous and a pounding headache. This happened right before (half an hour) my final. 

&amp;#x200B;

I knew which housemate it was coming from because the smell was coming from her room. Earlier this school year, she told me that her girlfriend smokes weed for health reasons, but said she would never do it in the apartment, only in her car or outside. She has done it 4-5 times inside now since January, and each time I just left for a while. This housemate, however, has known for a while how my body reacts to the smell. I slightly confronted her by asking if she knew why our apartment smelled of weed, and she immediately got defensive saying she doesn't smoke weed. I never insinuated that she did; merely just wanted to know if she knew who was smoking it or if anyone cooked something that resembles the smell. 

&amp;#x200B;

The nausea and headache affected my performance on the final today as I was unable to focus as much as I wanted to. I messaged the group chat of my housemates, excluding the suspected housemate because she doesn't want another housemate having her number, and stated that it smells of weed in our apartment and that I would really appreciate it if whoever it was smoking it would refrain from doing it inside our apartment as it makes me physically ill. No one acknowledged it so I emailed the resident manager, who deals with apartment issues. I didn't ask him to confront the housemates, I didn't even state who I thought was doing it. I just stated the situation, how it affects me, and asked if he knew how I should personally handle the situation (callback to the strict no-smoking policy). When I told my parents what I did, they freaked out and said I was being a complete asshole and that I should've just ignored it and let it go. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, AITA?
output: ",going to the resident manager because my housemate's girlfriend keeps smoking weed in the apartment

Now complete the following example-
input: I have two things to begin with:
1.) I'm on mobile, so I'm sorry for the weird format.
2.) I'm underage and unable to move away from my brother.

So my brother and I have never been very close (besides when we were babies-toddlers). I have tried many times to build/ rebuild a/our relationship. I've tried playing video games he likes, letting him use my phone (he doesn't have one), and giving him mobile hotspot in the car. I know these are superficial things, but that's what my brother's into. 

Every time I try to do something with my brother he ends up screaming at me, and I end up in my room crying. Many times I have barricaded myself in my room so that I don't have to worry about him coming in. My brother seems to only care about one thing, his X-box/video games, so I'm not sure if he'd care if when I moved out we'd stop talking.

I wouldn't cut out complete contact with him because of my parents and holidays and such, but I wouldn't talk to him if I didn't have to. I really would like to lose all contact with my immediate family, but I feel like that'd be too stressful, so I figure the next best thing is my brother. 

I love my brother, but I'm not sure if he loves me. So WIBTA for not talking to my brother?

Now complete the following example-
input: I am a college student who has always been a pretty busy person. I usually work and go to school while having a boyfriend and personal expectations where I am currently living (with him). We are trying to get an apartment and better careers. I also am trying to eventually do something with art, so when I get free time I try to paint or do things with that. So, I am generally a busy person and for a couple years have learned what it is like to not really give time for myself.  

This semester I took off work to go to school full time to ease stress and try to do more stuff for myself. I have a lot of friends and a lot of family who always are trying to see me and message me (as good friends and family should) and I do my best to see everyone and talk as I can but it has always been so hard. Sometimes it's less stressful to just sleep or get errands done that I've put off then constantly worrying about replying to everyone.

 In high school I had a good group of friends but never was one of those people who cared about social status and things, so keeping friends happy wasn't usually hard for me. 

As I've gotten older, and it's getting harder to see everyone, over the years people's patience with me seems to be growing thin and I always feel the need to say sorry for not replying in a timely manner and not seeing people for a while. I understand their p.o.v... , like my one couple friends had a baby before Christmas and I still haven't met the baby or talked with them (or anyone else)  too much for the past few months and I'm pretty sure my friends are upset with me about it.. I am planning meet up with them tomorrow because of it, but still.

I don't know how to feel. I feel like an asshole because yeah I'm getting bothered with everyone's expectations of me when all I am trying to do is focus on making my life for myself (and trying to do what I want for a change) and everyone is more concerned with seeing/hearing from me, but at the same time I am glad they care and I do want to see and hear from them, I just want them to be understanding of my time and how I use it too.. and if that means not talking for a few months, then so be it.. right..? 

So guys, am I the asshole for not putting more time into my friends and family?

To sum it up: I am a super busy college student working to get her life together and I don't have a lot of time for others or myself. My friends and family are getting upset for not seeing me as much as they want. And I don't know if I should feel bad or not.

Now complete the following example-
input: I host a private Teamspeak server which is an application for talking to other people over the internet (VOIP) like Skype or Discord that my \~15 friends and I have used for communication while playing video games or collaborate on homework or just hang out for several years now. I've known one the longest, Cameron (not real name). Over the years, he never really changed and I saw him as immature, but didn't ever really mind letting him tag along with whatever we were doing or playing). Many more years go by and he becomes more of a mutual acquaintance than a friend and he only ever really talks to a couple of people every once in a while on the server. When the game PUBG came out, only 3 of us want to play it, but the game is best with 4 people, so someone suggests we invite Cameron, who also likes the game. After a few weeks of playing it, we had one game where he got particularly mad at me for dying stupidly at the very end which gave the win to the other remaining team. I sarcastically apologized and said that it was only one round and he should chill. The next round, the three non-Camerons of us are playing seriously because everything is lining up well this round, while he decides to go off and play stupidly to spite me. Partially for comedic effect and partially because I was annoyed, I shot him, then proceeded to hold him on the edge of being revived so that neither he nor I could accomplish anything. He gets really pissed and starts cursing, screaming, and raging about it, so I temporarily mute him in the server to spare our ears. He immediately messages me through Steam threatening to leak my IP address on the dark web. I didn't take this threat lightly because we know that he buys drugs and does shit in Tor all the time, so I decide to ban him from the teamspeak server, block him on Steam, and call my ISP to ask for a new static IP. Everyone else decides that it was warranted and that he was toxic to have around anyways, so they sever ties as well. I didn't really ban him over one outburst that he might have only said in the moment and regretted, but a string of asshole-ish things that he had done leading up to that. Fast forward about a year later and he has maintained friendship with those who still go to the same school via physical contact, and they decide they want to start a playthrough of Civilization 6. They ask if I will allow Cameron back on the server, which I refuse. Most of my friends think that I am too stubborn for holding this grudge and that I should just let it go, as I don't even have to talk to him, and Cameron thinks that I am just abusing my power as the only admin of my server to be a dictator and not allow him back. I won't unban him because I have a feeling that he has built some plan to get back at me (I promise I'm not paranoid, he's just like that). So, AITA for not unbanning him?

input: I'm a 5'8"" woman. Kind of tall for female I always thought. I don't see men in a romantic or sexual way if they're shorter than me. I've always felt this way. I'm very self concious of my height and around shorter guys I always feel lke I'm half giant like Hagrid. Same height and up is fine. I've talked to a handful of lads about this and they say I'm shallow. (They're a little taller than me, not even short.) I just feel as though it's preference. 

I recently went on a Tinder date with a guy who I was semi-interested in. Not too much, but enough to give it a shot. When I got there he was about 5'2"" or something (His tinder bio said 5'10 but that's besides the point). I had a nice chat but his personality wasn't for me. It happens. I mentioned to my friend that his height turned me off anyway, and he lied about his height too. 

My friend then said I shouldn't decline him if he's short, I should have just screwed him and left. (I was looking for sexual partners at the time) but people shorter than me turn me off big time. Like I mentioned I feel like a half giant. Because I expressed this notion, he started ranting about how men can't control their height so you shouldn't have a height preference.

Tl;dr:  I have a preference for same height guys or taller. I don't have sexual or romantic interest in shorter guys.

Now complete the following example-
input: My roommate and I have lived together for over two years at this point. During this time, we've both been fairly messy as we've gone through various stuff in life, and are mid-twenties dudes. We've lived with other awful roommates, and have always gotten along great. At this point, it's just us and one other guy who we like. All three of us have been very close friends for over 10 years.

Since we moved into this apartment last year, which is nicer than anywhere we've lived before, we've both expressed the desire to keep this place clean. It's been okay, but is still messy. The thing is, I am a lot cleaner than him. I am take the trash out literally 90% of the time. I have been the ONLY person to clean our bathroom the entire time we've lived here (the third roommate has his own). He's gone on week-long-vacation a couple of times and has left a bunch of dishes out.

The thing is, I feel partially responsible because I haven't ever really complained about it to him before.

Recently, he's been really depressed. His girlfriend moved across the country a month ago, and he got laid off from his job a week ago. He's gained a lot of weight, and while I've tried to do what I can to be there for him, I can't exactly take responsibility for his mental health.

Over the last few weeks, it's gotten to the point where I come home from working 10 hour days every day and spend 20 minutes cleaning the kitchen, sweeping, etc, before I even feel like I can sit down and relax. I tried to really gently bring it up, and he was amicable -- but nothing has changed. If I try to bring it up more forcefully, given what he's going through, would I be an asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: Yesterday I got into a shouting match with my uncle when he and his kids were at my apartment to pick up computer parts.

For some background info, my uncle's family has a cat too and they basically treat it like an action figure. They got it declawed because it kept scratching the kids, and then took it back to get declawed again on its back legs since it had started kick scratching them. I've seen the kids literally pull it out from under the couch by its tail when they want to play with it because it hides from them whenever they come into the room. 

Because of this, I told them that if they visit my apartment they aren't allowed to interact with my cat in any way, and I made sure to put her in a carrier just in case. As soon as they get there the kids immediately run over and start shaking the carrier, and I got mad and told them to leave. My uncle argued with me until I was shouting and threatening to call the cops before he agreed to leave, and I told them they would have to pick up the computer parts from my parents because they aren't allowed in my apartment ever again.

After this both of my parents and my grandma left angry messages on my phone telling me that I needed to apologize to them for the way I acted, because that is no way to treat family. I don't want to because I think they were being cruel to my cat after I made them specifically agree not to and now everyone is on my case about ""breaking up the family over a cat"" since my uncle doesn't want to talk to my parents until they get me under control. Am I in the wrong here? I honestly feel justified but literally no one is taking my side so I am questioning whether I was too forceful.

input: Last Christmas I started my Christmas shopping the day before Christmas, and was put under severe stress.

I decided to turn things around and started extremely early. At the midst of October (say around 16th of October), I stumbled across the perfect item in Etsy for a family member. I immediately ordered it.

And so one month passes by, and I am starting to become significantly worried. The app is rumoured as safe. So I relax. (money has been pulled off my bank account) Sunday marked the day that I had been patiently waiting for two months. I had received no parcel number, nor formal shipping disclaimer, yet my order was scheduled to ship almost two months ago (circa ten days after ordering). I decided to message the person, and got an automatic message saying that they '*did not take orders*' I fanatically messaged my friend (who has experience on this app) and she strongly advised me to report as soon as possible as they might want to take my money. 

So I reported them. I stated clearly that ''**I'd prefer a refund, but if this company still has the item I am still open for receiving it**'' I further on also explained what happened when I tried messaging this company. 

Today I receive a response from a pissed shop owner telling me I did not have the patience to wait for 24h before reporting and that she could not work due to a recently broken arm. After reading this I apologized for my behaviour, but they kept on going on a rampage that I was the worst costumer ever ''*and I have experienced a lot of bad ones*''. I Feel really bad for reporting this company to the app a couple of hours later. 

So am I the ignorant asshole here?

Im at a red light at an intersection. There was a minor accident and traffic was backed up. Traffic was getting heavy and there was no more room or else cars would get caught in the middle of the intersection. Three cars decided to try and make it through. The light changed and 3 cars were blocking us in the intersection. 

There was no way they could move in time so I laid on my horn. The people blocking us flipped me off, so I blew my horn even longer. Since these idiots blocked the intersection we missed our light cycle. I was furious so I kept blowing on my horn. Finally after missing 2 light cycles we made it through.

Now, the thing is, there's an ok amount of room in the freezer still.  Sure, we need to stack lunches on top of each other, but it's not like the fish is taking up all of our space.

Now complete the following example-
input: I sound like the asshole in the title, but let me elaborate. Let's call her Beth.

Beth and I were closest friends for the last year or so, but have distanced apart because she has spent 95% of her attention on her boyfriend and 5% on me and other friends. Beth has seemed to, for some reason, grow clingy to her boyfriend and barely even talks to us anymore. Even her boyfriend is uncomfortable with it.

I got accepted into a program where I would move to a different campus in our high school for next year, and since Beth didn't seem to care for me and my other friends got accepted, I decided to take the opportunity. Beth gave zero fucks. Until she found out her boyfriend would be moving countries next year (by his choice - who wouldn't take that opportunity?)

We had already distanced, but when we did talk, she told me how she wishes someone would prioritise her over opportunities, since she'll be lonely next year. I wanted to say the biggest fuck you because she never wanted to go out with us as friends, but accepted every opportunity possible with her boyfriend, always went to sit next to him during class and never put effort into our friendship in general.

This one particular time, I mentioned how I would miss a teacher, since I'd be moving campuses. This was after Beth found out her boyfriend was leaving, and she could only reply, ""Well maybe you shouldn't go"". She also tried to guilt trip her boyfriend into not moving overseas (""If you loved me you would stay"")

But then again, what if I'm doing this out of pettiness? I'm planning to completely cut ties with her next year, since we won't see each other much and she's put next to no effort into our friendship, but SUDDENLY wants me to stay on the same campus as her, since she'll be lonely if I don't. Can I just move on from this? Am I the asshole for ditching her ass completely? I'm taking the campus opportunity regardless, but would I be the asshole for cutting ties?

tl;dr: close friend has put little to no effort into our relationship since she got with her boyfriend, gave no shits when I said I'd be moving campuses, suddenly gave a shit when she found out her boyfriend was voluntarily moving overseas, and has now tried to subtly guilt trip us both into staying with her. It's bullshit and it pisses me off, but am I the asshole for wanting to cut ties with her too?

Now complete the following example-
input: Okay, this is a slightly complicated story.

I broke up with Nick in September. 

I never really got over Nick, we broke up because he moved about three hours away and the relationship became really difficult to maintain. In addition, I was having some health issues that meant I couldn’t be the best partner.

In October, Mike asked me out. Mike and Nick were casual friends while I dated Nick. 

I didn’t really know what to do, because I hadn’t really had an interest in Mike before. Not that I was actively disinterested, I just didn’t know him very well. 

I ended up going on a few dates with Mike. The relationship was weird.

Mike honestly struck me as a bit of a psychopath. He was completely unable of expressing emotion, and honestly said some really scary stuff.

Mostly comments about violence towards himself and others that made me really on edge.

A mutual friend named Ellie was like, well that’s just how mike is. He doesn’t mean it he’s just a little bit quirky. 

I slept with Mike once and it was... not good. It was his first time but he didn’t even try.

Afterwards he told me he realized he didn’t like sex and never wanted to have it again.

At this point I was pretty done with Mike, and we didn’t go on any other dates but continued to hang out during school.

I ended up running into Nick the day before thanksgiving. Mike had flown out of the country for thanksgiving a week prior. He hadn’t replied to any of my messages and I was really frustrated with him.

Nick ends up explaining to me that he moved back, and that he missed me. I went over to his place to see his dog and talk, one thing leads to another and we end up making up and having sex.

Later that day, I’m sitting with Nick and it hits me. Crap, I haven’t officially broken up with Mike.

I was so sick of him and his weird behavior at this point so I just fired off a text “hey, I think we should break up”. He replied within the hour “Yeah, we probably should”.

It’s January now and I’m still with Nick but I occasionally feel twinges of guilt about mike. He’s never expressed any anger and knows I’m back with nick.

In a lot of ways I feel like the relationship was dead before then but I’m curious what others think.


So, tell me reddit: AITA for dumping Mike for Nick?

I'm Split in two. On one hand i spent alot of my years as a kid moving about to different places, Staying on islands, In big city's.

Now complete the following example-
input: Throwaway account. Let me preface this by saying that I’m a 20 year old guy in college pursuing music production so in a way I guess I sort of feel like I’m being a really lame party pooper for this.

I understand that a music degree by itself won’t land me a “job”, rather I plan on using music school for connections within the industry and professional mentorship, and also to help build my skills as an electronic/alternative musician. That being said I’ve been told that it’s very important to put yourself out there and be social with other people in the industry (musicians, promoters, djs, rappers/vocalists, event planners, etc). 

I know not every scene is like this but as a producer from la/Long Beach I typically end up partying/hanging out with a lot of trap/rap producers, hard edm producers, and of course rappers. And boy do they like being all sorts of inebriated. And honestly I’m guilty of it too... on multiple occasions. But I honestly feel like it’s really started to take a toll on my mental health and I just can’t focus on work like I should be able to. 

I drink sometimes but weed has usually been my drug of choice, and while I definitely think I’ve been more creative under the influence I’ve never ever been able to finish a song high. And also I’m starting to realize that I’m creative regardless of being faded and it’s just that weed exaggerates my feelings so I always enjoy my music way more while I’m on it, even if it’s just a simple beat or melody. 

Another thing is that one of my friends in this group is trying to start a collective sort of thing where we do shows and podcasts and promote our own music on our website and I’m sort of the co founder. We haven’t even had our first show yet but I don’t think I can work with someone who’s been doing drugs since middle school and doesn’t realize most of his problems stem from that. I know that’s probably not a good enough reason to not want to work with someone but he’s super hard headed and impulsive especially when he’s high (which is like almost every day usually) so yeeeah.

As I’m typing this I’m realizing it might be obvious to some, and I’m sure I’ll get responses saying that I can still have the same friends but just refrain from drug use, but you are who you surround yourself with...and I honestly just need someone I can jam/make music with sober or even just go out to lunch for a couple of hours and just talk. 

TLDR: I realize I need to be sober for a while but my current friend group was formed on the basis of partying/drinking/smoking, so I’m thinking that hanging around them isn’t exactly in my best interest.

She hasn’t.  When I come home the place is a mess.  When I want some food we have to order take out.

input: I'll make this short since it was really dumb. My mom is super pissed at me for two reasons today. A) I made a joke on Facebook she deemed inappropriate, B) After she ranted to me on messenger about how terrible I was and I should be ashamed of myself I told her ""sorry I'll take it down, but for future reference you can just tell me you didn't like what I said and I'll take it down no questions asked, no need for a lecture.""
Wrong fucking response apparently, came home to a superbly pissed off parent who couldn't believe my nerve and she's refusing to talk to me if I don't apologize. I am an adult and do live with my parents, that's the only reason I took down the original comment (my dad thought it was hilarious btw) but I really don't think I did anything wrong/ owe her an apology.

Now complete the following example-
input: I live with my best friend and my partner, I’ve recently broken my ankle and can’t move around very well and after being pretty active this is an incredibly stressful and frustrating time for me.

I’ve told my friends that not only am I going through this and it’s completely not their fault if I’m pissy, but I have bipolar and it really isn’t their fault if I’m getting really down and I’ve struggled with it for a while but I know how to deal with it. I have also told them that if I’m in a mood, I give clear warning and tell them that it’s really me and I need to get over it just please don’t try to make me feel better because that’s now how it works. 

My partner gets it, and I’m friends with a lot of guys and they seem to just roll over it like they don’t care. 

But my best friend knew I was having a ‘pissy’ day, or not my best day. And she’s asked me if I want to get dinner, if I want to go to one of our friends houses, if I want to go out, if I’m okay to go out drinking in my moonboot, and I just kept it really light with, ‘I need to get homework done’ ‘I need to clean the room’ ‘I need to do laundry’ 

And she came in and asked ‘can I watch TV with you’ and I said, ‘do you have to?’ Because I didn’t know how else to say it, like I’m in my pjs, in my bed with my ankle strapped and unable to move, I’ve got no underwear or bra on, I’m just not in a space for anyone other than my partner to be in. (My partner works night shift so he’s gone.) 

She said ‘oh my god you’re so mean to me!’ 

AITA because despite having told my friend all but leave me alone, that I don’t want to watch TV.

Now complete the following example-
input: I have an antique confederate battle flag framed in my home office. The flag has quite a storied history. First carried into WWII by my grandfather, it was then carried into Vietnam by my uncle, who passed away a few years ago. They do not have any ties to white supremacy nor did they hold any racist views. The flag is a family heirloom, not a political statement.

My wife was hosting a baby shower for a friend of hers. Out of nowhere, one of her friend's guests stepped out into the living room holding the very same framed flag above her head. She claimed she was looking for the bathroom when she opened the door to my office by mistake (very unlikely).

Even when my wife explained the history behind the flag, she made a huge scene. During her rant about how her ancestors were slaves, she violently threw the frame on the ground, cracking the antique frame that had been in my family for three generations and sending glass shards all over the wooden floor. My wife's foot was cut quite badly by the glass, requiring three stitches. 

Long story short- cops were called, she was arrested, and charges will be filed. I have also retained a lawyer to go after her in civil court. As she works in the healthcare field, I am told a criminal record will be quite damaging to her career though it won't end it entirely. 

My wife's friend apologized profusely for her guest's behavior and has offered to pay for any damages (I thanked her but I won't make her pay for someone else's mistake), but she made a comment about how I was overreacting and that I shouldn't ruin a young woman's life over this. She also said my flag should be in storage or a museum, not out on display. 

I understand the outrage at display of the flag in public buildings, but I feel like this was different. I did not have my flag out in my front yard, it wasn't in my living room, it was in my private office, behind closed doors. Moreso, her irrational behavior caused my wife to be injured. I don't know if I would want someone like her working in a hospital setting. Am I an asshole for thinking this girl was way out of line?

Now complete the following example-
input: I know a lot of posts on this subreddit are obviously YTA or NTA, but I'm really not sure about this one so here it goes.

I started seeing this girl recently. She has been great and it has been going fine, but here roommate isn't exactly the coolest. She is super NYC fake rich white girl, a vibe that I know well as an NYC resident. I don't usually care that much as there are a lot of fake people here in NYC at my age and I have learned to deal with them.

I had hung out with my now girlfriend and her roommate before, but she \[the roommate\] was always extremely standoffish. She would never talk to me directly, usually jump at the opportunity to mock, and was just unpleasant around me. Whatever! Fuck fake people I have 10 million others to connect with.

However, me dating my now girlfriend has sparked up the instinct part of every white girl wherein they are determined to become besties with you because you are now dating their friend. My girlfriend even said she wants to ""re-introduce ourselves"". This REALLY rubs me the wrong way because she has been a majorly uncool person to me before and now I auto-magically gain acceptable status. (If she wanted to be cool she would have before!) I really don't want to ""re-introduce"" myself and been actively saying no to invites to events by my girlfriend because I really don't want to be around this person. I know this seems kinda petty, and I'm sure that she would behave more appropriately now that she knows we are going to be in closer contact, but that fucks me up even more cause I really don't want that fake-ness in my life.

AITA for not giving her a second chance, or am I justified in just blocking her out?

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm 19F and live with mom who is widowed at 54. I like to have everything in a particular place: laptop on the table, pens on the right of that, paper on the left, etc. I hoard things that hold sentimental value that I can't find myself letting go of too.

I introduced mom to the KonMari method of cleaning and living lifestyle and she's been thrilled to try it out. It's been really good to her and the house has already felt more comfortable and joyful :) Told her I want to do my own room and things on my own time. Haven't done so yet b/c of school and work, you know how it goes.

Got home from a late shift tonight and walked into my room with all of my clothes piled onto the bed and things gathered into one area (per the KonMari method) and mom going through everything to put into ""sparks joy"" or ""doesn't spark joy"" piles.

I ask mom why she's going through my room and look around for important things I don't want to lose. Can't find them, start panicking, and ask more aggressively and angrily. I got very upset and said things like ""what the fuck is wrong with you"", ""get the hell out"", saying/interrupting her saying ""fuck you"" every time she tried to explain herself, slammed the door when she left, and said that she had no right to go through my things. The only thing she could fully ask was to have me stop swearing at her. She was calm the entire time and left without questioning it.

I've never cussed at my mom before. I never say the lesser words like ""damn"" or ""shit"" with her. I hardly say ""crap"" because I know she doesn't like it. As soon as she left and I could recompose myself I sat down and cried. I don't know why I did that, and I don't know why I reacted that way. I may be overthinking it, but maybe I need to get diagnosed for OCD since I realize get extremely uncomfortable when anything of mine is out of place or touched by someone else.

I feel like I'm rightfully angry to be mad since she went through my things even though I explicitly told her I'd organize it myself, but I feel awful that I had such an outburst and I don't know where it stemmed from. I don't know where to go from here.

input: Weird title, weird situation.

We've been officially together for 4 months, as in exclusively but weve known eachother for seven.

To put it simply, she cries during sex. Full tears. Not so much at first but when we're really speeding up and when we finish. Just bawling, sometimes silent tears and other times sort of moaning/crying.

First time this happened i stopped because i thought i was either hurting her or she was having a flashback or something. She immediately wipes her tears and asks why i stopped. Completely normal again, even confused like im the odd one.

She says that she cries during sex when shes nearing orgasm. She states it matter of factly. Now im not super experienced so maybe this is a common thing women do but i have never heard of it.

She says when she cries like that she doesn't want me to stop. Ive had sex with her multiple times and its always the same. I ask her to hold it back but she cries anyway. I ask her if she hates when we have sex but she says she likes it. I ask her if shes ever been abused and she says no.

Like i said i dont know if this is normal for women when they orgasm but i told her that she may need to see a therapist. She is angry at me for being ""obsessive"" about it and shaming her supposedly. 

I just want, idk, for women to look like they enjoy having sex with me? Lmao AITA?

input: I met the guy on tinder and we went out to a bar. While we were out, he tells me he has a son from unprotected sex with a woman he had a one night stand with when he was 18. Doesn't bother me at all, we hit it off and go back to my apartment.

Things heated up and he wanted to put it in without a condom. I said ""you already have one kid, are you really trying for another one right now?"" He got kind of upset and told me not to talk about his son like that. I apologized and we ended up getting it on (with protection!)

I feel kind of bad now because it never occurred to me that my joke could be offensive. AITA?

input: Sorry for formatting, on mobile. TL:DR at bottom

I (25m) and my friend (25f) went out to have a drink after work as we normally do. We both work at the same place and I just so happened to be getting out earlier than her tonight so the plan was I was going to drink while I waited for her, sober up when she's there, and go home when I'm feeling ok. I finish my drink by the time she arrives and around 20 mins into her getting there she orders me a drink.

While at the bar waiting I had decided that I was just gonna have the one, wait for her to get there, and get out when I sober up which wouldn't have been more than an hour and a half. She didn't know this and me not wanting to fight with her about a drink she was paying for I reluctantly accepted. So I was forced to stay a little later than I would have liked.

Around 11 this group of guys shows up, typical middle aged drinking at the bar because it's very cheap type of guys. They start doing shots with everyone in the bar, I refuse and my friend accepts the shot offer. She ended up doing roughly 5 shots of Petrone along with her 3 other drinks she had earlier.

A 6th shot comes for her and she refused to do it so she goes around the bar to the group of guys and gets one of them to drink it for her. The guy that took the shot only did it if she would let him get to know her as he grabbed at her waist and pulled her into himself. Immediately after hearing that I went into dad mode where I was staring this guy down. He did the shot and she went back over to chat and this guy would not let his hands off her.

She knows the bartender very well and trusts her as well as a bar regular that we've both become acquainted with, so I know if I leave they'll watch out for her. But this dude had a very creepy vibe going on about him and he was sitting with the group of guys that came in together so I stayed just to be safe.

She was pretty tipsy and I was worried about her so I ended up taking her keys to make sure she couldn't drive off anywhere, probably not the best move but it's the one that came to me at the time.

Bar is closing down and tabs are being collected and she's still chatting with the dude. Finally comes over the pay her tab and I tell her that I was concerned about her getting home and either we were going to sit in the parking lot until she sobered up or I would drive her home. She told me I wasn't driving her home and assured me we'd wait in the parking lot. She goes back over to chat with the dude

Bartender is kicking people out at 1 and after about 10 mins I tell the bartender that when she comes over to get her stuff to tell her I have her keys and I'll be waiting in my car. Wait in my car for about 20 mins until she finally comes out with the dude and immediately gets angry at me for taking her keys. I tell her calmly that I need her to get in my car because I need to have a chat with her, which she finally accepts. I have her the keys, she reads me the riot act for doing what I did. I apologized to her, told her I understood where she was coming from and why she's angry with me, and told her that I was just looking out for her and I only did it because I care about her. So AITA for this?

TL:DR. Friends and I went drinking. She had to many shots of Petrone. Offloads her last shot on a creepy guy that is very handsy with her. I pull a dad move and take her keys to make sure she can't leave

input: Brace up, this is going to be a weird ride. 

TL;DR: I got an earthquake warning app that sometimes gives false positives, which scare some of my coworkers. I could get the paid version to get rid of false positives, but I make a matter of principle to not pay for apps. 

I live in Mexico City, which was hit by two strong earthquakes in late 2017. After that, most people got at least a bit traumatized. Every time we get an earthquake warning we get almost triggered because... well, earthquakes. 

Now, a couple months ago I downloaded an app that is linked to a seismograph network and gives you a warning one or two minutes in advance of an earthquake so you can get to a safe place. 

The problem is that the app has two levels of warnings: One for earthquakes in general, and another for earthquakes strong enough to cause damage. 

Of course, the first ones are a lot more common. Once or twice a month my cellphone will go off with a loud warning of ""Earthquake detected, low intensity"". In a year or so, I've never had a warning of an earthquake that poses actual danger. 

That means everytime the alarm goes off me and my coworkers (if I'm at work) get a bit of a scare until the ""low intensity"" part comes through. Again, this happens around once or twice a month. 

I personally think it's better to have a lot of false positives than a single false negative, so I put up with that. However, some of my coworkers think the scares are not worth it. And the city has an earthquake warning system throug high volume speakers that, in theory, gives you a similar level of warning than the app. I just want the extra level of security here. 

Now, there is an option: The paid version of the app allows you to only receive warnings about earthquakes that are actually dangerous. But first of all, I don't like getting apps I have to pay for, as a matter of principle. And second, I think Google already has enough of my information to give them my finnancial information as well. So, I am entirely against paying for the app. 

So... is it wrong if I'm willing to put up with some false positive but my coworkers are not so okay with that? Should I do without the app or pay for it?

Now complete the following example-
input: As the totals suggests, I [28m] and my wife [27f] have been trying for a child for about 6 months. There are a couple factors at play here as to why we may be having difficulties, so my thought is to rule out as much as possible. She has a bleeding disorder and a family history of ovarian cysts, and I am a bit concerned about whether or not we will even be able to have children. 
Yesterday, we found out that for yet another month, we were unsuccessful. In my frustration, I put my hands on my head and she immediately followed with “why are you making this about you?” I tried to explain that I was struggling with each month getting our hopes up and that she probably felt the same way. She didn’t want to hear my side and it ended in an argument about how I “make it about me.” I can understand how I could have put my feelings aside, but in the moment after hearing a “no” again, I was a bit distraught.
I followed up by suggesting that she go and get a check up. For the last 9 months she has been without insurance (quit her job to pursue a dream of hers, and has no benefits). I recently was able to get her on my benefits, and so this is a possibility. She is making the claim that it is her body, and that it is her decision. I can’t force her to go get checked up. 
Her big Hangup is that doctors typically say that you need to try to conceive for 1 year before bothering them with any concerns of issues with pregnancy. We are at month 6. I suggested that my wife tell a white lie (how will they know when we started anyway?) in order to find out if there are any issues with her bleeding disorder, or cysts. She again reiterated that it isn’t my choice, and that she wanted to wait for a year. 
Again, I am only hoping to rule out medical concerns for conceiving. I in no way an accusatory or think that it is “her fault.” Hell, the problem might even be me? But AITA for asking or requesting that she goes and gets a checkup for issues conceiving?

Now complete the following example-
input: So there's this friend of mine that I met at a party back in April 2017. We've known each other a while now and grew really close in around 6 months. We'd be there for each other when needed in the early months of our relationship and towards October, we'd grown really close. I'd seen her every weekend from October 12th to November 8th and we'd talk almost daily. 

She's been a great friend to me and has done a lot that means very much to me (my dad, brother, her and two close friends of mine threw me a surprise birthday party on the 25th of October and she'd not only baked me a cake, handled most of the decorations, painted me a picture of the album cover for Ten by Pearl Jam; a favorite of mine, all during mid-terms) but as of November, she's become awfully distant.

We barely talk and when we do, it's normally me who initiates the conversation. We hang out like once a month and she normally postpones frequently, making it difficult to, well, hang out. This in contrast to the fact that she used to message ""I miss you guys"" to our group when we'd hung out like 3 days ago makes me wonder what happened.

For more context, after the whole birthday thing, I'd developed feelings for her and eventually told her 2 weeks later, I didn't do anything extra like ""I wanna spend the rest of my life with you"", just ""I like you as more than just a friend"" to which she told me she didn't feel the same way. After that, I began to fear that I'd driven a wedge into our relationship and was on edge when things started to deteriorate. I asked if our distance had anything to do with my feelings and whether it made her uncomfortable, but she said it had nothing to do with me. 

Now though, she's in a relationship with someone and over the course of 2 months, I've seen her twice. Like I said above, she barely texts and frequently postpones. Sometimes her excuses don't add up because she says one thing like ""I'm broke and can't go out"" and then she goes out the next day (I know because my friends and I follow the group of friends she spends time with now). I feel wrong for doubting her but she's been giving me nothing but excuses and I don't know whether I should just believe her because she's a good person or doubt her because the facts don't add up. As of a few hours ago, she got  back from a day out with her friends. She'd told me 2 days ago that she was completely out of money for all of January since she'd asked for her January allowance in advance and wouldn't be able to hang out at all. When I'd suggested asking her younger sister to pay for her since she's against friends paying for her, she'd said ""that's a nono"" and I'd just conceded, but that's exactly what happened today. I asked her why she changed her mind but she told me I didn't have to question everything she did, to which I agreed. 

She told me a while back that she didn't want things to change between us after the whole confession thing but it feels like she's just avoiding me at this point. I feel like I'm wrong for doubting her and questioning the things she says but at the same time, I feel like if I don't know what's wrong, neither of us can make an effort to fix it.

Tl;dr - friend who I grew really close to suddenly started being distant, and giving me excuses for why she can't hang out with me and my friends. I wanna know why we grew so distant and why her stories don't add up, but feel guilty for doing so because she's a good person. Help.

input: Hi Reddit! So I’m 18f and I’m a senior in high school right now. I’ve applied to a bunch of colleges and gotten accepted to a few that I really like (re: a tiny little college I got to visit and fell in love with and is also relatively cheap to go to on scholarship), but I DIDN’T apply for our local public university. It’s a great school, but I’ve been waiting my whole life to leave the state (and telling everyone I meet that I’m gonna move away ASAP), and I really would rather not.

The university is only about 45 min from my house, and my mom wants me to go there so that I can go to school and live at home to save me some money. But things have always been really tense with my mom (she has a tendency to blow up small things and then ignore me until I apologize even if I wasn’t in the wrong), and I’ve been looking forward to the idea of not having to be around her as often anymore. In fact, the best week of my life was probably when I was at a week long stayaway camp where I didn’t have to see her (ironically on the campus of the university I didn’t apply to). 

And even though I have a pretty good scholarship to my tiny little college I’m in love with, she’s still talking about how much I should stay at home, to save money while I get my degree, and how taxing it’ll be for me to travel home for holidays and summers.

The kickers here are that:
1) My parents aren’t paying a single dime
for my college tuition, it’s all gonna be on me
2) My mom constantly belittles me for even wanting to go to college. I want to study Psychology and eventually get a PhD, but she’s always making underhanded (or usually, loudly on the phone with her friends) comments about how I “won’t make it in college” and how I “should look into being a plumber, they make bank annually” (no hate on plumbers, their jobs are important af, but that’s not my path)

So, Reddit, AITA for not wanting to stay with my mom anymore and for running to an out of state college ASAP?

Now complete the following example-
input: Basically what happened was my boyfriend and I had plans for a movie date and just relaxing at 6pm. He said before that that he was gonna go to the store with his roommate and might be a little late (like half an hour). Well it turns out, they didn’t go to the store until 15 minutes until we were supposed to hangout. I wasn’t angry or anything, I knew he would be a little late. 
He messaged me from his roommates phone saying he left his at home and would message me ASAP when he got home. I said that was great and to just let me know so I could head over (I am about 20 mins from his house). 
An hour passes and I’ve heard absolutely nothing. An hour and a half in I message just to make sure they’re okay. Then two hours. Finally he messages me and says they got distracted. He has a watch and knew the time and sees no issue in the fact that he was two hours late. 
I should mention that I had work at 6AM the next morning so I wasn’t going to be able to stay extra late and was hoping to spend all the time possible. We were only seeing each other 1-2x a week. 
Whenever I expressed that I was upset he made it seem like I was being unreasonable. Mind you, I didn’t lash out or act angry, I just said that I was upset and was wanting to spend time with him because I missed him. And by the time I got over there (like 8:40) I only had like 3 hours to spend with him. 
tl;dr- plans for 6, boyfriend was late and I didn’t end up getting there until almost 9 

AITA for being upset that I waited for two hours and then got told I was overreacting because I was upset?

input: So this girl and I are ""FWB"" according to her but really it's just a casual open relationship. We snuggle, hold hands, talk about deep stuff, and have fun hanging out outside of sex. We act like a couple, not two friends who also sleep together.

We go out about once a week because she says she doesn't have enough time. She has a part time job and goes to highschool. I understand. But she also had a long term boyfriend under those exact same conditions. But she swears we aren't in a ""real"" relationship because she doesn't have the time.

Is she screwing someone else? Is she just using me to get through a dry spell between relationships? Does she not like me enough to go out more often? Or am I just being an insecure asshole who selfishly wants to spend more time with a great girl?

She's also stated she's bad at reading her own emotions, she's going to therapy for it. Maybe that has something to do with it?

Now complete the following example-
input: No matter what, this situation is going to get messy. TLDR at the bottom. 

For context, my (23F) cousin (25f) has a lot of issues. She has always been a pathological liar, has trouble making decisions and being responsible, etc.

About a year ago, my cousin was sleeping with multiple people. I have absolutely no issue with that, she was not in any official relationships. She ended up becoming more serious with one of the dudes, and became monogamous. 

Shortly after, it was revealed that she was pregnant. Her boyfriend wanted to take responsibility, and asked her to move in and marry him. They ended up getting married near the end of her pregnancy. 

Here’s the tricky part. We discussed it near the middle of her pregnancy, and she told me that she had narrowed it down to 2 potential baby daddies - one of them (husband) is white, the other is Asian. She is also white. She also told me (keep in mind - pathological liar) that both guys were informed and amicable, and the hospital had done a ‘blood typing’ test but it was inconclusive because both guys have the same blood type. Firstly.. not sure that’s a thing? And secondly, they would not casually do a paternity test on a fetus, it is very dangerous. 

My brand new nephew is less than a month old. When he was born, it seemed very unlikely that he was white. To be fair, all babies look like little aliens, and often skin tone changes drastically. However, we have had Japanese, Korean, and Chinese people note that he looks specifically Chinese (which is where potential baby daddy’s family is from) - I feel like folks with Asian backgrounds would be able to tell better than my white family. 

My cousin’s sister, who I am very close with, and I have been very torn. We both want what’s best, and do not want to cause a divorce/etc for my cousin. However, we feel it is her husband’s right to know, as he will figure it out eventually, and it is the birth father’s right to know that he has a baby out there.
I don’t want to betray my cousin’s trust, but at the same time I would not technically be at fault because she has explicitly told us, multiple times, that everyone is aware and amicable. I want to be proactive as I feel like the situation will get worse, the longer that time goes on and it becomes more obvious that the child is not white. I feel the bio dad is missing out on an important time in the baby’s life. If it makes a difference, I am quite confident my cousin will reach out to him for child support, if her husband leaves her. 

WIBTA for casually mentioning the situation in front of the husband, perhaps by noting it is admirable he has stuck around? And WIBTA for anonymously contacting the baby daddy and letting him know about the situation? 

TLDR: White cousin has just birthed Asian baby. Husband is white. Should I tell husband and baby daddy what’s going on?

input: A throw away cause of course, but AITA for hating the hotel room we are staying at (and currently in) for the last night of our 10th anniversary trip even though I said don't cheap out?

So it's the last night and the plan was to stay close to the airport so it's easy to hit our morning flight.  But this place sucks... Just to start the bathroom has impressions of pipes (of the glass smoking variety) melted into the top of toilet seat.  And everything, I mean everything, is rusting in there. Even down to the electrical sockets leaking blue rust because I assume someone smoked a ton of meth in there.  You can't set anything on the counter cause someone leaned on it and it tilts so forward everything falls off.  Also the glass from the bathroom window pulled away from the frame and I had to kill a bunch of bugs in the bathtub before giving our kids a bath.

When I mentioned to my wife I didn't like the hotel she picked out she freaked out and got mad.  Said ""We are not rich and can't afford to stay in the Best Western Plus down the road!"".  I'm a software developer and we can afford the $200 a night stay.

TL,DR; wife got pissed cause I didn't like the hotel she picked for our 10th anniversary trip.

Now complete the following example-
input: Me and my girlfriend have been in a relationship for almost two years. She went to study in a different country and we only see each other a couple times in a year. A few days ago she didn't answer my messages until late in the night when she told me she would go to sleep. The next day I found out she went to the club instead and lost all her memories about it. When I ask her why she lied to me she tells me it was because of the alcohol, but I don't think alcohol can make you do that without a real reason behind it. She knows nothing about what she did, but somehow she does know that she didn't do anything wrong or cheat on me. I'm sceptical about this, because how can you be sure if you literally know nothing about your whole night. 

She has always been a very loyal and trustworthy person and had no reason to lie about this, since I have been trying to motivate her to go more outside and do stuff with friends. I'm not mad at her for having fun and I want to trust her really bad, but first lying and afterwards somehow coveniently losing all memories about it just seems a bit too suspicious. I've brought this up multiple times with my girlfriend, but she gets mad at me instead for not trusting her and she suggested taking a break in our relationship. 

So AITA for not trusting my girlfriend?

Now complete the following example-
input: Alright, the title looks like I’m innocent, and no.
The day when XXXTentacion died, there was a period of time when I thought it was fake news. It was very early in the day and some places were saying it was false and I just figured he got shot but he was okay. 
He wasn’t, no disrespect. 
He had been a meme within me and my friend after we listened to one of his songs a while back. From what she said about him to me, it looked like she didn’t care about him as well. Now, we also make jokes about dead/recently deceased people. Not classy, I know, but we don’t do it to be mean. 
My uncle passed away from cancer early 2018. His death was a shock to the family as he’d only been in the hospital for about two weeks before he died and no one told us exactly what it was. My dad was extremely distraught, as that was his only brother. He takes out his emotions on me and my mom (nothing physical, just anger over small things and extreme judgment). So, for me and my mom, grieving for my uncle was only made worse by my dad’s mood swings, which I tried to take for my mom. 
My depression had taken a toll again and overall life was very hard. 
My friend knew this, as she was closest to me. 
So, back to the day XXXTentacion died. During that period of time when I was pretty sure he was okay, my friend posted a Snapchat story that had a screenshot of this news article about him getting shot. I saw this while getting on my phone to avoid crying as my family and I were talking about my uncle. I slid up on my friend’s story saying: “yikes XXXTentadead.” It wasn’t even funny, but I thought she thought it was a meme. 
She responded with: “That’s fucked up man, it’s like me making fun of your fucking dead uncle. Not funny.” 
I was a bit taken aback, and just responded saying that it was my bad. But I didn’t see how an artist she didn’t know getting shot was like my uncle dying. It was much more personal for me and all that. She mocked my joke saying my uncle’s name with ‘dead’ mixed in somewhere. I just said okay and haven’t talked to her. 
I realize I shouldn’t have said the joke, but I also thought she would be okay with it, as we’d made jokes about dead people and rappers before. I know it’s not good to do so, and so fully admit that I really shouldn’t have said anything. 
I also don’t think she should have brought up my uncle knowing that my family still wasn’t okay. 
Am I the asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: The incident happened Friday night, but I'm going to pre face this by telling how I ended up at this jam session. I dont post much on reddit, so I will try to format for easy reading.

A couple months back I was letting my son play at a church playground. When we pulled in I noticed a older gentleman sitting on the bench, but I thought nothing of it since service didnt start for a couple more hours.

This man and I had been talking for awhile and we get on the subject of playing guitar. I tell him that I'm self taught and would like to find a group to listen to / follow along with to learn. He tells me about a little get together they have on friday nights at a church, encourages me to come check it out and to bring along my family.

Fast forward to this Friday and I'm hyped about it. I walk in with my wife and child and I start to feel like maybe we are a little out of place. There was about 10 -15 people there with instruments and around 30 more people in the crowd. All of the guitars looked almost identical, with blonde tybe bodies and here I am with a midnight edition esteban I had gotten from my mamaw when my papaw .

I sat down on the seats lining the wall near a couple other pickers and they introduced themselves. I explained how I don't feel I'm a very strong guitar player and that I was just there to try and follow along. That's when they asked a question I hadn't prepared for,  ""Well, Do you sing? ""

I laughed it off and began to loosen up and the man asked again overvthe mic after he led a song. He said, "" Your a new picker in here with us, I'd really like for you to sing us a song and Jeff and I will play with you! "" I stood up and asked if they knew the song Wagon Wheel from Old Crow Medicine Show and they began to smile and gesture me towards them. 

Now Reddit, I only sing when I play because none of my friends I usually play with will. I definitely had never sung at a function like this but I was feeling great because I have practiced this song alot.

I'm up there and i start singing a little out of time but by the end of the first verse  me and these two fellas are getting it together. I'm staring kind of cross eyed at the mic to keep from looking at the crowd but I can see a few in the front swaying back and forth and I can hear them clapping. We finish the song and when I sat back down the man I was sitting beside told me thats something I should do more often.

I was feeling great about myself and my guitar playing until we left, and this isvthe part that makes me feel like an asshole, my wife mentions that when I got done an older woman made the comment that was NOT the type of place for that song and a man beside of her asked her what was so bad about it .

Am I the asshole ?  My son is wanting to go again next week but I'm really having second thoughts about it. I'm sorry this is a long post . ask questions if you want, ill answer!

Now here’s the thing: My 50 year old mother and literally my entire family are trying to guilt me out of joining. I live with my mom in the US, while the rest of the family is scattered around Canada and Asia. Mom and Dad divorced a decade ago, and I have no siblings so its just been me and her. After I told my mom that I’m joining the Army she went crazy and begged me not to. “WHAT?!?! How could you do this to me? You’re just going to leave me here all alone? Who is going to keep me company and take care of me as I grow old?” 

She expects me to live at home with her and take care of her forever. I told her that I’m an adult and I am under no obligation to do that. I need to live my own life. She responded by telling me that I’m a horrible son that is ungrateful for the life she’s given me, while sobbing uncontrollably. What makes things even worse is that the rest of my family are on her side. 

“Your mom is going to be so lonely! Don’t you love her??” 

“She has no husband or any other kids, its your job to make sure she is okay.” 

“You’re a monster. She’ll most likely kill herself due to the loneliness, and it’ll be on you. All because you wanted to play soldier.” 

All of this has been keeping me up at night, and I’m even starting to second guess my decision. I don’t want my mom to kill herself, but I can’t just have my entire life revolve around her and what SHE wants. AITA?

input: Okay, so I (22M) picked up a microwave from some of my parents  acquaintances for my new place, her daughter (20F) answered the door and got her mom to sell me the microwave. Couple of days later I heard from my dad that the daughter fancies me and that I should get her number. So I'm like sure, I wasn't initially attracted to her but never know if something can still blossom right? I get her number and set up a date, we head out for a few drinks and the conversation was alright and the vibe was good. I pay and drop her off at her parents place and we kiss in the car, we decide right then and there to meet up for saturday evening. Fast forward to tonight; agreed to meet up at my place to cook together and watch a movie. Conversation a bit dry tonight and I realise that I'm just not that attracted to her physically.. We're sitting on the couch and she goes in for the kiss again, it gets a little hot and heavy and I make it clear I'm looking to score. This is where she tells me that she's a virgin and she wants to wait with having sex till being at the right point in a relationship. I am taken a little back by this as she had relationships in the past but she mentions they werent serious. I tell her I respect her choice and ask a little bit about what she's expecting her first time to be like etc.. after an hour or so I tell her I'm tired and if it's okay if I drop her off home. She kisses me again in the car before she gets out.

After writing it down like this it kind of feels like I'm the asshole. I don't want to hurt her but I don't want to have a relationship with her either - It feels like i've already led her on by returning the kisses. 

I guess I should just tell her honestly that I don't fancy her after all?

What's the verdict here?

Now complete the following example-
input: This happened a while ago but I’ve always been curious.

Backstory: I’m female and bisexual and my friend “Jen” is female and pansexual. I went to college far from home and met Jen and we instantly clicked. She was actually near where I’m from so I found comfort in her. It wasn’t until college and until I hung out with Jen more and more that I realized that I was bisexual. I developed a crush on her and although I never explicitly told her, she knew. We cuddled a lot and some people even mistook us as a couple sometimes but we never even kissed or anything. I think we both knew it was a bad idea to possibly jeopardize our friendship by getting together. Either way, I lost feelings for her toward the end when we had a falling out and I realized that I liked the idea of her but  I didn’t like HER (if that makes sense). We made up eventually and planned to move into an apartment together and were gonna share a room for our sophomore year of college. We also planned to share my queen size bed together since it was too much of a hassle for her to buy her own when she didn’t have a car and my car wouldn’t fit a mattress or bed frame (my parents drove up the queen size bed for me).

Anyway I start dating a girl, “Ann,” over the summer and things are great and steady. I had told Ann everything about Jen after some time and although she was surprised at first (she had heard of Jen as my best friend but not as my past crush), she didn’t seem to make a big deal of it. After about three months, I had to go back to school (which would make us long distance). I told Ann that Jen and I were going share a bed throughout the year and she didn’t say much about it. She seemed to understand my reasoning about why, so we never discussed it further.

I ended up casually telling one of my friends about my living situation (sharing a bed) and he was surprised and said it was weird. He told me to change the genders of the situation, “Imagine if you were a guy and sharing a bed with a previous crush—isn’t that messed up for your gf?” But Ann never said anything about it and she actually met Jen and they got along (at some point the three of us ended up sharing the bed because Ann slept over a few times), so I don’t think it’s a big deal. AITA?

TL;DR at bottom

Hey all.  This has been going on for the past few weeks and I’m feeling really shaken and guilty.  Sorry for the bad grammar and stuff.  

So my previous good friend of many years is Tina (not her actual name).  We were reasonably different, but complimented each other.  She’s had some serious family troubles that I’ve helped her with.  We’ve never been in the same social circles, but still made time for each other.

Fast forward to the last two years and in comes John.  From the first time I meet him, I sensed some kinda bad vibes, but I ignored it (stupid me) and was happy that she was in a relationship with someone she loved.  I tried to joke around with John, but he just kinda stared at me so I stopped. We still occasionally hung out and chatted online, but I understood that she needed to cut a bit of our time to develop her relationship.

I don’t know when it started, but Tina started to become a bit more distant.  She’d sometimes leave me on read, or say that she can’t make meetups and always make some vague excuse.  At first I let it slide, but when it started getting worse, I asked her what’s up and why are you becoming more distant.  She just said “sorry, work’s getting real busy” or something along the lines of that, which I thought “that’s fair”. 

One thing I still remember today is when I meet her boyfriend by chance at a supermarket.  I was shopping in an aisle which he happened to also be in.  I smiled and said “hey”.  He just scowled at me, with this look of disgust then walked away.  Even now I wish that I had gone up to him and asked, “what was that for, bitch?” But at the time, I just stood there.

I guess I figured out what the scowl was for when one of Tina’s friends asked me “hey, do you know that Tina has been talking shit about you?”  This shocked me.  She said “yeah, her and her boyfriend have been calling you slut and stuff. I’m all for gossip and stuff, but it was just really toxic.” I was extremely  upset.  I used to use have sex and  do drugs throughout middle school and high school because I was dealing with some really bad shit and Tina knew that.  People have called me slut behind my back, but to know that Tina was the one that said it hurt me so much. 

I consulted with another one of my friends and she agreed to come with me and confront Tina about it.  I asked her if we could meet up and surprisingly she agreed.   So we meet up, sat down and did a bit of small talk.  Then I asked “is it true that you’ve been calling me a slut behind my back?”  I’ve always been direct. She seemed shocked and quickly denied it.  I said that her friend told me that and she immediately  asked “which one?” It didn’t matter and I told her that.  She seemed really uncomfortable so my friend stepped in and asked the questions again, but a bit softer.  Tina’s always been a bad liar so her face said it all. 

I wasn’t really too angry, just mostly sad.  Actually scratch that, deep down I was pissed.  I asked her why did you do that.  She didn’t really say anything.  When I asked if her boyfriend made her say it she said no. I remember her shoulders were super hunched over and she was shaking a bit.  I admit that this should have been a warning sign to stop but I was to upset to consider that. I asked her what’s going on and she said nothing.  I replied something along the lines of “you, knowing my history, called me  a slut.  That’s not nothing.”  

She then told me “well you kinda were.” My friend told me that, when Tina said that, my face looked so angry, especially after she continued “I told John about it and he agreed.” 

I exploded.  I’ve been known to have somewhat of a nasty temper (I’ve been going to therapy to help reduce that), so the next five minutes were us screaming at each other, with most of what I said summarising into “what the fuck is wrong with you.”  At one point, Tina accused me of being a Lesbian that was obsessed with her. My friend tried to calm us down, but that didn’t work so she half dragged me out of the building and into her car.  I don’t remember most of this, most of it is my friend telling me what happened.  I do remember breaking down in the car though.

A year and a bit past since then.  Tina blocked me on all social media.  Her friend told me that John and Tina still talked shit about me until that friend stopped hanging out with her.  Due to our social groups not overlapping there wasn’t any friend drama, but I still felt empty.  When I thought of Tina, I choked up on fury and sadness.

I got a text from Tina a couple of weeks ago asking if we could meet up.  When I asked her “why?, she said “to apologise” 

So I meet up with her and she explained that her boyfriend was verbally and emotionally abusive, bordering on Narcissism.  She said that he was so nice at first and then turned toxic.  That he talked shit about most of her friends (especially me for some reason) and eventually she kinda believed that.  It took a lot of self-reflection and help from others to realise what was going on.  Even then he tried to keep them together.  

She told me this and apologised and I just remember sitting there, saying nothing.  I couldn’t bring myself to forgive her.  I’ve always been one to hold a grudge, so many be that’s why.  I understand that maybe I should have tried to reach her, but part of my was furious that she told someone I didn’t know that well personal stuff like that.  I might be overreacting.  It’s just I feel so guilty because she went through hell and I’m basically telling her to piss off. It’s just I don’t trust her enough now for this not to happen again.   I feel so bad and don’t really know if I’m being dick.

TL;DR:  Good friend of mine dated a narcissist, became really toxic and called me slut behind me back.  When I confronted her we had a screaming match and didn’t talk for a year and a half. She apologised but I can’t forgive her.

input: Written on mobile so sorry for any formatting errors. 

Okay so here at University me and my mate are in the habit of going to the gym every morning at 6:30am before our 9:00am lectures. Last night he decided to go on a night out but still wanted to make sure he went to the gym this morning. So in the evening before he went  he came and gave me £20 and stated that if he did not meet me in the morning to go to the gym I can keep the money- being a broke student I happily agreed.

Fast forward to this morning and he never met me and I could see his light was off through his window. I messaged him and got no reply so continued to go to the gym alone. Once i got back to our accommodation he was up and explained that he set his alarm but somehow slept through it and never consciously chose not to go to the gym.

I felt bad after hearing this but said I would stick to the deal and keep the money so he makes sure he comes next time. After this I decided to buy him a drink and he thanked me. However some of my other friends are saying that me keeping the money is not me being a good friend by sticking to the deal and that I should pay him back all of it (£20 may not sound like a lot but as I said, for me as a student it is nearly a weeks worth of money).

AITA for not giving him the money back?

They always complain about how ugly and fat they are and then go on about how no one cares about them yet they're the ones thinking so when people actually do care about them and go through hell and back just to make them happy. I don't want to be their friend anymore because of this because it feels like a toxic, awkward situation to be in that I don't want to be apart of, despite this person being my only friend at this school besides another person.

Now complete the following example-
input: This is a couple days old but I’ve been feeling conflicted about it since it happened. So a couple days ago as I was leaving one of my classes I say bye to my friend, and another friend we’ll call G says “wow, you aren’t going to say bye to me? Ouch.” She didn’t mean it in a mean way, but it’s pretty annoying, and this happens to me a lot. I turned around and awkwardly said, “oh, uhh bye?” It was painfully awkward. When I get home I put on my story a PSA saying “hey can you not do this” because oddly enough this happens to me at least twice a week from different people. Well, G got angry. Very angry. She texted me saying I don’t know how to take a joke and how I shouldn’t call her out on my story. At first I tried defusing the situation saying that I didn’t say it towards her specifically, but she was still pissed. That was enough for me and I ended up succumbing and got in a fight with her. For context, she has a really bad habit of constantly mocking my sense of humor and taste in music, saying that both are terrible any time I show anyone in her vicinity a meme or song, as well as just usually calling me stupid. She does this all under the guise of “sarcasm” and “joking”, and I ended up unloading all of my pent up anger about it on her. I really really *really* laid into her. At the end of my tirade I said verbatim “if you haven’t noticed, these past few days I’ve been purposely avoiding you, and I’d appreciate it if you did the same.” All she texted back was “thanks for making me cry, dickhead.” I left it at that. I came to mutual friends to try and get advice on the situation, and they all told me I was in the wrong for yelling at her and for putting the PSA on my snap. They all told me I had to apologize. I eventually relented because I realized I’d destroy my friendships with all of them if I didn’t, and so the next time I saw G I stumbled through an apology I didn’t mean, feeling totally humiliated. She thanked me and things have gone back to normal since, but when I mean normal I’m saying the continual bullying. Every once in a while she’ll give subtle hints to the things I said to her, throwing them back in my face, but never outright saying it. Am I the asshole? I feel like at any time I could’ve just apologized and ended it before it spiraled out of control, and I guess in retrospect the PSA was kind of passive aggressive, but I still feel like G’s response was out of proportion to the situation at hand.

input: So I’m on the train. Normal morning commute to work. Luckily it’s not as crowded as normal so I get a seat and an empty seat next to me. At the next stop a woman gets on and sits next to me. It seemed to me like she was struggling to sit in a comfortable way and she her stomach was very round and protruding out of her dress. (It was some kind of form-hugging sweater dress so it was fairly noticeable). 

I also should point out that I am 7 months pregnant myself! I thought we had something in common so I smiled at her and said “when are you due?” She then furrows her eyebrows at me and goes “Pardon me?” 

That’s when I thought maybe she took offense because she doesn’t know me so I was like “oh sorry it’s none of my business.” 

That’s when she narrowed her eyes and said in a snappy way “I’m not pregnant.” Obviously I’m mortified but I kind of froze up and didn’t know what to say so I think I just said “oh”. 

She then gets up and walks to the whole other side of the train even though that meant she had to stand until we got to her stop. So clearly my comment really bothered her :/

I am obviously embarrassed now by the whole thing. But I truly didn’t have any ill intent. 

(I actually texted my husband about this whole situation when I got to work. But his reaction to stuff like this is generally just to make jokes to make me feel better which isn’t always super helpful...)

Now complete the following example-
input: **Backstory:**

I startet and finished a apprenticeship as a system engineer, did my mandatory military service an then worked until 2017. In 2017 I quit my job and did a one year fulltime school (Maturitiy / Maturité) that I can start studying.  During this time I started working as a freelancer for a former co-worker that started his own business. When I was finished with school I startet studying fulltime and also worked 40% part-time for him.  In this winter I decided I miss my freetime and changed to part-time studying. I currently work 60%.

Important during all this time I am employed as a freelancer with a notice period of two months. (two months are mandatory in my country) If there is no work he's not obligated to pay me anything, I work per hour. I never worried about that since I always had enough work.

&amp;#x200B;

**Today:**

Through a coleague from University I got a really good job offer. Better pay, paid trainings for tens of thousands of dollars and it is a dream job from the tasks. It sounds really great. I really want that job, but also don't want to destroy my bosses business.

I just landed and startet a Project worth 80 grand. That the company only got because of me. I told him if I took the offer I would finish the project and create a perfect documentation that when I'm gone someone can take over. I always put the company first I worked on weekends, evenings no matter what. The main thing was that the customer was happy. I will also miss one week of lectures, because I will work one week on the project on the other side of the planet, with jetlag and everything.

In the ""talk"" about my idea to leave he got really mad and came on a personal level and gave me a guilty conscience. My boss told me he thought I would help him build up his company, to what I never accepted or signed anything. I mean I love what I do and do a goddamn good job. But I always saw me as a salaried. I don't own any parts of the company. Even in this big project he presented himself as the main character to the customer. As if he did all the planning, preparation and hard work. All my other Projects are really good documented with a couple of weeks someone can take my job over. I even asked the new possible employer if he could wait until august that I can learn in a new person for my job. Further he told me it's unfair that I leave and let him hanging. I give him goddamn 5 months to find someone. 

My boss and I always had a really good time during work. I would even call him a good work friend.

He told me I could leave but he would never forgive me for the betrayal.

&amp;#x200B;

I talked with my two best friends about that. Both told me that I'm not an asshole for wanting to take the opportunity and should leave if I wanted to. 

Are they right? What do you think?

Now complete the following example-
input: Before we got married (4.5 years ago) we agreed to take care of each other’s parents when the time came. Unfortunately we did not discuss grandparents and great-grandparents, and that is what we are running into. 

We had our first kid almost a year ago, and I’ve struggled with some PPD. My husband works full time in a high stress job, and I work part time at an hourly job. 

My MIL watches our son two days a week for five-six hours a day. She does it for free. When she’s not watching our son, she’s taking care of her grandma (93) or helping FIL with his farm (they’re divorced but back together). She does have other seasonal work, though that is done for now. FIL has helped with some projects around the house and has even paid for some smaller projects completely (usually as a Christmas or anniversary gift). Both of FIL’s parents are alive (83 and 85) and are starting to have some problems. 

ALL of these people love my husband, are (mostly) kind to me, and absolutely adore my son. They do not want bad things for any of us, but none of them have boundaries with each other so that is what they expect of us. I also do not want to cut off ties with any of them- I just want healthy boundaries and some breathing room. 

Because of all the things they have done/do, my MIL and FIL expect and now somewhat rely on my husband to help with their respective parents/grandparent on a regular (though random) basis. This has greatly effected mine and husband’s relationship, which is already going through normal new parent ups and downs. 

If we didn’t have our son, I wouldn’t care as much, but now it’s taken my husband away from us on his days off, eaten up his time in the evening, and even used up some of my husband’s limited sick/vacation days- that I feel should be saved for sick baby days or other things like that. Also, my husband’s physical health has been negatively effected by this. 

If it was once a week or a couple times a month that we could plan around/prepare for, I’d be much less upset about it but his parents are so last minute and don’t communicate well so this is really not an option unless my husband really sticks to his guns about boundaries. To be fair, husband has gotten better from when we first got married, but since we’ve had our son and his grandparents health issues have increased, it’s gotten out of control again (or at least that’s how I feel)

Two weeks ago, we made a rule together that we will not answer calls/texts from 5:00PM-7:00PM because that’s “family time”. Husband gets home around 4:30 and baby goes to bed around 7:00, and we go to bed around 10:00, so there are plenty of other times to talk to whomever. 

About every other evening, a family member of his has called in this two-hour time period, and EVERY SINGLE TIME husband asks me if he can answer it. I HATE that I have to tell him no- so I don’t, but I do get mad about it and tell him that it hurts me that he can’t just be “ours” for two hours a day, and that I have to be the bad guy even though we both agreed to this. 

So not only are our evenings CONSTANTLY interrupted, all of his free time is being used up by grandparent appointments, or helping his parents with something or other, or being on the phone with one of them OFTEN (more than daily). There is NOT a day that goes by that is not in some way effected by his family. I am overwhelmed. 

This is just the shortened version of it, so there is more at play here but I’m really trying to stick to facts and be fair. 

It’s driving me crazy and really hurting me for me and my son. I just want to move far away from his family at this point. But I don’t want to be the wedge between my husband and his family in an unhealthy way, so If I’m in the wrong and not being sensitive enough or fair enough, please tell me! AITA???

Now complete the following example-
input: I (20/M) am studying abroad in Lodz, Poland, through europe's Erasmus program. My girlfriend (20/F) of 7 months is coming to visit me from our home country for one week in April. 

She wants me to take her to Auschwitz because it is one of her dreams to visit the camp. We both agreed that it is dangerous for her to go alone, both for security reasons and because she doesn't know how to use public transports to get where she needs to be (I am already used to it so I know how to do it). I do not want to go to the concentration camp with her because I have already visited it last weekend in a group trip prepared for some erasmus students and I paid around 100€ for that weekend. It seems unwise for me to go again 1 month later considering that: I will be busy with work assignments; all the costs to get there; the money that I will spend that could be used for me to visit other places like I have already semi planned.



Important things to consider: 

- Right now I have very little money to live off of for the remainder of the semester (around 600€ for 3 and a half months, not considering rent which is 150€/month). I got most of the scholarship's money at the beginning of the semester and I will receive the other part after the semester ends, but that money is already destined for other stuff (I have some physical problems and I will use the money to pay for doctors appointments and whatever is needed to fix me. Also, I need to buy a new laptop because mine is getting pretty old, although still functional).

- I always knew it was her dream to visit the camp and I would like her to fulfil her dream. However, because of money problems from her side, we were never sure if she could actually come visit me, so I never really kept in mind that I needed to save some money to go with her or that I should not have gone on that weekend trip just so that I could go with her later.

- She has the possibility to go with some family members that are also coming for a visit but she doesn't want to go with them. She wants to go with me for 2 reasons: -She doesn't want to spend 1 day of that week far from me because we have already been apart for 3 months. In my opinion this isn't a good reason because 1. I will be going home for one week after she is here and 2. because we will have time in the future to be together but she probably won't have the opportunity to visit Auschwitz in the future. -She wants it to be an experience shared by both of us so that it will be remembered in the future.

So, Reddit, WIBTA here?

Now complete the following example-
input: Well, backstory time. Since christmas is coming soon I wanted to make mother happy and buy her something she always wanted. What she wanted is probably not so important, the important thing is that it is very expensive. In fact its too expensive for me to buy it all myself (Im still a young teen), so I asked my brother if he would want to buy it together and that it would be a gift from the both of us (my brother is an adult, late twenties). I would pay half and he would pay half too, obviously.   
When I first mentioned it he seemed to be happy that he doesnt have to think up anything and agreed. Today I mentioned it again so we can go buy it asap. He got very angry at me and said its too expensive. I will probably sound assholish here, but he has a stable well paying job and lives with grandmother (rent free, doesnt have to buy food), I dont know his financial situation but he always seems to spend money on pointless things like enormous tattoos or new vapes.  I got mad at him for not wanting to spend money on a thing that would make our mom overjoyed. She always buys stuff for him, even if its not a special occassion (like consoles whenever there is a newer model). He started attacking me that I can save up nicely when mom buys things for me, because I got new shoes recently (the old ones fell apart, I didnt have money on them myself so mother helped me buy them) and he also started attacking my mental illness, saying that I dont have to spend anything when I dont go out in the first place.   
The last thing made me teary eyed so I ran into my room. I realize I shouldnt have gotten mad at him in the first place when he said he doesnt have money for it, but it just made me worked up.   
He texted me that he decided to get mom some soap and a candle. That made me even sadder now though.   
So yeah Id appreciate every response, I would be happy to receive advice on if should I apologize to him or not.

input: So I'll get to it. Me (19f) have had a best friend (19m) for more than 2 years now. We've been through shit and though amazing times. Lately we went through a tough period and we're not really just as close. There are some things left unsaid and seems like no one wanted to say them.

For context, he;s been smoking weed for about a year and a half or more and has these 3 friends he does it with, which in my opinion are toxit (barely graduted, spending their parents' money and doing/dealing weed etc). He knows I don't like them, but I've never been to vocal about it.

So today I caught him in a small lie and got all annoyed and I snaped. So I told him everything I had on my soul, and poured my soul. He's been smoking HUGE amounts lately, like huge, more than he has ever before and hangs out with these friends all the time just to smoke and drive around the town. I know those friends are into stronger stuff and I'm really scared he might end up doing other things as well. So I told him that I care, that he is not heading in the right direction imo and he should really be more careful as those guys are just there for him when it comes to smoking, not real friends like me and him have been. Told him I can't stand to watch it. He replied ""stop texting me SHIT LIKE THIS"". 

I can't tie myself to someone doing things like this, I was more open than ever, but I've just started therapy after almost killing myself and I can't have toxit people and drugs in my life. Told him that, from my point of view, unless he decides to contact me and talk about it, our friendship is over.

input: 
(First of all forgive me for my bad grammar, English is not my first language)
things started a few months ago, my boyfriend's ex-girlfriend sent me a message to tell me that my boyfriend had been unfaithful to me, that they had kissed and she felt very bad about it, at first I hesitate but knowing that he had cheated on me once, it is when I take it seriously (He told me what he did immediately, we cut for a while but a few months later we went out again), then she told me that he told her the things we did in bed, things that I liked that they were impossible to know unless one of us told them; to add to all this a few days later a friend we have in common with his ex showed me some screenshots of conversations he had with some of my boyfriend's ex friends; generally they all said that he was not a very good person, that he had cheated on me several times, that he had never valued me and that he was not reliable. That's why I decided to confront him, at first he did not give much importance but when I notice that I was very upset about this he finally told me that none of that had happened and that it was just people with nothing better to do, looking to interfere in our relationship. We discussed a lot about this and although now we are better I don't know if I just let it go, I understand that someone may want to generate drama but there are so many people telling the same story.
To add, I know how he behaved in his previous relationships, he did some questionable things but we must consider that he was very immature since I have known him since we have 13.

AITA for not knowing if it is the best thing for me to trust him? I have to believe more in him? Or I have to bring up the subject again?

I tried telling her how that can affect our future and she rolled her eyes and went back on Instagram. 
from what I gathered she skipped English class and math class. 
I took issue to that, and thought I would tell my parents, the reaction shocked me.

And lastly there's Brad. He's Jess' boyfriend, they're together for 5 years.

Brad and Jess had some rough patches a few months ago and got separated for a few weeks. During this time Brad met Cindy. They started going out and Cindy was head over heels for him. They were seeing each other for about three months when I met Jess in a group setting. She casually mentioned that she and Brad were back together. The thing is I knew that next Saturday Cindy had planned a date with Brad. So I told Cindy. She was so heartbroken but she's my friend and I couldn't have watched her dating that lying idiot (he told her he had broken up with Jess for good). Now the thing is, I haven't told Jess that Brad and Cindy were dating while she and Brad were already back together. I'm pretty sure she doesn't know about it. I feel like as an outside person it isn't any of my business. Jess is a friend but not that close and I don't want to be caught in the middle of something. But a friend of mine said that I'm an asshole for telling Cindy about Brad's capers but not Jess. AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: Am I the asshole for not wanting to move out with a friend?

I’m a male 24 year old, she is 22. Her and I are extremely close with each other, where we would have some boundary issues and really only have one another to chat and hang out with. She really doesn’t have any friends, and mentions that I’m her closest friend she’s ever had. I’ve had friends in the past, but they come and go, as is life. We’ve also bonded over our mental struggles and upbringings, video games, music, food, she was my best friend, and I started to feel more. 

With her, I’ve developed strong feelings for her the first 3 months of hanging out whenever we met. It was unrequited love. She didn’t feel the same way. I was heartbroken, yadayada, but a part of me feels like if we were to live with each other, that boundary I try not to cross would be extremely crossed. 

A part of me still feels that way, still daydreams that way, wishes it could be that way. I hate it, it’s disgusting and selfish and so egotistical of me. We’ve had arguments and countless fights in the past about the topic, and other things, where we’ve stopped being friends for 2 months or so. 

I found out my current roommates aren’t resigning our lease, and I move out end of April. I texted her saying that “none of my roommates are resigning lol”(she knows there’s been drama, BS, etc), and she immediately jumped to her moving out with me and my brother. And expected an answer right then and there through text. I told her we should talk about it in person. We did, I told her about the countless fights, the boundaries, my feelings that are still there somewhere or might resurface. So I said I’d have to think about it. She ALREADY resigned her lease, and called to cancel it. 

She cancelled her lease. 

It took me over 2 weeks to think about it my decision, and I leaned more towards no and found it hard to say yes. So I told her no over the phone, and she blew up, saying I’m selfish, all I care about is myself, I’m playing the victim “so hard”. If I lived with this girl, it would be unhealthy, as much as I love and value our friendships, I can’t do that to myself. Reddit, Am I the asshole???

input: To preface this - I don't really know anything about weddings. This is the first bridal shower I've ever gone to and I actually had to google what a bridal shower even is (and I'm still not really sure?)

Anyways. My bf's sister is getting married and her bridal shower is next month. Over Christmas this last year I made sugar cookies with royal icing and shared with bf's family. They enjoyed it so his other sister (not the one getting married, she's the MOH and setting up the bridal shower) asked me if I could make some sugar cookies for the bridal shower. I agreed. Now I am no professional baker/cookie decorator. The cookies I made at Christmas was actually the first time I've ever decorated cookies, so I am still pretty slow and clumsy at all of it. I estimate that the 30 cookies she asked me to make will take maybe like 6 hours total to bake and decorate?  

So my question is, WIBTA if I treated these sugar cookies as my present to the bride instead of purchasing a present off the registry? Or should I still plan on bringing a present since it wasn't the bride that asked me to bake these?

Now complete the following example-
input: Listen, I enjoy the simple things in life. One of those things being ambiance. I love me the soft glow and flicker of a candle and its gentle wafting scent. But I digress. 

About a week or two ago, my German shepherd chewed through a few hundred dollars worth of blinds in my mom's brand new home. I completely understood her frustration, and offered to pay for the blinds, but she declined. Since then, however, she's been unrealistically paranoid about mishaps occurring in her home. One of those things being a candle. I asked her if I could get a candle for my room (as I still live with her while going to school), and she said no, because she didn't want me to burn the house down. You know, maybe if I were 10-years-old, I'd agree. At the tender age of nineteen, though, I think I can handle a small Glade candle. She claimed I am easily distracted, which offended me firstly because of the lack of trust, and secondly because she couldn't offer an instance where I've demonstrated an irresponsibility equivalent to forgetting to burn out a candle. Her concerns stem from the three animals we have, namely the cat. My cat is constantly knocking things over, as many cats do. I am aware that this is, of course, not great for having a candle, but I also have a rather tall dresser that she's not yet jumped on or knocked anything off of. I stated that I could either keep the door closed while I had the candle burning or just keep a watchful eye that my cat doesn't jump on the dresser, where I'd keep the candle. Any solution I offered was shut down with, ""accidents happen. That's why they're called accidents."" Either way, it's not like I'd have a candle going in my room without me in it. But okay!

Anyway, I get that it's her house, so it's her rules. She does a lot for me, and I'm super appreciative. At the same time, I think it's a little excessive to not let me use one small candle in my room. I realize a candle is actually a risk, but lots of things can be slightly risky. And yes, you should try to minimize risk, but to what degree is it too much?  I also get that it's not worth being mad about; most people would just say, ""dude, it's just a candle. You can live without burning a candle."" But sometimes it's nice to come home after a stressful day and light up that delightful smelling ball of wax. I was really looking forward to getting one for my room. Lastly, I want to stress that I'm not, like, super upset at her or anything. More slightly annoyed. I love her so much, and she's an amazing mom, so this isn't something that'd affect the relationship or anything.

TLDR; my mom is paranoid that I'll burn the house down by accidentally forgetting to blow out a candle, so she won't let me have a candle in my room. AITA for being sort of upset that she doesn't trust me and is being a bit paranoid?

Now complete the following example-
input: So this happened a while back but it still nags at me. I had stared a new job i was 16 at the time and it was in a small cafe like shop. It was i think my second time in the closing shift and the way we close down usually breaks down like this. We close doors at 8:00 and do all of the cleaning up (washing dishes, prepping for tomorrow, sweeping floor, wiping tables etc.) Then we take one last look around and lock up and leave, the times that I closed we left usually around 10pm as there are only 2 people shutting down. So i was working at the till and the person i was closing with was working at the food section so we start closing. I count the remaining sweets we have left and take the old products to the back as they will either get thrown out or donated and clean the sweets counter. Then I start counting the money and filling out papers for how much we had in sales and they are about half done with their station. Once i finish i put the cash in a safe in the back and start cleaning up the coffee station. By this time its about 8:30 and they finish their station and start washing dirty dishes. So i get finished cleaning the coffee station at around 9:30 and start cleaning the tables in the front and sweeping and mopping the area. 10:45 hits us and we have to clock out (we get written up if we dont clock out in time) so I finish up the rest of the mopping and its about 11:00 and my parents were texting me because they were picking me up and wondering where i was. As i had cleaned up all of the front and mopped and sweeped everything and my partner was still in the back washing dishes (mind you its been about 2 hours and 30 minutes at this point). So i asked them if i could go because it was getting late and all they had to finish was the dishes. Now we dont have a dinner rush at this cafe, most of the customers come in at middday and the shift before us does dishes then too so there arent a ton of dishes to clean and we had a big dishwasher. So they shouldnt be washing dishes for that long. I ask if i could go because my family was waiting for me and they said ""yeah, have a goodnight see you tomorrow"" so i thought i was in the clear, but i was wrong. The next day they had sent a picture of the dirty dishes to the works group chat at 1AM saying that they couldnt do it all because i had left them. Which looked like the same ammount of dishes that were there when i left. So Am I the Asshole for leaving?

input: So it’s about 1:30 or so on a Saturday night in Philadelphia. We’re all waiting in a long ass line at a cheesesteak place, if you’ve ever hit one after the bars you’ll know the scene I’m trying to describe. 

We’ve been waiting maybe 15 minutes when 4 African American girls squeeze past us and join two friends that were in front of us. If it was one or two I’d have been okay but 4 was a bit much. So I said “Hey, what the fuck go to the back of the line like everyone else!”  One girl starts saying “Why, because I’m black??” And another friend starts recording me saying I’m a racist MF and all this other crap. For reference, I am not black, but their race didn’t matter I would have said this to anyone. 

Employee yells what the fuss is all about and the group starts screaming that I’m being racist. I then get told to leave, which I do. 


I probably should have just let the cutters go since I got told to leave and didn’t get a delicious cheesesteak, and I probably should have asked nicer to get to the back of the line. Am I the racist a hole here?

We've been fighting over this all day and she still FIRMLY denies it, saying she has no idea how it happened and it has nothing to do with her.

Although this may seem like a petty fight, she is threatening to break up with me because she feels it highlights trust issues in our relationship. Am I in the wrong for not believing her? Is it possible its some sort of glitch in the ios text app?

Added info that might be relevant:

\- The message included (in quotations) a quote from a text I had sent the day before, that then included a snarky remark

\- She tried to shift the argument away from the text message and went on to attack me

Now complete the following example-
input: So, my boyfriend (23) and I (20) are both students and have been together for three years. He is in his final year as a informatic engineer and I just started university in toxicology. He currently is doing his last traineeship (or intership? I do not not what it would be called in English) 2 hours from where I live so we only see each other on weekends and during the week we talk on the phone. 
Tbh I’m always down to ear him complain about almost anything because I like talking to him and all but there is this one thing I can’t ear anymore: his salary. 
So when he will be done from school he will make around 70k+ a year which is a lot in my opinion. BUT currently he is making way less, which is normal since he is an intern and only work 4 month a year and the other months he is in school. Way less is still 2x more what I made at my student job when I used to do around the same amount of hours.

A bit a background here: last year I worked almost full time (between 30-35hrs a week has my job would give me) to collect my money so I wouldn’t have to worry about it at school and I still work today with school (less than 15hrs a week). During that year, I agree, I complained A LOT. Like A LOT. At mid point in the year he told me how annoying that was. I got pretty angry and frustrated at first but then I realized, and I worked on it and tried not to complain as much after that. 

Now, back with the story: this morning he called me like usual and we talked a bit before he started complaining about having no money. His pay is next week and we just bought a vacation in the south with two friends and he can’t pay his credit right now because the vacation was more than what currently has in bank BUT his next pay will cover way more than that. So we agreed that I would give him money so he could pay for the credit and he would pay me back next week (okay for me). But he kept saying that he is way underpay and that he should be given more (from the company not me haha). 
I was already kinda annoyed from all the previous time so I didn’t say anything. So he told me &lt;&lt;are you tired about me talking about money&gt;&gt; so I told him yes and then it started.
I told him that I felt he was a bit entitled and that he should stand back a bit. That the condition of his internship were good and that he shouldn’t be that demanding. Then he lashed back and told me about all the time I complained about my job. Then I told him that he’s still very lucky and that not making 95k a year is still really really good for a student…
Then he told me that he had to go and the conversation ended there.
And now I’m conflicted because I hate (like hate with a fury) people that have the mentality of you can’t complain because some people have it worse. And I kinda feel like that right now.
But I also feel like I was right for that specific thing.  

(TLDR: I told my boyfriend that he shouldn’t complain about the money he make as an intern because it is still making way more than minimum wage and now I feel like an asshole)

input: Okay so I’ve been friends with this girl for a little over a year, we’re roommates now and through the months she observed me wearing my reading glasses. Strictly for reading. Somehow she came to the conclusion all on her own that I also wear contacts. She’s mentioned/asked how I take care of my “contacts” and I’ve ignored her. I’ve been struggling if I should correct her and tell her that I’ve never had contacts, I don’t even really need glasses to read either (no offense to those who do where glasses- I only wear reading glasses to make it easier). 

Like I said, I’ve known her for a little over a year so I feel like it would be a little awkward to correct her now. Plus, she may accuse me of lying to her all this time when that’s not true. Should I correct her? Am I the asshole?

input: While snapchatting with a girl during the early evening, she sent me a «coupon for 1 free nude». I jokingly responded that i’d send one later.  While i drank with a couple of my friends, she asked me «where did the nude go?». I kinda laughed the question off, while continuing on with the conversation.
After my friends got home and i was laying in bed, she sent the same «1 free nude cupon» and i thought «fuck it, whatever» and sent her a dick pic, ending the conversation.
The next day, i spoke to her, and she was mad at me, claming «a nude is not a dick pic». 
AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: I’m a 21 year old living with my parents and my two younger brothers (both in elementary school). My schedule consists of working ~8 hour shifts Tuesday, Thursday, and weekends, while having class for 8 hours on MWF. This does not account for time spent on homework. 

I pay my parents $150 in rent every month because they claim to be struggling with bills and I can’t afford my own place only working ~30 hours a week on $11/hour. 

However, they seem to be doing fine, buying new beds and televisions and generally blowing money on unnecessary things. 

Since I pay for my own car insurance, gas, tolls (necessity, unless I want to use double the gas and take 90+ minutes to get to school), and phone bill, I’m stretched thin on money as is. I’m barely able to save for when I’m out of school, let alone spend money on anything during my little free time.

So given the situation, if I asked them to hold off on asking for rent, would I be an entitled asshole? Or would that be reasonable?

Now complete the following example-
input: So long story short.

A dude from my grade decided last year that he wanted to be a rich artist. His qoal from the start was to earn a lot of money, at least that's how he talks about it in interviews.
During this year he has gotten a lot of exposure, he is working together with our parish and earning a respectable amount of money for a high schooler. I believe that recently he even got his own art show at another city and has held multiple ones here where he lives. 

Then I discovered something. All of his art work looks heavily inspired by an artist named Basquiat. So heavily, that when I showed pictures to my friends, they all immediately saw similarities.  (For an example the dude from my school paints the exact same faces and adds words, just like Basquiat does, only my acquaintance doesn't write them out completely. Even the colours are mostly same)
Now the dude is kind of an ass also, he thinks he is better than everyone and pretends to be this serious artist. After he started earning money from his paintings his ego went through the roof and most people would agree. 

So I've been doing silent exposing already, showing Basquiat's works to my friends and making them aware, but I could do more.
Our school has a popular account on Instagram that over half of the students follow and it only posts memes of our school, a way to vent our frustrations. Nobody knows who runs it, but it's secretly me and my friend. 
My friend after hearing about this had an idea to post about it on our page, but I argued against it. Yes, the dude is a douche. Yes, the things he does are wrong. But, I don't want to make him feel like shit. 
It feels to me like it is morally wrong to expose someone like that, especially because the dude himself has a lot of problems with his family and in his personal life.

So, Reddit, would I be the asshole if I exposed him for plagiarizing a famous artist's work?

Now complete the following example-
input: So, some quick background, my husband 3 kids and I moved in with my MIL back in July to help raise our 2 nephews because she works 2nd shift ft and I'm a stay at home mom. There's more details in my post history if anyone cared to dig. 

My MIL is mostly a very nice lady. She can be very passive aggressive though, instead of acting like an adult and saying she'd prefer something else, she pouts or rage cleans. My husband has always been lazy when it comes to helping with kids, he will be staring at his phone while I'm busy as he'll, and when I ask him to jump in a nd help, acts like he's totally put out. 

Last week, we got a call my BIL was found unresponsive. After several days in hospital,  he was declared brain dead. MIL decided to donate his organs, so it took several more days in hospital while they did testing and set up donations. This is also winter break for the kids (5 total). I was happy to jump in (99% of childcare already on me, I am now doing 100%). That's all over now, and his service is Sun. 

Kids have been sick, so has MIL, and now I've got it. I was up all night before last with screaming 3 yo with ear infection,  got no sleep. Now I'm exhausted and sick too. I told husband and MIL if I was taking care of kids last night, bedtime was going to be early, as I'm sick too and exhausted. MIL had been going through pics at table for last few days. Her rule is only food at table. So dinner last night,  I started to throw down a blanket for a picnic dinner. She got bit snappy Says she was cleaning table off. Ok. Tgen bedtime snack, table still mostly clear except for album directly in front of her. I set 3 of kids at table, said be careful with your drinks. If she didn't want them at table, she could have said as much, I'd have moved them elsewhere. Instead she grabbed her things went into bedroom and slammed door then started sobbing loudly. Kids were freaked out by it, so I was then reassuring them that grandma was just sad about thier uncle, it was ok, just brush teeth lay down with thier tablets. Once they were in bed, I went and sat on futon in front room, only other place for me to sleep. I left lights on in case she decided to come back out with pics. She came out in PJs, got drink went back in bedroom. I assumed that meant she was going to bed o r at least her room for night. So I finally turned off light laid down. Few minutes later, I heard 3 yo crying. Husband had laid down with her at 630 fell asleep, left me with other 4 kids. I told husband his mom was upset, ran over what happened. He went off on me, saying I should have asked what she wanted, or should have known. I was a bitch for being mean to his grieving mom. 

I'm truly trying my best to be helpful, but I'm also sick and was already at my breaking point as caretaker. My break got cancelled twice with the goings on due to my BIL dying. I understand that, it sucks for me, but it is what it is. But I think expecting me to read Mil's mind is a bit much. She could have easily said hey, not at table, I'd have changed plans. Instead she threw a fit. 

So, AITA for thinking even if grieving, an adult should be able to express their feelings to me without all the drama? Keep in mind, this is not new to her grieving period, she's done this several times since we have been here.
output: ",not being psychic and knowing what my grieving MIL wants

Now complete the following example-
input: Pretty much as the title says, but obviously there are more details to the story, otherwise I wouldn’t be making this post. 

So, yesterday I went to the movies with a couple of friends to see The Prodigy. We’ve seen many other horror/scary movies in the theater together and there’s always something. For some reason people are much much ruder when seeing horror movies so we/I was already prepared for the worst. 

Anyway, we get settled into our seats as the previews play and a little bit later these two guys come in and sit next to us, leaving a buffer seat (mind you, many many other seats they could have chosen). Almost immediately he takes out his pen and takes a hit and lets out a huge cloud of smoke. I roll my eyes and sigh and then cross my arms. I can see him look over at me and I think maybe he sees how annoyed I am and will refrain for the rest of the movie, I was wrong. 

Like 1 minute after this he takes another hit and I look to my friends, we all roll our eyes and I look back at him while I put my arms up in frustration. He then leaves to go refill his soda and doesn’t return until the movie has already started. 

He waits for about 2 minutes after he’s sat back down before taking another hit and releasing yet another HUGE cloud of smoke. I can’t take anymore and I don’t want yet another scary movie ruined, so I turn to him and say, “dude, seriously? This is not the place!” He looks at me with an expression that I can only describe as, “how did she know??” While the people sitting in front of me turned around and glared at me. 

Because of this I refrained from saying anything more when he tried to covertly keep smoking. (He turned to I couldn’t see him but I could still hear it, see the smoke, and smell the flavor he picked! Cherry if anyone was curious. But he would also glance over at me every time he took a hit to see if I saw.)

I’m a very shy person and have only recently began to voice my problems with strangers in a public setting but I’m done having things ruined for me! I thought I was doing the right thing by telling him to knock it off but the way I was glared at makes me second guess myself. 

So AITA for telling someone not to vape in a theater in not the quietest way?

Now complete the following example-
input: Okay, so I'm a college kid studying education. I have 20 credit hours and two jobs at the moment. My schedule is packed and requires careful planning an maneuvering when it comes to planning stuff. I get paired with one of my friends in an education class. We'll call her Alex. Alex and I have been friends for two years. She does not have a car, I do have a car. She has a tendency to charge forward and plan/schedule things without consulting partners, thinking she'll be helpful. She also has this tendency to expect rides from me because she doesn't like walking around in the cold.

So fast forward to today. I'm rolling groggily out of bed, pissy and uncomfortable, and I get a text from Alex. She's like ""make sure to come by my apartment later at 2:30 for our observation clinical!"". I was confused because of ""our"". I did not plan an observation at all, so I text her like ""what do you mean by ""our""? ""Oh! I told Dr. Prof that you could come today! You are free Tuesday afternoons, so I figured it would be fine.""

Typically, yes, I am free Tuesday afternoons, but not today. I had to pick up a shift at the daycare I work at because, due to one of our teachers passing away unexpectedly, we're shortstaffed and scrambling to remain in ratio. I felt bad so I took the shift to lighten the load on our director. I told her that it was going to be tough at work and I was planning on doing the observation *next* week, when things were a little less crazy, but I'd consider trying to find a gap this week. In the end, I didn't find a gap and didn't tell her, which I should have. But she didn't ask my schedule when planning this.

I was really mad. She became the brunt of all my anger and frustration for the past month. All my lack of sleep, my loss of a friend, my constant running, never getting to relax... I called her and exploded. I was yelling into the phone, asking her why the hell she would schedule something that important without consulting me, we're supposed to be partners, she knows this semester has been awful for me, why would she do this...

She just squeaked out the saddest ""I was trying to help"" and then hung up. She's not answering my texts, but her boyfriend and all our friends are asking me why she's so upset. I don't even know if we're still going to this observation clinical or she needs a ride. I called off work. I brought my clinical clothes to campus today. I feel like an awful bitch for yelling at her because I think I overreacted... But I also feel like I'm being guilted into feeling this way by her and the people in our friend group siding with her. Am I the asshole here or am I justified in feeling this frustrated and upset?

Now complete the following example-
input: I used to be friends with three people, and we were pretty close and would all talk or play games almost every day. The friendship wasn’t too long, as it only lasted for about 4 months. 

While I was friends with them, I was struggling through mental problems like depression and anxiety, and so I was beginning to rely on to them as my main source of happiness once the school year ended (understandably a bad thing), since I didn’t really have any other friends at the time and was having trouble with social anxiety.

 Once August  came by, there was an instance where two of them were just talking privately, and due to past experiences, I felt that it was to avoid me since they weren’t responding to me asking if they wanted to play a game or just talk, and responded to everything else being said. I mentioned that to them and they told me it was just something personal, but they were playing something afterward since it wasn’t a long conversation and just decided to stay in their private call instead of moving where me and this other friend could join in. Moving on after that occurrence and September, I started having more thoughts that they secretly hated being around me and didn’t actually appreciate my company, and were doing it just out of pity or something. This gave me a lot of anxiety, especially since I kept repeating a problem like back in August where I thought they just wanted to avoid and get rid of me.  Eventually it got to the point where they did in fact want space away from me, and yet I still joined their lobby in game and asked what was happening, and if they just wanted to get rid of me or something. Eventually it caused one of these friends to feel like I was just directing it all on her, since I began specifically making my messages toward her out of anxiety because they went silent. This made her really upset since she usually goes quiet to calm herself down and not say anything she might regret, 

A day later, I talked to her and the other friends about it and she was very angry at me for what I kept doing and repeating. I tried saying that I was sorry and not trying to do it on purpose, and they were all aware of me being really depressed and having some other troubles. Eventually the conversation spiraled into her saying something about wanting to be friends, and wanting to be someone I can rely on if I need them, but I need to stop causing her and the rest of them feel like they are being controlled by me and that I need to stop doing that. Afterward i don’t remember what I said, but I remember something the lines of I don’t know what to do and that I’m just sorry about everything I kept doing, I just don’t know how to stop feeling like that and repeating it. She started crying during the call after what I said and left it for the rest of the night. 

A day later, I notice she made her own discord server and the other two friends were in it. I found it on social media since I thought it was just something interesting so I joined it. I was kicked out a bit later and messaged her and the other friends what exactly was going on. I was under a lot of stress and worry that this was all going to be a repeat of the past and what I kept being scared of happening, which was them getting rid of me. She never replied to the message or call I tried sending, and the other two friends just basically told me they don’t know. As more and more time went on, more problems arose between me and the other two friends since I kept talking to them for support throughout my confusion, and getting upset and asking too much from them. 

One day, the conversation I had between one of the friends led to him telling me he was taking screenshots of all of our conversations throughout each week, showing them to her and the other friend. A bit later, things spiraled down and he got upset and cried because he felt attacked due to me using bolding, caps lock, etc. to kind of show my surprise and confusion as to why he would be doing that. A little later I got a long message from her saying that I’m being unempathetic to all of them and that she wants me to no longer talk to her at all. I asked if I can respond and was told it would be just a waste of time, but I tried saying I’m sorry anyway. The next several days felt awful for me, and I kept talking to the other two friends as well as other people for help. I eventually came up with sending an apology letter and gift despite being told in her long message that an apology was “way overdue.” I asked if she got it the same night and all I got was a thumbs up emoji. 

Another week or so passed, and during the amount of time I spent seeking support and advice on what was going on, I was given the suggestion and idea to try calling her just for closure on it all and apologize or something. I tried doing that, and I kept saying “hello?” Because no one was responding. Eventually they hung up and I got an angry message from one of the friends asking why and if I was trying to call her. Later that day I noticed she left my discord server, as well as another one of the friends in our circle. I messaged her what happened and why this was going on, why apologizing didn’t matter and that I just don’t understand. I got blocked from every social media and removed from them. She got forced out of my class we shared at school for the semester, and I was forced to do it for the second semester so she could have the teacher for the second half of the year. 

Over the course of all of that I had looked for help and support for my anxiety and problems, and I’ve made newer friends and became an overall less anxious and clingy person, but still get uncomfortable knowing that if I see them, I cannot contact them at all or think of them as a close friend anymore. They’ve also been rude when I did try contacting them those times, and one of the other friends blocked me as well since they kept insulting me when i tried messaging them about it all and I decided to insult them back, and so I got blocked as well. The third friend understands what I’m going through and knows I’m sorry, but said he’s just staying away for his own past experiences and in case of this happening again, since it was a huge negative impact on him.

 So... AITA in this whole situation?

Now complete the following example-
input: Hi everyone, throwaway here. Sorry if this is long.

Backstory: my friend has been with his current gf for a while, she definitely has a weight problem but it’s never something I have brought up. 

Anyways,

I was at at my best friends Super Bowl party yesterday, he invited about 10 friends and told a couple of us to bring our dogs. I have a 95 lb German Shepherd, and he has a 60ish lb pitbull mutt. These dogs are literally best friends for over 2 years and do everything together. We take them everywhere together and they absolutely love each other. Most dogs are scared of my dog for how big he is, and this is literally the only dog friend he has so he gets a little crazy when he sees him. They love to play..they are both extremely energetic and have spent 3+ hours nibbling and chasing each other before.  It’s always super cute and we just let it happen because they love it.  

Now, we were watching the game...most people were just drinking or talking and at this point I’m pretty drunk. Now our dogs are in the other room making a bunch of noise chasing each other, me and my buddy have no problem with it. At some point my friends GF, asked us if we could shut them up or if I could put my dog in their kennel. (My dog never goes in a kennel at this point in his life). We both insisted that it is fine, and yelled at our dogs to keep quiet. They immediately stopped making noise but kept playing. At some point our dogs knocked over an expensive clock they had while we were playing a drinking game. Friends GF instantly screams, gets up, and hits both of our dogs. My dog instantly growled and snapped at her but did not bite her, and then ran over to me. 

I got mad and asked her why the hell she hit my dog, she went on a rant talking about how annoying my dog is and how she doesn’t want him in her house anymore. She proceeded to yell at me for how untrained my dog was (he isn’t, however I got him from a German Shepherd sanctuary when he was 2 and he was a handful back then) he’s perfectly trained now that he’s older and I haven’t had a problem with him since he was adopted. At this point I got mad and told her to stop bitching..she goes off on me and calls me an asshole. Best friend gets involved and yells at us to stop. We stop.

30 mins later  I’ve drank a bit more and our dogs are still playing, causing no harm just messing around with each other. I can tell she is fuming because she is just staring at them. She asks me “why the fuck is your dog so annoying” and I’m pretty hammered and I respond “maybe your fat ass ate all his kibble, I know you always eat Stella’s (friends dog). She goes irate and tells me to get out of her house with all her friends backing her up. I yelled a couple of a pretty mean insults at her involving her weight and a lot of the guys started laughing which didn’t help. My best friend also hasn’t said a word during this.. she tells me to leave and I tell her fine but she needs  to wait because I’m hammered and need an Uber. She says no and starts pushing me out the door. She’s a pretty big girl and I’m struggling to stay inside while her and her friends are pushing me out the door. (I didn’t even have my dog packed up). My other drunk friends are just laughing.. my dog sees what is going on and runs over and bites one of her friends on the arm who was pushing me, he drew blood but I later found out he didn’t get her too good. Anyway, after this they start yelling how they’re gonna get my dog killed for biting and call the cops.i grabbed him and got the fuck out of there and drove home with my dog (real bad choice I know, but I was being drunk and was emotional)...After last night my best friend won’t talk to me or respond to any of my calls. I know i shouldn’t have made fun of his girlfriends weight but I really feel like she overreacted.

Now complete the following example-
input: hey, first of all, thx for the judgement on my last post.

yesterday evening, my girlfriend (27) of a year and me (m27) wanted to watch a movie, i had already opened the shining on netflix and went to the toilet real quick. when i came back, lina looked at me kind of shocked and said that she wanted to brows netflix and accidently hovered over one of my bookmarks, where she found porn sites. They are pretty old bookmarks from like 4 years ago (I know, stupid on me to leave them) and I told her exactly that. She then asked whether i watch porn, and I said that while I haven't watched it in a while 'cause I'm super happy with our sexlife, I have watched it while we're in a relationship.

That's where her whole world fell apart, she started crying, said she is disgusted.. I said it doesn't mean anything at all, that she is my center of attention and the one who i desire over everything and that our sexlife is awesome, and that i did it because we're in a long distance relationship and it can get my imagination going etc. She said that makes it worse. She is disgusted and humiliated that i would masturbate to other women's bodies, and to see them cum, and that i lied when i told her a couple of days ago that she is the only one i want, she says that i don't suffice her. she says apparently the nudes she sends me aren't enough, and i said that i love them over everything and masturbate to them all the fucking time. i tried to explain and explain, that for me it isn't attached to feelings, just visual, but she didn't want to hear it, said to go fuck myself etc.. but to be honest i can also understand her, and told her that i would never watch porn again, and that it's reasonable to demand that, but she doesn't want that either.

i'm in her country (europe) for the whole month, and to be honest, the last weeks weren't really easy either, she is quite insecure because of the distance and pretty emotional also.. i tried to console her the rest of the evening but it didn't work at all, she only said that she thought i wasn't like that, that something's broken.. she was inconsolable, and when it was kind of time to sleep, i asked her several times what position would help her the most so that i can cuddle her, and she said several times just sleep in your sleep position. i did that and then she said how i could really leave her to sleep like that.. i tried to console again and tbh became frustrated, and said i'm really trying to do everything to help you her and it's still not enough maybe that's where i am the asshole? i didn't really want to excuse either, and said that i didn't really do anything wrong, maybe also asshole? sorry for this blur, i'm emotional and clueless to and promised not to speak to friends about it..

I don't know what to do, i feel on a communicative level we're not really compatible.. she cried so much and is so sad and broken on the inside, WIBTA for ending it when she comes back from work tonight?

input: To be clear, I am 18 and still relying on my parents for a living. My family is asian.

Last year, my dad bought me a nice camera which i really liked and had a lot of good photos with it.
At first, I agreed to take pictures of 2 or 3 weddings of my cousins with the reason to train my skills which I had absolutely no problem. But things get really uncomfortable after that.

I became kinda tired with the whole thing because I just wanna have some fun in those events not some kind of an unpaid photographer who stands alone in the crowd (Im sure that some of you photographers out there can understand this feeling). However, My parents refused to understand this.

On the first wedding they let it slip. But on the next, they started ranting that I was such an ungrateful and disrepectful kid etc and forced me to do what I hate. In the meantime, the angry me, unable to do anything, resentfully took just enough pictures and sometimes ""forgot"" the camera at home.

Its really stupid because all the weddings have their own professional photographers, and I was there, an amateur, being forced to do a job with no pay. My parents line of reason was that only I have the time to take group pictures of them and the relatives, which a phone can do just fine. It could have been better if nobody cares about the quality of my work, but they do.

AITA, guys? Im starting to feel that they just buy it not for me to develop a hobby but just so that they can have nice pictures.

So on Saturday I was going to pick her up, but she decided to go out with her friends to a party, I was flat broke and didn't feel like being social, so she told me that she would come back when she was done having drinks. Around 3AM I messaged her to see what was going on only to be ignored. I checked her snap story and seen her partying with a bunch of dudes totally drunk. I called her about 9AM to see what was going on only to be berated about how I'm such a prick for calling her so early. We made up and now New Year's eve comes and shes going out again without me because she has friends that would judge her for dating me. So she says she'll come over after new years. I didn't hear a word from her all night. I stayed in waiting for her to call for a ride, which never happened. I tried talking to her tonight and explaining why I felt upset that she ditched me completely on new years. She kept telling me that I'm the asshole for being upset. So, AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: or starters, I'm a male in his mid twenties and until today I was engaged to a woman also in her mid twenties. 
 
We have been through a lot but lately she has been belittling me and not handling her expectations. Back during Christmas she left me while we visited my dad's side of my family. A week later we made up and she announced our engagement. She had been feeling unwell and we found out she was pregnant. I'm nervous and unsure about wanting to be a father buy I've told her I will support her. I've been struggling with depression a lot, I think as a result of her leaving me back in December and my medication no longer working for me. I've started hanging put with friends 4 times a week because seeing my fiancee stresses me out. 

Lately I have not been able to care about us as much as I want to. She's repeatedly bossed me around and told me that I should sleep early or eat better because it will help me. She has tried repeatedly to make me see my psychiatrist, but I'm busy. She struggles from depression and she functions differently. I just wish to be alone right now, so I traveled out to see my mom and I've been staying at her place for a week. Last night my fiancee called to say she felt very depressed and she was afraid she would hurt herself. I was angry and told my mom how I felt. She said that my fiancee was being selfish and needed to back off because she was trying to manipulate me. I decided to call her and see what was wrong. She pretty much told me that she was very depressed and needed me to come back home. I told her I needed to think about it some more. 

This morning she texted me and told me that I needed me to come home and start doing things to fix our relationship or she would leave. I told her she was being selfish and she was only pushing me farther away. About an hour later she called me and I  was ignoring her because I was out getting dinner with my mom. She called my mom thirty minutes later and I told my mom to ignore her too. Eventually she messaged my mom and asked her to tell me to please give her a call. My mom was mad at my fiancee and she told her I needed some time to be alone and I would come home when I was stronger and such.

 My mom also told her that she was making this all about herself and being selfish because I have a right to spend time away from her if I need it. Because my mom has been supportive of me seeking time away from my fiancee, my fiancee accused her of ""setting me up to fail"". When I lived with my mother I had a history of sleeping in during the day and going out at night. My mother was the same, it is how I was raised and I trust her because she also suffers from depression. I know my mother would never do that and she was outraged that my fiancee would accuse her of being a poor parent. She told my fiancee to fuck off and that she would make a terrible mother to our child. I was also outraged that my fiancee would accuse my mother of being a bad mother. I've decided that I will ignore her for the time being. I'm very depressed and I do not want to talk to her or even think about her. Tonight I'm spending the night watching a movie with my mom. My mom has agreed that it is for the best if we block her for tonight at least and put away our phones. 

TLDR: My fiancee wants me to go home while I'm visiting my mom. My mom thinks my fiancee is being a selfish and manipulative person. I've decided to ignore her for the time being.

Now complete the following example-
input: Tldr; my gf says she is too young to settle down with 1 guy for the rest of her life. She really likes getting attention from other guys. A guy tried to kiss her but she said no, because she loves me, but she also said she really wants to be able to kiss people when she is out clubbing. Am i an asshole for saying no i don't want you to kissother people.

Me and my girlfriend, both 22, are going through a rough time. I know that happends to all of us. We have been together for a year and half now. In the beginning we were madly in love (still are, kind of). After some time together she admits to me that she is not ready to settle down. Before you ask, i did not propose to her. 

Let me paint the picture first. 
She used to party very hard, like every weekend. She has hooked up with so many people that she can't go out clubbing without meeting a former ""lover"". She stopped partying over time, before and after i met her. So I did not put an end to it. She likes tk go out to dance, and i've never stopped her.

Me, i am not a very social guy, i rarely go out, i have few and close friends. I am also a VERY jealous guy. She is my second relationship. The first girl tried to use me to get pregnant and cheated on me. So I have some trust issues with girls. I am working on that.

After about 8 months or so together she confesses to me that she is not ready to settle down. We are only 21/22 years at the time. So i think fuck it, we're young i don't wanna stop her from living her life how she wants it. We agree on an open relationship. We love each other, but can hook up with others. She with a couple of people some times and i'm REALLY FUCKING JEALOUS. I never got with anybody because when she found out i was talking to a girl she was on the verge of crying, and became jealous just by me talking to other girls. I never really had to intention to be with anybody else because of trust issues and i never was. After about 2 months we end the openrelationship because we are both too jealous people to cope with it.

We are now exclusive and that's how i want it and she too, kind of. Time goes by and she admits she misses the attention she got when she was single. We talk and both agree that if she is out clubbing she is allowed to talk to and dance with other guys. That is fine with me. 

Tonight she told me that she was out with a friend. She talked with a guy and danced with him for hours. And then he tried to kiss her. She stopped him. Atleast she said she did stop him because she loves me. But then she said she only did it because it was the right thing. She said she was captivated with him, not in love but kind of flattered. She tells me she really wants more. She has said that for her, kissing/making out with guys is for her an appropriate way to thank them for being nice, flirting, dancing with her etc.

She likes getting attention, the kind that makes her feel good about herself. I know getting compliments on your looks feel better from somebodyelse than your boyfriend who calls you beautiful every day.

I told her that im not happy with her if she kisses other guys. I even told her i might end our relationship if there cant be just us 2. And we disagree. She did nothing with the guy as far as i know. She is about 1000 kilometres (600 miles?) away visiting a friend and that is where all this happened. Am i the asshole for telling her no to kiss other guys?

Now complete the following example-
input: Couple friends of mine got ""conned"" into buying a Rainbow vacuum. It's a good vacuum, but it costs almost 4000€ (WTF?!).

Rainbow sells through multilevel marketing schemes, so basically to help pay for the vacuum they need to sell the vacuum to other people (\^.-). Fair enough, I'm not going to spend that much money on a vacuum, but they tell me that by just listening to the sales pitch I'll help them get a discount on their purchase. OK

My friends are still considered ""in training"", so they shadow another couple that are already official reps of Rainbow. They all come over to my house with the vacuum and start their pitch....

They keep going on and on about the toxins in the air and basically all types of scare tactics related to health and hygiene... basically they try and make you feel like you're dirty and you live in filth. Things like asking:

 ""Do you drink tap water? Would you drink the tap water in this deposit if it were in glass?\*turns on the machine to vacuum air, opens up the water deposit full of dirt\* Would you drink this water now?! WOULD YOU?!""

\*vacuums the couch, shows all the dirt that was extracted\* ""WHAT?! Are you going to sit on the couch again?! aren't you disgusted?!""

After about an hour I'd had enough, and I said ""LISTEN This pitch isn't working for me!, show me the functionalities of the vacuum and don't talk about health statistics, I don't care enough about that and I'm not enjoying your tone"" The rest of the pitch became super awkward as I continued to criticise their approach (seems like their script doesn't adapt to ""difficult"" audiences)

(also to clarify the ""health statistics"" were just ridiculously false, basically used to con people that don't know much about the world.)

The Salesperson started to tear up and deemed me a bad fit. I apologised to the couple that was pitching and to my friends and tried to make my criticism constructive. But I still feel bad that I criticised so harshly (and I really ripped them a new one). But I also feel I shouldn't have to put up with someone I don't know, coming to my house and treating me like a filthy idiot. 

My friends seem to think I should have just grin and bear it, AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: Sigh. I think I messed up.

My parents do not live in a very populated US city, they're around 60yo, and my dad's been laid off from his old job about half a year ago. He's been applying for jobs and finally got a written offer.

The offer is for the same amount that he's been getting for years: it's a decent amount but by no means very high.

I don't live with my parents and I work in a different industry, but having gone through several job offers and successful negotiations, I suggested that my dad asks for a +$5k raise. The reply email was crafted very carefully, stating that 1) he appreciates the offer and the initial meeting 2) he's wondering if there's any flexibility in the offer because he believes he can bring a lot to the team and the company and 3) finally asking if they're willing to go for +$5k.

Initially my dad hesitated (I think because he's been tired of searching for a job for so long), but eventually he agreed to try it. My thought process was:

1. He deserves more -- he really is amazing in his industry
2. It's an initial negotiation and he's not asking for an outrageous amount on top of the initial offer
3. He's never agreed to any previous offer from them (or discussed any potential salary), so there's no reason why he can't try to ask for a bit more
4. The email was extremely professional and polite, structured so they could easily have replied back with ""no, that's our best and final offer""

To my shock, the employer's contact called back (not emailed back) 3 days later saying they're rescinding the offer...(!)

Wat. The only reason I can think of is that they were so unsure of whether to hire him or not initially, that they either 1) decided not to bother or 2) found someone else.

Of course my dad feels horrible now, and so do I. And if it wasn't for my convincing, he would probably have that job by now.

Am I the asshole for getting involved and should we not have negotiated?

input: McDonalds is having a promotion where you peel a label off an item and you can win a free item once in awhile.

On this day my wife gave me 2 labels.  One with a free medium fry and one  with a free shake/frappe/cappachino thing.  The free shake thing was worth $2 and I don't enjoy the shakes/frappes/whatever else they are and I just wanted to get a beverage ($1) in place of the free item.

The girl at the front register had no issue with it and just needed the manager to submit the promo for her.  When the manager showed up and seen the label was for a free *something* and not a beverage, I was told that an exchange can not be made.

I explained that I just wanted to get a sweet tea that's worth only $1 and not the more expensive item and to just ring it up as the free *something*  and hand me a cup for a beverage.  To which I was told ""Not exchanges.""

I got slightly frustrated bit kept my cool and asked just for a shake with nothing in it.  So the manager rung it up and gave me a shake cup and lid so I took the empty container and got a sweet tea with it.

AITA for this? Should I have just given my free item to someone else?  I feel like I was THAT customer and I should have just shut up and walked away.

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm not trying to brag or anything, this is relevant to the story. I was fortunate enough to be born into an extremely wealthy family. I'm talking levels of wealth that my future grandkids would not need to work for a single day of their lives. I own a bunch of properties that I buy and sell.

I met a girl about 4 years ago who seemed pretty fantastic. This woman was born into a dirt poor family and went straight into work after highschool. She barely made ends meet but was a happy and humorous girl. We started dating, and for the first year I hid my wealth from her because I didn't want to attract gold diggers. When it became clear to me that she was not a gold digger I told her about my wealth. This did not change our relationship for the most part.

As the years went on I allowed her to stay at one of the properties I own rent free. Beyond that she always dreamed of getting a certain college degree. I was paying for her housing, her food, he utilities and for about half her tuition. This is fine for me. I once again am not trying to sound like a rich douche, but this money that I was spending on her affected me in no way.

Anyways, a few weeks ago I found out she was cheating on me. I broke up with her obviously, and I stopped providing her financial support completely. She works part time. She will not have enough money to pay rent, she will not have enough money for school. I realize that I am not responsible for her financially, but I feel like an ass. I truly am doing this out of spite. I don't need the money, it makes no difference to me. I am knowingly condemning her to liekly homelessness and ruining her chances at a degree out of spite. I think I'm an asshole, am I?

Now complete the following example-
input: My husband (32m) and I (31f) have had issues with his hobby for the last few years. Without getting into specifics, it takes up the majority of his time when he’s not working and he has invested tens of thousands of dollars into it (not sure exactly how much - he hides it from me). We fight about it often as I feel like myself and our daughter (3 yo) always come in second when it comes to the hobby. If I try to plan things on weekends for us to do as a family I have a rare shot at actually finding a window that works for him. It’s also been a long snowy winter for us so our daughter has been cooped up inside. The last family outing that wasn’t just a dinner or visiting family was in October. 

He’s been away for the last week for work and will continue to be gone for another week. While talking on the phone tonight I mentioned taking our daughter to a really good museum a few hours away the first Saturday he’s back. I figured I had a good shot of that Saturday being free as he would have worked the previous 2 Saturdays so he shouldn’t be on call. He informed me that he had a competition related to his hobby that Saturday and I needed to pick another day. I refused to pick a different Saturday (museum is closed Sunday). He then said that I should pick another activity that’s open on Sunday and I refused to do that as well. 

The reason I refused is because we’ve played this game before. If I move the plans to another day - something always comes up (work or hobby related) and then it gets pushed again. And again. And again. Until we just never do it. And I really want to take our kid to THIS museum. It hits all of her current interests and she will have an amazing day. And she deserves it after a winter of playing inside and doing well in school (she has a few delays so she was able to start the special ed preschool a few months ago and has been making huge strides). I’m still planning on taking her, and told my husband we will just go without him. He got upset with me that I wasn’t willing to budge on the activity or the day. 

I know he wants to go and do things with us but I feel like if we were really a priority that he would pick us more than he does. I’m getting tired of us pushing everything in our lives back to make room for his stuff. I get that he’s made a commitment to this competition but he’s attended more competitions this winter than days he’s spent with his wife and/or kid. I feel like giving him a firm ‘this is the day we are doing this - come or don’t come’ is plenty fair.

input: Names are fake for privacy.

I've been living with Roommate for a few years and we get along alright other than the shit we give each other sometimes. Recently, Roommate has been going over to our friend Bill's house to smoke weed. Every time he goes over, he always asks to smoke, and his was of making up for not having his own weed is giving them money. They don't seem to mind it at all, so I guess it works.

Tonight I was hanging out with Bill and Co. and Roommate got stoned. As soon as he did, he wouldn't shut the hell up. Some of the things that happened include:

- Requesting music from Alexa while someone is in the process of picking a song (ex. someone says hey alexa and before they can finish he yells a song real loud)

- Being really loud in general

- Backseating everything we do (ex. someone looks for a clip on YouTube and he says ""hey we should watch this"" repeatedly)

- Taunting people when they ask him to stop being an asshole (ex. a friend told him to shut up and his reaction was ""fuck you ya piece of shit"")

- Yelling when people are beating him in games (its like a low pitched HEY that almost sounds like barking and he won't stop doing it)

This is just a small assortment of how he acts sometimes. It's a big reason I don't hang around him when he smokes. One of our other friends almost punched him for being obnoxious. When he gets home, I planned on taking some time to tell him he needs to stop being such a dick when he's high. I have done that in the past and he has always said ""I can't help it, I'm high. That's just how I act when I'm high."" And I find that extremely hard to believe because I have been stoned before and I never had the urge to yell or anything.

So the big question is would I be the asshole for telling him he's being an asshole?

This is going to be a little long, but the back story is essential for my reasoning.  TL;DR at bottom. 

I'm 23. My sister is 16. We have the same dad and different moms. We both had custody agreements growing up that put us both at my dad's on wednesdays and weekends. Being 7 years apart, we weren't the closest. We also had normal sibling problems and fights. Not getting too far into it, she was definitely my dad's favorite. 

Until I was around 12 or 13 my dad was a heavy alcoholic. Very typical alcoholic at that. He used to punch me, treated me like shit, all the bad stuff. I absolutely hated him growing up. But he finally got sober (I'm more than grateful for it.) Which puts my sister at 5 or 6 years old. So she actually got the better version of dad than I did for the majority of her memory. I don't ever remember him ever laying a finger on her, especially the compared to the stuff I got. 

Fast forward to a couple years ago. I think it started when she turned 13. She started distancing herself from my dad and his family (which is less than 15 people. Small family.) My dad would maybe see her once a month. Then once every 3 months or so. My dad is still kind of a dick, but he has a full heart. He's texted my sister every morning for the past 3 years and never gets a response. She's 90% given up on that side of the family. She says its because of my dads wife, but they've been together for almost 7 years I think, and she loved his wife when they first got together. So none of us really know the reason.  

Fast forward again to last summer. My dad hadn't seen my sister in a full year. He gave in and invited her on the yearly family vacation. She went and on the last day, she punched our step brother, (9yrs old) called our step mom a cunt, and raised her hand to swing at our dad. She told my dad, indirectly, that she expects an apology before she'll talk to him. Which to me is fucking outrageous. 

My Baby's due date was right before Christmas.  Before Thanksgiving my sister, at this point still hasn't seen my dad or family, messaged my GF. She asked, ""even though I don't want to see my dad and his family, can I still see the baby?"" I told my GF to tell her, ""no, that isn't fair to your dad."" She never responded, and now in January, we have a beautiful baby girl and no one has heard from my sister.  My dad and I have great relationship and he absolutely loves his granddaughter. 

TL;DR. My sister gave up on our family and I haven't let her meet my baby. 

So back to the point, AITA for not letting my sister meet my baby?

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm a final year university student working part time and busy for most of my day like everyone else. Three weeks ago my friend, who lives around several hours away from the city we study in, went home to see her family. She was supposed to go for a week, but the next week she was nowhere to be found and did not go to her workplace without giving any notice. We (me and common friends) called and wrote her and she did not respond. I googled car crashes and found none, and she appeared online on facebook messenger so I assumed she must have had a dead relative or something. Pretty much ""she must have a working phone if she appears online so she chooses to not answer"".

&amp;#x200B;

So, for the next week and so I had other colleagues ask me if they heard anything about her. However, I always said I know nothing but I suspect she is fine, explained the dead relative theory and told other people to ""relax, everything is clearly fine, I googled and there were no car crashes etc."". Another week passes and I mention this to my sister and she gives me the absolutely obvious advice to ask her brother. I obviously knew her brother, so I knew she had one. I take this advice and write him on facebook to ask.

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out, she was in a car crash and was in a bad condition at a hospital, and there could be no visits. She luckily has her vitals in check and now I wait for the doctors to allow us to visit her. I found out her family announced one friend of hers. 

&amp;#x200B;

In retrospective, it's obvious that the messenger excuse I made up to myself is pure bullshit. Also, people give some notice when a relative dies, no one disappears like that. It's so painfully obvious now that she must have been in a car crash, and it's so obvious she announced that one friend I mentioned earlier and it's even more obvious that 1-2 days after her absence I should have asked her brother. I don't understand how I could bury my head in the sand like that. I keep telling myself how busy I was and how little a few weeks are but... it's bullshit. I lurked on reddit every night, I could have used my monkey brain for 3 seconds to seriously check on my friend. My actions have unfairly stopped others on checking on her, and she is a great person in a bad place. She does not deserve to think people do not care about her because I convinced people with some extremely sketchy arguments that she must be fine. Maybe if I acted like an adult weeks ahead we could have somehow helped but I didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

So, AITA for actively hurting my friend with my stupidity and indiference? Do I deserve to have friends if I think so little about them?

input: I have a friend who has been staying with me for a few months. He has a dog, who also stays here, cause well, theyre a package. However on Friday he left to visit his daughter and said ""I'll see you in a bit"", and never came back. 

I was going to say something the next morning asking why he never bothered to see if it was okay, but I remembered tht he was visiting his daughter, and thats probably where he still was. So I left it alone until this morning when I had finally had enough and let him know I was quite upset that he had been gone so long without his dog and never bothered to check in or see if I had plans. 

This started an argument about how he didnt think he had to and he was with his daughter so he assumed it would be okay. 

I said it would have been okay had he taken 2 seconds to text me to let me know what was going on. Again he said he didnt think he had to and he would watch my dog if I left. I told him I wouldn't just leave without saying anything or checking in out of respect and responsibility. 

It just continued to spiral from there and during which he kept bringing up that he was visiting with his kid and I should be more understanding. He insisted on bringing his daughter home to her mother from his moms because I made him feel bad so he was going to ""fix it"". I even told him that i wasnt telling him to to come back, but i was telling him that i was displeased after not hearing from him since friday. 

So, am i the asshole because I got upset my friend left friday to see his kid without his dog and never messaged to check in to see if it was okay?

Now complete the following example-
input: Working on mobile, blablabla

I was working for a grocer, large chain which supports health, global social initiatives, so on. I worked as a part time employee while I was in between jobs, but I had wanted the job for years. I thought maybe I could stick around and move up in the company. I have pretty extensive knowledge and skill working with food and do consider myself a diligent employee. 

At first everything seemed to be going well. I was learning quickly, picking up shifts when requested, and within a few months I was tasked with opening the department alone which was normally a management duty. I happily expected and thought everything was going well. I got along with all staff, including the manager. After a few months I started to notice a change.

The manager would get angry. Throwing utensils, punching paper towel dispensers, and just spoke rudely and shortly with myself and a few others. When he was being friendly to me, it was through him speaking poorly of others in the store or department. Or making inappropriate comments about the female staff of the store. This was the beginning of my frustration, but I disregarded and kept doing my best as I wanted to move forward in the company. I wanted to become full time and hoped to get myself into a different department. I always asked for feedback on my performance and how I could improve. I had all intentions on staying around and moving on. 

As time went on, the managers attitude became more and more aggressive. The bad moods lasted longer, the insults were stronger, and it was just not a comfortable environment. I became close with other employees of the department who were also noticing the behavior. We all knew how we would talk about others and it was no surprise to hear what was said until one day a full time position opened, and I was excited. I thought I was doing fine, I was not receiving any negative feedback and was constantly working extra shifts and taking on more responsibility, all given to me by the manager in question. 

When I expressed excitement for the position to my coworkers I was told I'm not getting the job. They were not putting me down as a joke, they were informing me of what the manager said when I wasnt around. That I was too slow, that I would never get a full time position from him, that if I tried to change departments then he would make my life hell, and ended the rant by calling me a ""piece of shit faggot"". 

I was livid, confused, shocked and disappointed. I took my concerns to a floor manager who essentially said this was speculation, he said she said type stuff. My intention was not to have him fired, but to move to another department where I could get proper feedback and opportunity. But because this was supposedly speculation, they had no reason to move me. I then took this to the highest manager of the store. I expressed that I'm not doing this to cause trouble, I just want a fair opportunity. I laid it all on the line, said everything I heard from others and witnesses myself. She asked for me to write it all out and I did. What I didnt know is that she was opening an investigation as it was corporate policy. 

Other team members were called in for interviews, and about two weeks later the manager was escorted from the building. 

I worked at the store for about 6 months, he was there for 6 years in a management role. I dont know how long he had been treating people this way but I didnt feel right at the time. I felt bad for getting the man fired. He had kids and a mortgage as many middle aged men do, I never wanted to be responsible for adding that stress to a person's life, even if he wasnt quite fair to me. 

Additionally, after the investigation, all of the employees who came forward on this behavior were fired for very small reasons. I resigned about a month later as the environment from management was cold. They didn't want to fire the guy either, but the policy of investigation caused him to be let go. The highest managers of the store were crying over losing this employee, almost as if his behavior should have been disregarded? And I was given a cold shoulder from most other employees of the store, as many were not aware of this behavior. 

Am I the asshole here? The way I was treated after the fact makes me feel like I am. But at the same time, that behavior to be allowed in such a store, such an environment, is just appalling.

input: Throwaway because people I know are aware of what my main account's username is.

I (M20) am a college student, and I go to school out of state - my family live a couple states away, about 2 hours by flight and about 12 hours by car. My little sister (F18) has applied to a couple different schools, and her dream school was the one I attend, but she was rejected this week from the school and has to start looking elsewhere. She and my dad (M55) and mom (F53) have been talking about visiting schools sometime this month.

This afternoon I missed a call from my dad, who left a voicemail just asking him to call him back. I did, and my dad started asking me about when my classes for the week ended and what days off I had next month. I told him but cautioned that I frequently have plans with my friends on the weekend, and I overheard him over the phone telling my little sister to ""look up available dates"". I asked him point blank what was going on, and he told me that my little sister, he, and my mother were going to go to some of the schools that my little sister had been accepted to, and they wanted me to fly home to watch the dog and house sit for possibly multiple weekends next month.

I was a little incredulous at this - my twin brother (M20) is at college at a school much closer than me and regularly visits home for the weekends, something that I rarely have the luxury to do. My family also knows many people with whom our dog is quite friendly, so it's not like they \*need\* me around. The dog has some medical issues and will get very stressed if he is separated from his family, however, but we have gone on extended trips without him several times without significant issues.

I told my dad this, and he said that he wanted me to dog-sit, and would pay for me to fly home. I felt really uncomfortable with this (a plane ticket would be something like $300, and the cost of getting a friend to dog-sit would be far less, or even free if my brother was available, though my father is well enough off that finances are not a significant obstacle for him). He asked me when I would be available for the weekend, and I told him point blank that I simply did not want to do it. I often go out and do things with my friends on the weekends, and I thought that it was a waste of my time and his money to send me home just to dog sit. I am not home sick or anything, and the thought of flying home to an empty house for a weekend is not something I enjoy.

He accepted it, we talked for a little bit more, and then we ended the conversation. A few minutes later, he called me back, and said that he was quite angry at me for saying no.

He said that he was only asking a favor of me, and that he had spent the past twenty years doing favors for me (including paying for my college, plane tickets home for winter/spring break), and that he felt offended that I had declined to do this favor for him, and that he did not like that I had declined without giving him specifics with regard to availability. I told him that I appreciated all of the favors that he had done for me throughout the years, but I did not feel comfortable doing this for him as I did not think it was a smart move on either his part or my part. I apologized for offending him. He did not ask me again to come home and dog sit, and I did not offer. We ended the conversation again, but I got the impression that he was still angry.

Am I the Asshole? Even if my dad has no issue spending that money for a plane ticket home, I did not want to go home to an empty house and a dog for a weekend, and I thought that it was unreasonable of him to expect that of me.

input: WIBTA? 
Background: So I have a bit of a messy mental state around sex. I have a history of just giving partners whatever they want sexually so they won't be sad and some of them have definitely taken advantage of that fact. But I'm working on it and I need an outside perspective on this one. 

Anyway I have been trying to explain to my current boyfriend that when he's upset and wants sex (to feel better about something unrelated, he isn't upset he's not getting sex) it makes me feel a lot of pressure to do it. We've talked about how it makes me worried that I shouldn't say no and that I'd like him to masturbate if he thinks he needs sexual release when I'm feeling depressed.

Well tonight he refused to masturbate. He refused to talk out the issues he was having, I really tried to help but he was having an anxiety filled day so wouldn't listen. I said we could have sex, we did, I just lay there but he just wanted to get off and I am fine with that sometimes. But after I just felt upset. He rolled off me and said he felt guilty because it felt like he 'used me' and I just didn't want to deny it. I said 'I mean you did, what does it matter anyway'. Then he said 'I can't believe you're doing this to me' and we had a fight about it, I got angry he cried and I just felt pressured to say sorry (I haven't yet). 

 I don't care that I wasn't into the sex. I only care that I felt pressured again to make him feel better through sex. He didn't stamp his feet at me, but he was freaking out and not talking to me and I know sex fixes it. He knows that messes with my head but I don't think it's on purpose? When he does that I panic... But now I'm wondering is this just my problem?

Now complete the following example-
input: So the problem is exactly as it's above. My friend thought it was a good idea to post a picture of him and his friend H (who is incidentally my girlfriend, but I know he has no ill intentions) with a cheesy romantic caption (a joke, according to him), on the day of his 2 year anniversary with his girlfriend, M. According to him, M had agreed to the picture being posted, but I'm assuming he said nothing about the caption he would use, or the picture just being H and him awkwardly staring at each other, a picture that would definitely look wrong to a fourth person not in our friends group. Now he wonders why M won't talk properly to him, and believes she's being childish. So does my girlfriend H.
 
But I side with M. It was 1 out of 365 days of the year, and supposed to be their special day. 
AITA in doing this, or is he wrong?

input: Starting with the sperm donation, a lot of alcohol was consumed, I don't remember much of the night and the next thing I know I'm waking up in a stranger's bed. I don't know her and I quickly get out of there and proceed to never talk to her again. 

Anyway, approximately 16 weeks later, it was almost forgotten about until a Facebook message came through from a name I didn't recognise. In the message, I'm told this person is pregnant and not only that but this child is mine. 

So I replied that I don't want anything to do with this child and that she should get an abortion. It's worth mentioning that she lives in a country abortion is illegal, however, I offered to fly her to a country the procedure is legal. She declined. It's worth mentioning here that I have also said that will pay any child maintenance fees, although, I have still made it clear that, aside from my financial responsibilities, I want nothing to do with this child. 

Most recently, she has asked me about ""my boy"" with the implication that I have a relationship with him. I told her that she chose to have a child, not me, and that you have to choose to be a father. I'm a sperm donor. She replied with just OK.

Now complete the following example-
input: I work as a lifeguard at a private community centre. We had a regular come in the evenings and we would often talk about hockey and just sports in general. The community centre is mostly used by middle aged to retired Caucasian people. 

One day we were discussing Superstars like McDavid,Matthews, Crosby, etc. he was saying how they were probably scouted as a young kid and how they're fantastic. Then he said ""just like how you would have probably been scouted for soccer(points at co-worker) and you at computer games(points at me)"" While he was pointing at me he was laughing as he said it. He then jumped into the pool without letting me respond. 

I felt very offended that he would assume I played computer games and that I would be scouted for them. I called him out and said I don't like how he said that I would be good at video games because I'm Chinese. He got defensive and questioned why I would think that saying that I am young and assumed I played them. However, my coworker who was similar aged yet different ethnically would not get scouted for computer games?

From then on, he doesn't really talk to me anymore, and mostly just talks to the other lifeguard. In my opinion, it felt like he was associating being Chinese with being good at computer games. 

for context, I am a american born Chinese person, and he was a retired Caucasian man, and my co-worker was a bigger caucasian male. 

Am I overreacting and am I the asshole?

input: So my girlfriend and I were just got off the phone two minutes ago. We were talking about how her and her friend were getting into a falling out situation and it was stressing her out and she was talking to me about it and I tried to talk to her and give her some of my own perspective about it. I gave her my opinions on it and how I felt like she was doing the right thing for herself but at the same time I felt like her and her friend should maybe have a heart-to-heart because they've been friends for a really really long time (it's also her cousin) and it was very important to her that they stayed friends. 

The way things were going they were just going to not be friends eventually and she plans on moving in a little while and she considered just having that be a reset button and I was saying how eventually she's going to have friendships like that no matter where she lives and she's not always going to be able to do a full reset like that. I said it wouldn't maybe be a bad thing to try to work this friendship out before she leaves and at least try to figure something out because she's not always going to be able to just move away. This is a very TL;DR version of the conversation, we talked for over an hour.

1. We live in Texas 2. I bought these tickets BEFORE he told me we have to go to this funeral 3. Who waits 8 months to have a funeral?

I showed him my previous post and he informed me that the reason they are having the funeral in July is so they can throw her ashes into the ocean / have a bbq swim party.

input: I am putting together a D&amp;D campaign where I going to be a first-time DM and more people have expressed interest than I am able to accommodate. I'm trying to keep it to 4 players but I could do 5, and there are two interested people whose schedules fit with the rest of the group: a coworker who has played D&amp;D with before, and someone from my meetup groups who hasn't played before.

The coworker really, *really* wants to join the campaign and has told me stuff like that she's already rolled a character and come up with a great backstory even though I've told her that I'm not sure if there is space for her yet. I wish there was some other legitimate reason I could not extend the invitation, but in actuality it all comes down to her nails.

I wouldn't go as far as to call it a phobia, but I have an extreme aversion/fear of any kind of damage or abnormality in fingernails. A friend made a comment about a certain type of injury and I literally couldn't get it out of my head for two days. Even typing this post is making me anxious. This coworker happens to have severe damage in that area and doesn't cover it at all. I don't see her much at work because our desks face away from each other but whenever I see her hands I feel queasy and it really gets to me. Currently I can't afford to go to therapy to address whatever this issue I have is.

It seems like a shallow reason to not invite someone because she is a really nice person and I know she would be a great player and it really just comes down to an aspect of her appearance, but I just don't know if I could stomach having her hands in full view for 3 hours a week. AITA if I don't extend the invitation? Am I off the hook since I told her from the start that I was just gauging interest and couldn't guaranty anyone a slot?

Now complete the following example-
input: I’ve worked in a small office for about 5 years. A few of us are pretty tight knit both in and out of the office, including texting, buying breakfast or lunch, drinks after work, etc.   

There’s one coworker, Jay, who we try to include but he has a lot of issues. He’s miserable to be around most of the time; and that’s when his meds are stable.  When his meds aren’t stable it’s like walking on eggshells. There have even been multiple times Jay has been suspended for his behavior.

If it weren’t for making work more comfortable, I would NOT be friends with Jay. 

Jay may just be socially awkward but whenever he sees one of us doing something for another (not a group thing) he always asks why we didn’t do the same for him or why he was left out or why we didn’t bring him a gift back from our vacation (just to clarify, no one buys gifts for anyone else while on vacation, but Jay seems to think we should bring something back for him), etc., and gets legitimately upset or even angry at us. Jay also announces when his birthday is coming up weeks in advance and implies we are all responsible for making him happy on his birthday by providing gifts, cake, etc. All of this behavior has resulted in us buying him meals or small gifts to not set him off. Sometimes he seems thankful but other times he is rude saying he doesn’t like whatever it is you got for him or claiming it tastes so awful you must be poisoning him, etc.  

All of that said, probably 4-5 months ago, Jay bought me a gift card to a coffee shop and it caught me so off guard that I teared up a little bc I honestly couldn’t believe he had done this.  

About a week ago, another coworker, Joe, who is probably the closest of all of us to Jay, had a huge blowup that ended in Joe telling Jay that he is an entitled asshole. Joe told Jay that he never does anything for any of us and why should we continue to do things for him. I was brought up as a very specific example because I tend to be a doormat and do more for Jay than most of the rest. 

Fast forward to this week and Jay asks me to come over to his and Joe’s section of the office. I comply and when I get there I’m handed a gift card for the same coffee shop. I thank Jay, talk a little bit and return to my desk. About 5 minutes later Jay lets me know that Joe has accused him of doing that for “show” and told him how rude of him it was to “parade me through the office” like that.  So I ask Jay if it was for a show because he could’ve just as easily walked the gift card to my desk and given it to me privately. Jay admitted he wanted Joe to see him giving me the giftcard.  

I’ve let this all digest for a few days and I’m not sure I’m comfortable accepting the giftcard and am thinking of returning it to Jay with a “thanks but no thanks” (not sure exactly what to say without offending him or setting him off, tbh).  

So reddit, WIBTA if I returned the gift card?

input:   

Ok long story short, in February 2017 the father of my wife asks me to support them temporally because he had to move to the city (he has just got a government contract, and as he didn't know how long is was going to be. OK I agree to not be the asshole. Time past and they only pay for utilities (almost all of them, but still is less than 20% of the rental market value of the house), now we must move for job reasons. So, the thing is, since we left the house, they ask to stay there but we didn't set the terms because mainly of the rush of moving and secondly because she don't let me talk directly to them (it has been an issue forever). Well bottom line, has been three and a half months since we leave and yesterday, she came over to me saying that ""she has just collected the rent from her parents"". “OK, let me see”, and it was only one month, that when I said ""WTF, they have year and a half sharing the hose with us plus three months having it for themselves and they only pay one month at half the market value?"" she was like ""oh, youtheasshole, my poor parents (they aren’t, he had just give away a car to his sister and always brag about how much he wages and how much he has in the bank), how I can collect backwards? that's crazy"".

So, the first question is AITA for asking for the money (we're pretty thigh right now, and we pay a lot of rent)?

After that she said, I don't want trouble (nor talk with my parents), so here's this check covering your 2 months share that I didn't collect.

Second question, AITA for accepting that money?

A little bit of background about our finances is that we leverage all the expenses and each of us pays a proportional (in relation to the individual income) of the expenses, and she never forgive me any expense or payment (for example if any of us makes 2x the other income it must pay 66% of the expenses).

Now complete the following example-
input: My boyfriend \[21\] and I \[20\] have been together for nearly a year and a half, and I love him to pieces. We've always gotten along well with each other, but recently things have gotten rockier than usual. Throughout our entire relationship, he has had an issue with punctuality, often leading us to change plans or postpone things at my inconvenience. Since we first began dating, he has also had a sleep schedule much different than mine: he'd frequently go to bed at 3-4 am and wake up at noon, while I'd go to bed at 11 pm and wake up at 7 am. I've found this understandable in the past, as he was in the process of applying to graduate school and was quite busy/stressed for several months. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, it's been nearly a year since we've moved in together and, despite his schedule returning to normal, he now goes to bed at 6 am and wakes up at 2 pm. While before he was staying up to catch up with work, he now stays up to watch tv shows or play video games. This turns into a major inconvenience to me when he leaves the bedroom lights on until the early morning, making it difficult for me to fall asleep at night. I've spoken to him about this in the past, and he has agreed to turn off the lights and take his computer to a different room after midnight. However, for the last week, he's been back in the usual routine of going to bed at 6 and waking up at 2. Last night, he stayed up until 6 am talking loudly to a friend on the phone, causing me to lose several hours of sleep. After he was finally finished with his conversation, I had a brief talk with him about how I would like to move out if this continues. Once again, he has agreed to keep the lights off after midnight, but I don't know if I can take much more of this if it continues. I'm a university student and, in addition to classes, I work a part-time job, and I'm worried that if things don't change (as I suspect they won't), it is my future that will be affected. I can't stress how much he means to me, but I question if it is really worth continuing to date him if we only get to spend a 3-4 hours together each day (incl. weekends). AITA for wanting to break up with him over something as trivial as having a different lifestyle than me?

input: This is my first post, so, I’m sorry if the formatting is wrong.

Just by the title, I sound like an asshole, but, here is the full story. I was talking to one of my friends one day, let’s call him Z, and be let me know that the other friend, let’s call him BF, has been distant, and ignoring his friends recently. Z asked me to confront BF about this, and I did, telling him that I was happy he was in a relationship, but he needed to put some time away for his friends. He told his girlfriend about this, and she has been ignoring me ever since. (I used to be good friends with her). I am still friends with BF, but I have my doubts about what I did.

Now complete the following example-
input: So, some more context. This was at a dinner in front of a group of friends as well as some people I didn't personally know. The girl (who I knew) asked me if I'd date someone with depression, because they were talking about dating with depression and wanted my opinion as someone healthy. 

I was really put on the spot and said something like ""well if my bf became depressed I would definitely support him no matter what."" Then she said ""no not your current boyfriend, I meant like would you BEGIN dating someone already depressed if you were still single?""  

It was awkward as fuck and I just stammered a bit and said ""um I guess not... But it's just I don't think I'd be a great partner to someone with severe depression."" At this point several people rolled their eyes and just said something like oh classic person who doesn't understand that depressed people are just normal people. I kinda kept my mouth shut for the rest of the night. 

A few days ago that friend messaged me saying that next time I get that question I need to be way more supportive. She said that several people were really offended by what I said and only reinforced their view that depressed people are unlovable and will never get dates. I got a bit defensive and said that it was unfair for her to put me on the stop, but she just told me to ""get over myself"" and learn some ""empathy."" W/AITA for what I said?

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm going to try to keep this concise as its not too big of a situation, but I like writing so no promises. Also, sorry about mobile formatting.

I'm a 19 year old guy, that might be relevant to some of you when making your judgement. So my family is pretty traditionalist, especially my dad. I value tradition and am conservative myself, but being raised in Canada has made me see things a bit differently than they do. So the scene is Christmas Eve, and as per usual my parents Skype their families (almost all of my extended family lives in Poland, so thats our only form of communication) to wish them a Merry Chrsitmas and talk for a bit. Usually I'd join in, but this year I really wasn't feeling it, so as soon as my dad motioned for me to come to the computer, I instead went upstairs.

Reason for this is twofold: First, I haven't seen any of that family in 4 years (that was the last time we flew to Poland), so I feel we grew apart naturally. Second, when I was in Poland, I tried my best to engage with my cousins and talk about stuff, but because of the language barrier (I understand Polish perfectly, but speak it very poorly) and different interests, they didn't seem especially interested in talking to me. My uncles, aunts, and grandparents talked to me more, but that was just the standard ""so how's life, how's school"" type of thing, just felt artificial. I spent most of that trip just with my brother.

So essentially, I feel like these people are my family in name only. I don't care about them, don't want to waste my time talking to them. I have 2 cousins that live in Chicago with whom I talk to fairly often (no language barrier, I can relate to them fairly well, and I visit them once a year, even by myself if my parents can't make the trip), I'm super close to my parents, and my brother is my best friend. I feel like that's family enough for me, and I have close friends that I'd sooner call family than the Poland people.

Now the asshole part. After the Skype call was over, my dad stormed into my room and yelled, saying he was deeply offended that I wouldn't talk to his family, and that he didn't raise me to be such a bum(?) My parents and I speak Ukrainian, so the insults he hurled at me were in Ukrainian and I'm not sure if that's an appropriate translation, it means something like that but a bit more derogatory. His reaction came as a total surprise to me. I expected he'd be unhappy, but I don't see it as such a big deal. I promised I'd join the call next time to get him to calm down. We've since reconciled, but it's been on my mind, I feel guilty but don't really want to adjust my belief on this.

Should I try to put on a show for my dad and be nice to these people? Should I genuinely try to build a relationship with them? Should I put my foot down? Am I the asshole?

So me and my girlfriend have been together for a maybe a couple of months and recently I’ve just started to get upset at the way she talks to my friends. She’s so chatty and energetic when talking to all my friends but when she talks to me it’s so much quieter and like she doesn’t even wanna be there. Recently we were walking around and she was basically silent and hardly engaging in my conversation and then the moment we ran into a friend she perked up and began initiating conversation and seemed a lot happier. When I asked her about this she got mad at me saying that it’s “comfortable silence” and that I shouldn’t even care how she acts around other dudes coz we’re dating. 

Is it wrong to be upset at her over this kind of stuff?

Now complete the following example-
input: So A bit of Backstory. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 21yo(F) currently in my first year of college. One of my first required classes was, obviously, a College level math course. Due to some severe anxiety and a hearing disability I decided I would be better off taking my Colleges online classes rather than the brick and mortar classes. My online math class started off pretty well, the teacher put up an announcement stating the class was starting, where we needed to go to submit assignments, ect.   


The problem didn't really start till after the second set of assignments were due. (Basically you had two assignments due every two weeks, a hand written review test of the chapter and a set of worksheet that added up to like 100-120 math problems). The first week went fine, I submitted my stuff early. The second week I ended up waiting till two days before the due date for the assignments because I got sick. I logged in to the school website to start my assignments only to find that they had been closed early. Emailed the teacher, got no reply. Called the teacher, got no reply. I sent a copy of my assignments in via email and wrote a complaint to technical support in case the problem was with the website and not the assignment. Tech support got back to me and told me that the assignments had been closed by the teacher and not them. I ended up letting it go and took the hit to my grade for not submitting the assignments. Just to make sure, I did the next four weeks worth of assignments in the next three days so they wouldn't be missed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then came my midterm. It was a whopping 500 points. Now, this is in a class that only had a max of about 1,500 points available to be scored. My final exam was also 500 points and then the last 500 was divided among the review tests and the worksheets. I studied like hell for my midterm and I took as much time as I could to let the information sink in. Five days before the midterm due date I went to take it. Only to find it closed. I emailed him 12 times. Called him 22 times. I drove up to the college to try and get in touch with him only to find out his classes were in the central college (About an hour away from me). I ended up having to go into my academic advisers office, in tears and having a panic attack, because I thought I was going to fail his class since that midterm was 1/3 of my grade and I had already two assignments worth of work. She called the Dean of Education with me sitting beside her and I had to explain what was going on while still having a panic attack. The Dean emailed him and got a response back within 10 minutes and the assignment was reopened with an extended due date.  (I got 489/500) The professor then went on to do that with two more assignments (After the mid term I just shotgunned the rest of the assignments because I couldn't go through that again so I didn't get caught up in that whirlwind again.)  


About ten days before the end of the  semester the college sent out course performance reviews. I gave him a *scathing* review. So Scathing, in fact, that his boss The Dean of STEM called me and asked why I was so negative about the course. Now, I have several friends that have the same major as me and two of them ended up taking this guys class. However, they took the in school class rather than the online one. I ended up telling them about the review I left and they both got incredibly angry with me. They said that it wasn't fair for me to have given him such a bad review, that they're classes went perfectly fine and he was such a nice guy, and that I probably negatively effected his peers view of him and other things. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't intend to hurt the Prof. I just wanted to give my honest opinion about the course. But now that I'm going over it and I have my friends opinions on the guy I can't help but feel bad? Like I and a few other people in his online class had a horrible experience with him but his normal classes all love him? AITA here? Should I not have given him such a bad review even though I had a negative experience?

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm currently studying abroad in Europe but before I left (about a month ago) I had to move out of my apartment a couple days before my flight. I talked with a friend (who is with me on this study abroad trip) of mine like a month in advance to make sure it was okay with his roommates that I would stay at their house for 2 nights so I wasn't homeless and they all agreed. I slept on a couch, and in the morning (as I still had classes) would go to school, shower at the gym, go to classes, eat at the cafeteria for lunch, and buy my own snacks/Jimmy John's on the way home for dinner.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, it's now about a month later and **my friend tells me** that his roommates insist I pay them $10 to help with the bills. AITA for being reluctant to pay? Honestly it's not that much money (which is an argument that can go both ways) but I would feel so much better about paying if the roommates were to politely ask me themselves during my stay instead of telling my friend to tell me to pay up a month after the fact. I just feel like it was a rude execution on their part but that's for Reddit to decide. I did already pay them.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand I should've probably done something or offered to pay a little bit but because I had planned this in advance and it was with a good friend I felt it wasn't super necessary especially since I didn't really use any of their utilities except some internet (which they pay like $30 a month for).

So my friend is pro-Black and pro-feminism and she constantly shares pro-black and pro-feminism articles, videos, etc. on Facebook. I don’t have a problem with that, she can share whatever she wants. 
But it’s come to a point where she only shares the stuff BECAUSE it’s a black person or a woman, or even a black woman that is in the video/wrote the article. I asked her if she even read the articles and did more research into the stories, and she told me that she reads the articles, but doesn’t do further research. I said she should so she could get a better understanding and have more details about the article/video.
She then said it doesn’t matter and that I shouldn’t get worked up over something so small. I talked to some other mutual friends, and they sided with her and said I was overreacting.
So I feel the need to ask: AITA for questioning my friend if she actually cares about what she shares on FB?

The next stop a women gets on my tram and sais “excuse me can I sit down you’re a male and so you’re legs are stronger” I replied “sorry ma’am I’m so tired if I stand I will faint but I’m sure somone will get off soon”

She then got heated and said. “This is so sexist you’re not standing because I’m a women, pig” really loudly and the person next to me sais mate just get up don’t be rude. She thanks the person next to me and I felt ganged up on. I told them if you were in my position what would you do. They said” always stand up for a lady don’t be rude.” 

I would always stand for people who need it but why should I stand just because I’m a male

AITA for refusing to stand?

She got all offended and the people we were with were like wtf you can't say that. I was like why not but they had no answer and they all just left.

Now complete the following example-
input: My work provides free coffee. Bless. We brew it ourselves out of those pre-measured packets, have a variety of flavors and roasts, etc. It’s not the best coffee, but I’m not complaining about free. 

We typically have 3-4 carafes out at once, each with a different roast and we leave the empty coffee bag in front to indicate what’s inside. I have my preference but will drink almost any of them. The thing is, the VAST majority of people making coffee will only use one packet when, if you read the instructions and apply a tad bit of common sense, you should actually use two. I thought it was just awful coffee for short while before I discovered most people just used one packet. 

So, when I come in to get coffee, there is almost always an empty carafe, and I will take that one and brew coffee the correct way. I leave both bags out in front of the carrafe to indicate that it’s a stronger coffee so no one is taken by surprise. 

The thing is, every so often, maybe one out of 10-12 times, all carafes are pretty much full, so I will take one and dump out the weak coffee, and replace it with the coffee I made. There are 300 of us drinking this coffee, so we go through a lot, so in my mind one dumped carafe isn’t that much of a waste, especially since they made it with only one bag.

AITA for wasting bad coffee?

Now in this last week two family members suddenly have all these things they want done before I leave! Putting together furniture, getting my moving truck earlier so they can use it to pick stuff up from a department store, and clearing out one of their basements. I pretty much flat out refused to do any of it. It got brought up at Thanksgiving and I got made out to look like the bad guy!  It's a pet peeve of mine in the first place when people try and tack things onto my plans (hey since you're going that way, would you mind going by here since it's nearby etc).

I have stated multiple times to her whenever we go there that I absolutely despise that place, but I continue to go whenever she wants to. This instance I made it apparent just how much i disliked Olive Garden, and suggested that we find a compromise restaurant or try a different Italian place. She refuses to go anywhere else or try anything I suggest. I was upset, and was in a bad mood for a while, so she suggested that she could just order something off their to-go menu and eat it at home while I get some other food somewhere else. She seemed upset that she couldn't eat inside olive garden, and I feel kinda shitty that it happened on her birthday. AITA?

One of my brothers recorded a video of me doing something which I told him I didn’t want anyone seeing. A few hours later, he tells me he put it up on Instagram for everyone to see. I get angry/upset and tell him to delete it. My Dad starts telling me to calm down and regardless I’m overreacting but I told my brother I didn’t want anyone seeing. Eventually, he does delete the video but looking back on the situation now I’m a bit upset that my Dad didn’t see where I was coming from and is more on brothers side even though he showed a video of me for everyone to see without my permission. I realise he always does this.

Now complete the following example-
input: So this is a leading title that will need some context so you get the full picture. So this happened to my friends and I when I was studying abroad in this European country. Essentially some of our friends from the US were visiting us that week because they were on break for Thanksgiving. 

One night we were walking back from the clubs/bars between 3am-4am when these group of local guys started to harass us. It all started because one of my friends who was visiting has a very boisterous laugh and he was laughing past these group of guys at whatever conversation we were having . These locals thought we were laughing at them for whatever reason and started coming  at us, yelling curse words their native language. So they keep yelling and following us and it got to the point where it became to much.  We were being restrained because we were all in a different country where, if the police were ever involved they would most likely take the side of the locals. For the record before this we were mugged at knife point in a different city in this country.

Then the moment when we knew it was “serious” was when they all TOOK OF THEIR BELTS( I shit you not) and started swing them at us with the buckle end .We were so confused because we NEVER saw something like that. At that point it was flight or fight and we chose fight. We all ended up fighting, however my friends and I handled ourselves well. Once it was all over not was knocked out or seriously hurt it was your normal drunken fight. However in the end we had no problem handling them because they were smaller than we were, you could say we “won”. The caveat is, they were clearly under the age of 18. I would put them in the range of 16-17, however in this particular country they are allowed to drink and be out.

Are we assholes for fighting these kids? For reference we were all aged 19-21.

input: So I was in a fast food drive through line and I had just ordered. There were also several other people waiting to order behind me and it seemed like the person in front of me wasn’t paying any attention. The line moved and I waited longer than I feel I should have to hit my horn just to get the person to move forward so the person behind me could order. He started yelling incoherent words at me (both our windows were down) and, while I tried my best to stifle it, I chuckled a bit. He did not like that. He jumped out of his car and started angrily storming toward me. I didn’t think he would do anything, but I put my window up for good measure. The man came right up next to my window to yell more incoherent words then stomped back to his car. He then turned around and yelled a few more things, then got into his car and moved forward. It all happened pretty quickly, within what felt like about 15 seconds, but by the time he was done the line had moved forward for a second time.

So, should I not have honked at this guy? Was I wrong to? I thought that’s kind of what horns were for. Anyway, AITA?

input: So during my high school English clash we were discussing Frankenstein in a giant circle that she called a “debate” where ideas would go thrown around and people would respond with their thoughts. The rules of the discussion were that things discussed had to relate to the book and to stay on topic.  About halfway through the question got popped that was, “If someone grows up in a negative environment are they going to be a negative or destructive person?”  So the normal thing was happening with people going back on forth and then this girl, we will call her Alex speaks out and says, “ Well it’s like saying that a young girl grows up where her father gets killed in a car crash and then her mother remarried a man who was a pedophile who raped her even though she was around 6 and then the step son that came with her would emotionally abuse her and touch her sexually and the father would beat her if she tried to speak out.” Now she continued on about comparing it to Frankenstein but it was in that moment of her talking that I cracked a fairly loud chuckle and I put my head down to laugh and because I was getting awful looks from other students and the teacher looked upset with me. I as a person have a very dark sense of humor and just the sheer randomness of her bringing up that kind of event out of the blue when we were talking about Frankenstein caused me to lose it. I had a couple friends in the class who also share my sense of humor and they all were also trying to contain their laughter I just let mine come out because I was so shocked.

input: In the beginning of January I organized a social gathering at my flat to play a few board games and play some video games at the end of the month.
There would of been about 12 people in total but a few didn’t reply so maybe about 9 said they were coming.

Day comes. I get a cancellation in the morning due to a friends brother passing out meaning 2 people wouldn’t be coming the two people were a relationship). I felt this was understandable. 

I texted another friend to see if him and his girlfriend were coming they originally said they were. Didn’t get a reply.

Then I texted another friend who said he was coming not just once but twice, on the day I first organized the gathering and a few days later.

He didn’t reply till about 2 hours before my gathering was about to happen (on a Sunday at about 18:00) He told me he had work to do.

At this point ill admit I got a little annoyed only two people were now coming to something I organized a few weeks beforehand. So I kinda just went out at the last minute friend.  I told it it was a f*cking piss take that people have no communication. I had also spent a bit of money on this event I bought like 6 other controllers and some food and drink.

I told him why didn’t he just text me earlier at least. I mean if you have work (he works as Tech support and no he doesn’t have to drop everything if he gets a call) they tend to give you  plenty of notice to come in.

A few hours later his wife (they married quite young and they even have a kid) telling me how dare I speak to last minute friend like that. And basically told me she won’t be inviting me to any future events. I had calmed down a little by then and I did eventually apologize to the guy but I don’t think I was particularly that harsh on him. I did still say I think I had enough reason to be a little annoyed at people. Anyway his wife’s basically kicked me out of the friendship group and blocked me on social media.

Oh and I did eventually get a text from another friend who originally said they could make it (he would have brought his girlfriend as well).

He told me he was at work. This was at 11pm....

I decided not to reply to him Incase of any other future drama. But I think he knows I’m pissed off with him as well.

Anyway do you guys think IATA?

input: I'm an atheist living in a deeply religious country. Half my family is catholic and half is evangelical christian. And of course they have weddings, baptisms, christmas, funerals, etc. But I just can't bring myself to go to these events anymore. It's draining and makes me feel uncomfortable to basically support their beliefs that have caused so much harm to people around the world. The state of organized religion is so dire and I feel they have too much power in my region, messing with the government and working overtime to limit civil liberties of women, minorities and LGBT people. In the past I have attended these events, but it has grown more and more difficult to do it. 

To give you an example, at my sister's wedding the pastor spent half the sermon (or whatever it's called) raging against same-sex marriage. And I'm gay. And this happens in almost every of these events: I don't know how they do it but they are able to bring it up. I'm also pro-choice; and of course they are not. Thousands of women have been forced to carry their child after being raped because of the religious influence in the government and the strict abortion laws that we have. That's without mentioning the circle of pedophilia, the belief that I'm a complete sinner and the overall atmosphere of oppression I feel. 

Of course I'd like to be there for special family gatherings. And I will go to the dinner, party or whatever after it (and usually they are alcohol-free since evangelical christians don't believe in drinking (or dancing!). So, am I the asshole? I'm conflicted. 

Tl,dr: I'm a (gay) atheist in the middle of a huge religious family and attending their religious events has  become too uncomfortable; so I have told them I won't attend anymore.

input: Sort of an update to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/apcb7t/wibta_if_i_tell_staff_my_roommatefriend_cut/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) post, but it's also an AITA question.

So to recap: I am in a program that helps adults with autism gain independence. This program provides housing, and we each have one roommate (so 6 people in 3 apartments). Staff come in all the time to work with us with a set amount of hours before they leave in the evening.

Mike (the person I mentioned in the last post and the resident asshole) hasn't been kicked out, unfortunately. He is still discharged, but apparently he has 3 months to find a new place to live. In the meantime, he has to stay here, and according to one of the staff, we have to ""be civil"" with him.

However, my roommate's idea of ""being civil"" means inviting him into our apartment, hanging out with him more and more often, and being nice to him. She claims that when he leaves she's done with him, but I don't believe it.

Needless to say, apart from when he called me a ""lazy fatass"" (multiple times, despite me not being super-lazy in the slightest), I view him as an irredeemable asshole and an annoying little prick, like a bug you can't pick off your skin. He's obnoxious, pompous, and is generally, well, annoying and loud.

I will still greet him with ""hi"" and maybe a ""how are you"" and I'll still say ""nice"" in response to whatever he says, but I am in no way friends with him. This is my way of ""being civil"". However, when my roommate invites him over, I end up going to my room to get away from him, and when someone tells me my roommate is with him I go, ""Of course she's with Mike."" While rolling my eyes.

I understand my roommate can deal with him how she pleases, but am I the asshole for not being more nice to Mike?

Now complete the following example-
input: My Mother  recently asked me (m21) if I could contribute half of the cost for her and my sisters (16) move.

&amp;#x200B;

My Father had divorced her and she could stay in the House until my sister turned 18 but they decided to move out earlier because it's way too expensive to pay for the big house if only two people live in it.

My Sister and I could be called ""Hedge-Fund Kids"" since, once we turn 18, we get access to a depot of Stocks worth quite a bit of Money. My Mom got something similar in the divorce but with less value (but still plenty, you could call it a Hedge-Fund^(light))

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I don't like spending all this Money for useless stuff and prefer to pay my University Bills and have the rest for Emergencies or if I have an unforeseen expense. I do use the interest that is generated for an occasional treat, but nothing too fancy as I feel like it isn't necessary to spend a lot of money to enjoy a vacation or get a good meal.

&amp;#x200B;

She painted me a rather bleak picture of her financial future where she told me she wouldn't have enough money left to retire and didn't want to chip away at her funds too much and that's why she needed 5000€ from me or my sister. I told her I would give her the money since I didn't want my sister to already lose money before she had control over it.

Then today, she told me she wanted to go to Machu Picchu (from Germany) to see some Guy give an Ufology Seminar at the ruins. This was the following Interaction:

&amp;#x200B;

Mom: (excitedly) I'm thinking of going to Machu Picchu in May! Wouldn't that be great? There is this brasilian (My Mom is brasilian and came to Germany almost 30 Years ago) Youtuber that is going to explain stuff about the ruins from a historic and ufologic standpoint

&amp;#x200B;

Me (carefully) : Didn't you ask me for Money just last week? I feel weird giving you Money if you have enough to pay flights to Peru and back... (let alone for some bullshit seminar, I thought)

&amp;#x200B;

Mom: Always with the Money! Forget about it! I'm just going to take the Money for the move out of my own funds!

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I'm just a little confused why you asked me in the first place...

&amp;#x200B;

Mom: (sighs sadly) some day I will find people that are excited for me...

&amp;#x200B;

And then I left, feeling bad for questioning my Moms financial choices and wondering if I was the Asshole in this Situation. I mean I got enough Money, but at the same time, she seems to have enough too. What do you guys think?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My Mom wanted Money from me after painting me a bleak picture of her financial future and I questioned her financial choices after she brought up that she was planning an expensive trip resulting in me not giving her Money.

&amp;#x200B;

excuse the capitalization errors, I get confused between german and english sometimes.

input: (Please tell me if i'm doing something wrong - I am new to Reddit and i'm also on mobile, so formatting may be weird)

So, a couple of years ago, I was attending this summercamp. I was about 11-12  years old. 

Anyways, the first day of summercamp, I arrived and everything seemed normal. One thing that didn't seem right was this one kid, who held the door open, but always stared at me as I walked past with my friend. 

Near the end of the day, he moved to sit next to me during an activity, and I was a bit uncomfortable. He had been giving me weird looks all day, and trying to get close to me. 

He then asks me to be his girlfriend (I have never spoken to him before this, besides ""thank you"") and I sorta freak out. We were in a public place, with other kids around. I explain to him, as calmly as I could, that I wasn't ready for a relationship. (Please note, he didn't know my name. I didn't know his either)

Although he seemed a bit upset, he said ok, and that he wouldn't ask again. 

That was a lie - 

He asked me THREE more times over the next 2 to 3 weeks, constantly trying to get near me and asking me if I had though about it and wanted to be his girlfriend. 

Eventually, I had enough, and told my friend to tell him that I had a boyfriend so he would leave me alone (I know, that's childish, but I was young and quite honestly, creeped out. I also felt bad, because he had hinted that he had a mental illness of some sort and I wasn't sure what to do).

Later, he confronted me about it, claiming that I had told him 'I wasn't ready for a relationship' and stuff. Knowing I had been caught, I stuttered something, before practically running away. 

I stopped attending (not because of him, but moreso because my parents could no longer afford the camp), and when I returned the last couple weeks of Summercamp, I found out that he had stopped going when he figured out I wasn't going either. 

But I want to know - was I the asshole for doing that? Rejecting him and telling him I had a boyfriend besudes the fact that he was intellectually disabled?

Now complete the following example-
input: Bit of a long story, we never officially dated because when we met we were studying abroad together and she had a boyfriend back in her home country. By the end of our time abroad we'd pretty much been a couple for several months in terms of how things were when we were alone together. When we were around friends though it changed and everything had to be kept a secret, which took a significant toll on my mental health. 

After our time abroad she broke up with her boyfriend and went back to her home country in Europe and I went back to Australia. She didn't want a label but she wanted me to come visit her around my exam time and when I told her I couldn't she got nasty saying that I would never achieve any of my goals because I couldn't follow through with little things like travelling to see her. This was one criticism amongst many that she had including criticising my choice of engineering discipline because it showed disregard for the environment, as well as for the political affiliations of my friends, not being vegetarian and a few other things.

The constant criticism hurt me, I felt very depressed at this point, a lot due to me not re-adjusting to life at home after my year abroad, but the relationship didn't help either. Before she met me there was another guy she had feelings for who left because of her boyfriend. Hearing that she was then single, he came back into her life and they started travelling together and I felt very uncomfortable with it, and despite the fact she promised that it was me she wanted, I didn't feel I could trust her. This was the point where I had enough and I stopped responding to a lot of her messages. She ramped up the scale of the abusive messages she'd send and at times she'd hit a nerve and I'd respond. 

For about 6 months this carried on until she called me out for being an asshole who didn't ever care for her and was too immature to hold down a relationship. I did know that she was also struggling with depression as much as I was, but I felt so much better not talking to her so I just couldn't bring myself to respond, or really communicate that to her. I know I should've tried explaining that to her but I found it too difficult at the time. 

When I finally got around to explaining that I left because she was hurting me, and apologised for not communicating or ending it in the healthiest way, she told me that I was just trying to make myself out to be a good person when I'm not by apologising and didn't believe I was genuinely sorry. She believes that me handling breaking it off by not responding to messages was much more harmful than anything she ever did to me and that I'm the asshole here. I find it hard to objectively view this situation, please help me Reddit.

I live away these days so I haven't really been around for the organisation/discussions about the holiday or celebrations and so I didn't realise that as midnight hit on the eve of the birthday, the others appeared with presents for said birthday friend, but I didn't. 

I apologised and said ""I'm sorry I didn't realise we were doing presents"" which got a response from of ""We'll obviously! It's their birthday!"" from the s/o with nobody disagreeing.

This is the first one of these we've done together, they're the first one to reach a significant milestone since we've become friends, and as I said above, I wasn't around for any planning since I now live away.

Now, none of us are particularly well off, all quite young, either not long out of uni, and/or not in a reasonably paid job, and so I assumed each of us spending upwards of £200 on the holiday was enough of a gift.

I'm genuinely curious, AITA here for not buying a present? Was it rude of them to respond in such a way? Or even, am I looking too much into the comment?

Recently (4 months ago) for the first time in my life a girl actually likes me!
She striked the conversation first too!
So its been time, we havent ever actually met but being my first time in some kind of a relationship i am attached and i need help, we got into a fight for what seems to me is very immature from her side, i dont know what to do!
It has been 2 days (instagram says 1, maybe because it hasnt been full 48 hours) since the last time i talked to her and im sad and absolutely becoming put down.

Now the catch is that i have to go to the capital where she lives on a car show and i plan on telling her so she can come and we can meet up, but my friend says its a bad idea and i should just send a selfie to her when im there and tell her ""guess who is in your hometown""
But if i do that she might not be able to come because of her things she has to do, so i plan on messaging her in friday and telling her about the trip to her town so she can prepare for us to meet
We are fresh in this argument and we havent spoken since monday
I feel terrible, am i the asshole? what could i possibly do to not look desperate or not to ruin anything ?

Now complete the following example-
input: So, I guess I'll start off with background information. I am 21, and transmasculine, or female to male if that term works for you. I have known since I was 15, though was unable to act on it until I moved several hours away, about three years ago. A couple months after I moved, I started medically transitioning, but had some mental health issues, so I stopped for about a year, and have since been medically transitioning again for a year. Now, I've been fully socially transitioned in my life for almost a year at this point, which is pretty easy with my family so far away. I'm what we have termed ""stealth"". I'm seen fully as male, and nobody knows I'm trans other than my closest friends who have been around me for over a year. It's a very small part of me I like to keep to myself. 

My parents, well, I don't have a great relationship with them. I really do love my mom, she raised me on her own after she seperated from my alcoholic father. She gave me as much as she could when I was younger. But she can be a bit... Narcissistic. She has those tendencies. She takes everything positive, and turns it negative. But she does genuinely love me, and since I live so far away now, our relationship is better, since she cannot control my life as much as she used to.

And she does deserve to know these things about her child. But I'm so terrified of her reaction. Even after all these changes, and meeting several trans people, she still doesn't see it. She still talks about how weird trans people are. My stepdad has said some questionably homophobic things to me as well, assuming I'm a lesbian. They're not great with this, and I genuinely don't know if this would get better with me helping them forward. It feels like I'm coming close to having to seperate myself even more from them, especially after I tell them. 

To the point of the question: there's a fairly large chance I could get top surgery within a year. This is something that is very important to me, and my physical health. I've been wearing what's called a binder, and they are... Somewhat dangerous. They're basically a compression top that goes over your chest. I've been wearing it for 6 years at this point, 7 days a week, for about 8 to 16 hours a day, and it's caught up to me. Back issues, serious shoulder pain. I can't exercise with it on, as that's dangerous, but at the same time, I can't leave the house without it on, for obvious reasons and my own personal mental health. 

I personally think I would absolutely be the asshole, but I don't know if that's my mom talking inside of me. My friends have told me I should just go and do it without telling my family, and I don't know if that's right. I didn't want to post this on a trans forum, because I'd be getting trans related experiences. I already know their answers. I can absolutely give more information if this is not enough. I just am seeking an outside opinion on the matter.

Now complete the following example-
input: Hi all!

Using an alt account. My GF and I have been together for the better part of two years. I adore her with all I am, and love her from top to toe. Except for when she is out drinking. I am 24 and she is 23, and we're both from Norway. Before proceeding to read this, understand that Norwegian drinking culture is a little different from many other countries, and we tend to drink only on weekends, but many go out with the goal in mind of getting completely wasted.

Now, my GF isn't necessarily out with a goal of becoming as drunk as possible, but her body seems to be extremely susceptible to mixing alcohol. What is the sweetest person alive becomes this absolute messwhen she drinks, and it is insanely tiring for me. It's usually one of two scenarios: We go out together with friends, and I can't enjoy myself or the people around me at all, because I feel chained to her in case she pops into toddler mode and starts doing irrational stuff, or I am home (not a huge fan of going out), and she ends up calling me, making me come and get her, if she even is at the place she told me she'd be.  
Right now it's 4:30 am, and I'm losing my shit. She went out today for a birthday, leaving with the promise of ""Yes, I'll take it easy tonight"", only to still be out there somewhere. Luckily I have Snapchat, and I can check the map if I'm scared she's somewhere she shouldn't be, and to look at mystories. She's recently become ""friends"" with a gang I absolutely despise. They drink what seems like 3-4 days a week, and do loads of coke. She hasn't tried that yet, as she explains that she doesn't want anything to do with that. She is there right now at an after party. Went there once myself, never going back. Absolutely putrid place.

Anyway, this Friday, she also went out. That evening some of my friends came over to our new apartment, to hang out, drink a few beers, and play some Smash Bros. Of course, around 1 am I receive a call from her, where she has no idea where she is, and I tell her that it's probably better if she comes home. She then proceeds to get in a taxi, call me on facetime by accident, hang up, and call again a few minutes later. She says that she's here. I go out to look, and she is nowhere to be found. Apparently, she'd given the cab driver the general area rather than the address, and she is 500 meters down the road, I scurry down to find her, and I carry her home while she's half asleep on my shoulders. I'm slightly irritated now, as she's pulled me away from my friends yet again (this has happened numerous times before). When we get back to our place, I'm just a little down, cause she keeps doing this, and my friends probably noticed too.

Like, some nights she's fine, and comes home okay, usually when she hasn't mixed wine, beer, Jägermeister, Fireball and vodka, and that's completely fine. I want her to have fun, but not on my expense. I'm a very busy guy too. I have work, studies, and a very demanding position in our student union, so I really can't get enough down time, and she knows this all too well. She also keeps saying things like ""I don't know how I got so drunk"" and ""It's not my fault"", and the such. It's not like she becomes aggressive or anything, but she has gotten into serious trouble whilst drunk before. It's more like you try your hardest to communicate with her, but it's like she's a demented three year old. In other words: Absolutely impossible. I don't think she'll ever do anything drastic or life threatening, but I just still can't shake this subsisting feeling of unease. Like a constant heart rate of 120.

Bottom line is, am I the asshole here for wanting her to drink more responsibly? I feel like this feeling of responsibility from my side is eating me up. I hate that she hangs out with loud assholes that does cocaine, and won't give a second thought to their studies or ambitions, and I hate that I can't sleep or relax because I know that my phone is doomed to ring any second and I'll need to come and rescue her. On the other hand I feel like this is controlling of me, and has something to do with jealousy. I want her to live her life the way she sees fit, but at the same time, I need her to understand that I can't keep sitting around being worried. It's 4:30 am, and I'm leaving for a flight to a neighboring city at 08:25 tomorrow, and I am not getting any sleep tonight. I'm just so tired of all this, and I'm nearing despair. I'm really conflicted, and would love some advice.

input: Here goes nothing. 

I’m a 25f working a retail job where there’s a LOT of people employed. SO many people that I feel I’m meeting new people everyday and also forgetting someone exists for months. I’m the kind of friendly that will chat and laugh with anyone, honestly. 

From stage right enters Paul. I’ve known Paul since day one at this job. But six months in, we finally get to talk more than a quick hello and goodbye. And Paul? Is a fucking nerd. Just. Like. Me. 

We are VIBING. We’re cackling and hollering. We like the same fandoms, the same genres, we like the same kind of TEA. So we become buddies, right? 

We go for food, chat about geek shit. We go see a geek movie. I meet his geek friends. We keyboard smash to each other, it’s great. And this is over the course of, let’s say, 3 months. I decided to get him a teeny gift cause I’d thought he’d like it. He decided to get ME a little gift cause he’d thought I’d like it. 

He legit looked me in the eyes and said “you’re cool people. I like you. I wanted you to know that.” And I said, “hey man. I like you too. It’s nice to know cool people like you exist.” 

Everything seemed kosher until I got an actual letter from him that said he wanted to spend his future with me. 

And I’m mortified. Because, remember I said I worked in a big store where I meet new people and forget about people? It’s hard to keep track of everybody right? Which I didn’t realize might be the case. 

Because, people of reddit, I am a 25f who is a LESBIAN. And I don’t know how to handle myself in the face of what may have been a long term heterosexual courting that I did not recognize because I naively thought men and women could be platonic friends??? 

AM I THE ASSHOLE? For not realizing what it meant? Did I lead Paul on? I haven’t even responded to their letter because I can’t handle myself? I honestly feel so embarrassed and there’s a little voice in my head that’s telling me I’m a whore and that it was my fault. 

I don’t think he’s a homophobe or that I’ll be in danger if I come out to him. But I’m MORTIFIED. I’m not someone who can easily hurt someone’s feelings, but I’m clearly doing that here by ignoring it.

Anyway even though it winds her up we kept doing it because we thought she was actually cool with it and she gives as she gets so it's fine. Then one day we're watching Supergirl and the lesbian character comes on screen so we joke that she's her role model and ask if she's going to get a haircut like that (Literally not even saying anything too bad) and she way overreacts and leaves, then some of her other friends come for us and say we should stop saying that when she's asked us to stop but we didn't realize she was serious we thought she was just going along with it like when we all make fun of each other.

I'm pretty sure i'm not the asshole here and she's just overreacting but I want to get you guys opinion god even reading this is embarrassing it's such dumb petty shit and it's become a way bigger deal than it should be.

Now complete the following example-
input: This has been on my mind, and I need to hear the internet's judgement to see if I'm in the wrong.



I have been job hunting a lot. A few months back, against my better wishes, I gave my information to a recruiting agency. I'm not a fan of them, as you end up with a lot of ""please pass this information along"", but I figured the extra job opportunities couldn't hurt. They eventually found a company I thought I'd love.

Two phone interviews later, they want to see me in person. I'm ecstatic. I'd love to work for this company. My agency has sent me their health benefits earlier, though no other information. I ask what their PTO (paid time off) and 401k information is, and they give it to me after verifying it is accurate. At this point, I am going to meet in person, and note that their benefits aren't great. But I still have no clue what the pay is. I fly out to meet the company with a ticket paid by the potential employer and it seems promising. I think I'd be a great fit for their company.

I get the job offer. I am understandable on the pay; its good, and I am not against it. However I couldn't overlook the benefits. More expensive healthcare, a considerably smaller company match than my current 401k (match doesn't even start until after a year of employment), and a whole week less of PTO (two weeks less the first year of employment). I turn down the offer stating the reasons.



Time for my judgement. Note that I have only been in touch with the recruiter, as I have no contact information of the company. I tell the recruiter why I'm turning it down as stated above.

""[plasmafire117], let me ask you this... Why would you spend the company's money on flying you out there, and then turn it down, if the benefits were going to be the reason you rejected? You knew about them before going to see them.""

I tell him I knew the benefits, sure, but he had only given me health. I had to ask for the other two (PTO\401k), and a that point plans had been made.

""But you never asked for those sooner.""

I tell him that I had no way of knowing until an offer was put. I'd take lower benefits for higher pay, so I'd have taken it. But I know they are already offering me on the high end, and can't change benefits! How could I have known until an offer was made?

He continued to berate me for a bit on how I wasted his time and the company's money... slightly mad at how he responded, I told him to remove my information from his agency. I wanted nothing to do with them after that interaction. I then told him to have a nice day and hung up.



So... judge me. AITA for going on this trip and 'spending their money'? Am I in the wrong? I can't stop thinking about it. I feel bad sure, because I really felt this company would be great. But with a family and the benefits, I couldn't overlook how much less we would get. Should I have canceled the trip? Should I even be thinking about this so much?

Now complete the following example-
input: I've casually dated this girl some time back. I was 17 she was 19, she lived a 45 minute drive from me/1 hour train. We went out for half a year, but i was gone all summer, so we maybe saw each other 9 times in total. Recently we argued more and more because i was always pushing for affection, like for her to be sweeter through the phone or just be calm and laugh, and she just sort of took all of my jokes seriously. Whenever i made specific examples, she just said she was showing me she liked me in her own ways. Shes a shyboi so i just said whatever, blow it off.

I always make myself available to hang out but she was working full time and had some courses in school. she'd never really push to set up a day that works, she would find out what was happening, and if it was a carnival in town or a Zabawa (polish party where everyone just drinks and dances? i don't know how to translate that one) then she'd say yes, otherwise if it wasn't anything special she would usually say no.

Eventually she said she admitted she wasn't being as affectionate as she could be because shes introverted and the only way she will open up is once we date, which she'll be ready to once her life ""calms down"" and she's accepted into uni (she took 2 gap years to save up and improve marks). Ok, so if she basically wants FWB, who am i to deny.

Nearing the end, everytime we talked she'd fight me on small stuff, and i wouldn't respond well because her anger over small things would fuel my want to antagonize her. We took a couple of days of rest, once we started talking again we argued again and she said ""I don't think a friends with benefits relationship will benefit either of us"", so i stopped calling her and responding, because i don't want to remain friends. We're over right? She doesn't get to be apart of my life anymore.  
She says i'm an asshole and was just friends with her to hook up, i don't think we hung out a single time without fucking at some point. But i dont think im the asshole because i pushed for more than just this casual shit, but now that it's gone i don't think it'd be beneficial for me talk to her or interact with her at all. She thought removing sex from the equation would fix everything

  
Which got me to think, i've never remained friends with anyone I'd rather date. I don't ask every single girl i know out. I have a couple that are cool people and i enjoy talking to, but I only have really pushed myself to be with girls I'd want a relationship with. Sometimes it would work out, sometimes it wouldn't, but i would never remain friends with them. A littttttttle bit because i was hurt, but mostly because the only reason i started talking to them was with that intention, so once i saw that it wasn't going to go further, and they weren't anything special to talk to, i would respond if they messaged me, but i would stop being the one that called and texted them first.

Now complete the following example-
input: As a preface, I’m not sure if this would even qualify, since I’m pretty sure I already am an asshole. I’m looking for an objective set of eyes on the situation. Also, sorry for the formatting, I’m on mobile. 

We’ll refer to this person as Sam to keep genders/identities as hidden as possible. 

So, I’ve had a problem with Sam, but I can’t remove him/her from my life because he/she is my SO’s cousin, and they’ve been close since birth. 

The story begins here: when my SO and I began our relationship, Sam was jealous that SO was in a relationship and he/she wasn’t, so he/she badmouthed me to my SO all of the time. Sam turned out to be so effective at turning my SO against me that we ended up breaking up for about a year. 

Then, during junior year prom (I’m a whiny teen, as it turns out), Sam was again jealous because the person that he/she wanted to go with went with someone else, and was in a general bad mood. My SO and I were talking again, and as I tried to make my way over to SO to dance, Sam got in my way over and over so I couldn’t. Then, another person went and danced with my SO. I was upset the rest of the night. 

However, since then, I’ve reconnected with my SO and we have been dating for a while, and Sam has found him/herself a SO. Thus, I’ve had to spend most of this year of school around Sam+SO. 

This exposure has lead to nothing but constant roast sessions between myself and Sam; Sam will call me scrawny while I will rip on Sam for the stupid things that he/she says. 

This all culminates in the study session in the library today. Sam had been laughing at me for something that he/she wouldn’t even tell me about, and I was quite annoyed about it. So, my asshole move reared its head. I took a book about fitness off of the shelf and told Sam that he/she should read through it. Keep in mind, Sam certainly isn’t a fat or anything like that, Sam is just slightly on the larger side. Major dick move, I get it. 

Then, as I was trying to fall asleep Sam’s SO decides to text me, demonstrating how upset he/she is, lambasting my morals, threatening to kick my ass, and demanding an apology. 

I apologized for what I said, but the entire conversation was tinged by the impression that Sam’s SO believes that he/she did nothing wrong and I was the criminal, which I couldn’t take. I believe that if Sam would insult me about my body (being scrawny), Sam should be able to take an insult about his/hers. 


I get it, Sam is probably self-conscious about his/her body, but I just can’t understand how someone could think that my insult was completely unprompted and “over the line”. Sam has no right at all to assume that it’s okay to make fun of my scrawniness, and shouldn’t be surprised when he/she gets a taste of his/her own medicine. 

So the question is, am I the only asshole in this situation, are we both, or are we just a bunch of whiny teenagers still trying to figure out life?

Now complete the following example-
input: Hello Reddit! I wanted to keep it short, but silly old me just couldn't do that apparently. 

Little background information: I am 18 years old. Since around a year and a half I've been tutoring both chemistry and mathematics to classmates/fellow students as a part time job. I live in the Netherlands where from the ages 12 - 18 (ish) you would do either a VMBO, HAVO or VWO course/program (to make it really simple, VMBO is considered 'the easiest' and VWO is considered 'the most difficult' when in actuality it's a little more complex that just 'easiest' and 'most difficult'). I got my HAVO diploma a year and a half ago, and I've been in the VWO program since then and my plan is to go to university afterwards. For my central exams on the HAVO for chemistry I got an 8.9/10 and for mathematics I got an 9.3/10, this is when I got inspired to help/tutor other people (I've done it before the exams but less thorough/during class). 

Last july I signed myself up for a tutoring service, where both students and tutor can find eachother for a chosen subject they need help with. But since I signed myself up last july, I haven't gotten any students from them yet: no big deal, I suspect around may/april 2019 they'll come because the central exams are getting closer. I do still have students from my old school (where I am also listed as a tutor) and my mother is a teacher (music) and sometimes has students for me.

Now onto last week: I got an e-mail that in my area there was a new student available, I figured I'd check out what he needed help with (students need to list that to make sure the tutor can prepare accordingly). It stated that the student was a 52 year old man that was taking the HAVO central exam may of next year, and needed help working with the graphic calculator (the classic TI-84 from texas instruments) and general help with mathematics for around 4 hours/week. I immedeatly wanted to decline the student, because I really am not comfortable going to this man's house to tutor him, even though he really needs help with the calculator. I think it's really inspiring that even though he's 52 he's willing to take the central exam and get his HAVO diploma. I waited about a week and got another e-mail (these are automatically generated btw, he did not send me the e-mail directly) and instead of leaving it be, I clicked on the ""permanently decline"" button. 

Mind you I've never seen this man/spoken to him in person, but the sheer fact he was 52 really caught me off guard and pushed me to say no to tutoring him. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, am I the asshole for not wanting to tutor this man?

Now complete the following example-
input: So my ex-friend and I were in a band together. All of the members have been great friends for a long time. This particular friend (we'll call him Richard) though had OCD and EVERYTHING about weed freaked him out. If he smelled weed it would get him panic attacks and was actually a problem for us when playing shows but we managed. 

Well I did acid and mushrooms at a party and had a bad trip and went to the hospital (that's a story for another time). It freaked me out BAD and I quit everything drug related. I only did mushrooms and acid occasionally and smoked pot regularly. Me quitting of course made Richard happy and more comfortable to be around me although we already hung out literally almost every day. 

I never quit smoking for Richard, I did it for me. When I felt like I was ready to smoke again I didnt tell my friends because they expected me not to smoke anymore. When I finally made it clear I wanted to smoke again to my friends (I didnt start smoking at this point because I wanted to talk to them first) they were very upset, especially Richard. Well I didnt think it was a big deal I wanted to smoke again especially since our bassist (Richard's cousin) was allowed to smoke. Richard didnt want me smoking because him and I spent more time together although I would never smoke around him, before we hung out, and never even brought the stench of it near him. Which is a bit reasonable I guess but we practiced every or every other day and Richard's cousin came to practice obviously stoned nearly every day. Everybody knew and nobody cared, not even Richard.

After Richard told me I wasnt allowed to smoke I didnt for some time but it was just driving me crazy. After awhile I felt my best option was to just go over his head and smoke behind his back. That's exactly what I did for awhile and one day I stupidly and carelessly smoked in my van. The next day the band and I had a show and when they went to open my doors the stench of weed washed out and they knew immediately. 

Well they and especially Richard were pissed at me, they were even sneak dissing me on their snapchat stories while I was driving us to our gig. This basically ruined our friendship and through time things deteriorated. I quit smoking weed a little after they figured out because it was the only way I could stay in the band and as much as i was becoming to resent them i still loved the band.

Quitting really only prolonged what was inevitable, our relationships never completely restored. We still resented each other and we just fought more and more about everything. Before we knew it I was out of the band and they continued without me

Now complete the following example-
input: Bit of a backstory, I am adopted. My adopted parents are amazing and I have been their kid all my life. I’ve never known another family. I do have contact with my bio mom, but don’t talk to her for various reasons.  My parents also have 4 bio children (my brothers and sisters) who are younger than me. 

So my grandparents were over a couple of weeks ago, they are your usual conservative rednecks. The visit was fine until I got up one morning. I went to the kitchen to make myself some breakfast before heading to
School (I am a university student). My grandparents were in the kitchen. We said good morning to each other, I asked if they wanted anything to eat. They decline. Normal boring morning. 

Then my grandma asks “so how’s your real mom doing” 

I am confused at the question, and tell them that she should be home soon, you can ask her then. My grandma corrects herself “no your real mum, the one who gave birth to you” 

“You mean my bio mother” 

My grandma nods.

“Well I don’t talk to her so I don’t know. And for the record she isn’t my real mum, your daughter is” 

The two don’t apologize for the mistake and try to brush it off as them being old (my grandpa is only in his early 70’s, not that old in his family)

Normally I would chalk this up to them being old and not up with the times but my grandpa has a sister who adopted 2 kids in the early 70’s. he and my grandma are well aware about adoption and terminology and all that Jazz. 

And I have always suspected that they don’t see my as one of the grandkids. I was venting to a friend about this and they said I should just let it go and not be mad at my grandparents. 

Of course I will always love them, but I feel I have a right to me mad at this. I’m nearly 19. I have tried to talk to them and they just change the subject instead. 

So AITA? Should I just try and let it go?

Now complete the following example-
input: Some background: I have known ""Amy"" and ""Trey"" since middle school. We've never really been friends but we've still kept in contact over the years from mutual friends and get togethers. Trey is roommates with some of my good friends so I see him a lot more often than Amy but she stays at his house during weekends semi frequently, but I've never really spoken to them beyond pleasantries and light conversation, except for one time a few years ago when I got really drunk and came on to Trey but he denied me because he had just started dating Amy (which i was unaware of because we aren't really close). Amy heard about it but she wasn't mad because she knew the fact that they were dating hadn't gotten to me yet.

&amp;#x200B;

About two months ago, I went to a get together at Treys house and Amy was away visiting family. As things started winding down and my friends went to bed, I sat down in the kitchen and started playing with the dog. Trey then sat down next to me and started playing with the dog too. He then came right out and asked me if I wanted to go to his room and suck his dick. I was pretty shocked and only really managed a polite ""no"" and then Trey went to bed without pushing it and I left and went home. 

I didn't want to tell Amy for a few reasons. First one being when I came on to him while they started dating awhile ago and I thought she would think I did something to encourage him to say that. I also thought maybe Trey wasn't in his right mind because he was drinking and smoking all night and I didn't wanna blow up his life over a mistake. And lastly, I don't believe i'm close enough to either of them to get involved in their relationship like that.

Since then I've seen Trey a couple times and everything has been totally normal so I figured he was fucked up and forgot anything happened, while I was feeling guilty for not telling Amy.

Then last week, Trey and I were by ourselves outside smoking and I brought it up. He said he's been waiting for me to say something about it , he apologized profusely and said he wasn't in his right mind. I said that that was what I assumed and I didn't say anything to anyone about it and just ended up forgiving him. His apology seemed really genuine but I usually take things like this at face value.

AITA for not letting Amy know that her boyfriend would have cheated on her with me and could potentially be cheating on her with someone else?

Now complete the following example-
input: Obviously, the title makes this sound lame, and it probably is. Today is Valentine’s Day and my husband (29M) and I (22F) typically just do something really small like dinner and small candy gifts. 

My husband has a history of not getting me any gift at all for things (Christmas, my birthday, our anniversary etc.) because he typically forgets. Sometimes he’ll get me something retroactively, but sometimes he doesn’t. An important detail is that our birthdays, Valentine’s Day, and our anniversary all fall around the same time of year so it is kind of a lot all at once. 

This year we were talking about our birthdays and I said “don’t bother getting me anything.” He argued that he would like to get me something so I said “I want you to make me a nice dinner.” (This is something I have asked him to do for the last 4 holidays and it still hasn’t happened.) He said he would do that. Then I asked about Valentine’s Day and he said “We’re definitely doing something.” 

Today, I arranged to have a bakery make a small personal sized cake, chocolate covered strawberries, and a chocolate heart for him. I got off work an hour early and came home to surprise him with it. He stayed home from work today because he is recovering from a fever and cough, but he was 90% better today and went out for errands. He wasn’t home when I got home, which was strange so I tried calling him. He didn’t answer, so I waited about 15 minutes and called again with a follow up text. No answer. I started to get really worried and called another 3 times in a row and still no answer. 

About 20 minutes later he calls me back and says “I was getting a haircut, but I’m coming home now. Is everything okay?” I said yes and see you soon. 

I thought he would be bringing something back for me for Valentine’s Day. But he came home empty handed, and seemed genuinely surprised that I got him something. I then expressed that I was a little hurt that he didn’t get me anything and his response was “Well, I had planned to get something on the way home but then you called me so many times I thought you were mad I wasn’t home so I just came straight here.” 

To me that feels like a BS excuse and he forgot to get me something. I clearly told him on the phone that everything was good and I was just worried about him not answering for so long. I feel like he’s trying to flip it on me, like it’s my fault he couldn’t get me a gift. 

So I took the chocolate covered strawberries for myself and I’ve been kind of snippy with him tonight when he asks me what I want to do. 

AITA for being upset that he didn’t get me a Valentine’s Day gift?

Now complete the following example-
input: I met my now GF through a mutual friend on this friends birthday. She wanted me to get to know her because she thought we would be a good match despite only knowing me for a short period of time. This girl and I were both pretty drunk when she introduced us. We had a long conversation and got along well, but I had the feeling that she wasn't what I was looking for in a partner. The evening got longer and after a while, we sat down next to each other and talked some more. Eventually, I kissed her even though I knew I had no intention of ever being together with her. Still, we started dating after a while and we are now together for 1.5 years despite that. The reasons which made me think we're not ""meant"" for each other are still ever present but she has some other qualities that made me overlook them. Part of them is she is really sweet and overall just a loving and caring person and we also totally match sexually and have amazing sex. Still,  There a just a couple of things about her that are a dealbreaker for me in the long run. Anyway, now that this relationship is getting more long term I wonder if I should break up, because deep down I know I wouldn't want to marry her or start a ""future"" with her.  I talked to her about it and she says she doesn't care because I am the best thing that ever happened to her and that she doesn't care as long as we are together. Also, we both love each other, but I still think that that is not enough for a long term relationship. 

To further complicate things I'm moving away for college in 2 months to a city that's about a 3h drive away. I don't want to stay there longer than necessary and move back home eventually, but I think that it will be probably 1.5 to 3.5 years before I can move back to my home town. She offered to move with me but I refused because I'm unsure about the relationship in general and I wouldn't want her to make a commitment like that while I'm unsure about our relationship. At the moment we are planning to have a long distance relationship.

So now my questions are:

AITA for dating her in the 1st place?

AITA for staying in this relationship even though I'd want something else long term and I am also preventing her from meeting someone who wants what she wants?

AITA for agreeing to a long distance relationship?

&amp;#x200B;

I am very curious to hear what you guys think and thank you in advance for your answers. English is not my 1st language so I'm sorry if my spelling or grammar is bad.

I'm in my first year of uni and haven't been back home to see my mum since the start of the semester (but will be going back next week and we have weekly video calls. I don't particularly mind the extended family but i limit my appearances to 4 times a year.

Main:

About an hour ago my mother messaged the family (me and my brothers) group chat telling us

&gt;Family fun. Booze and good flowing. Speak later although you are welcome to call via messenger to say hello. Love you xxx

I replied

&gt;?

And the response of

&gt;It's the family pre Christmas party

was received followed by a load of photos.

Now to clarify even if I was invited I would have excused myself claiming studying or work etc and my mother knows this. And i might have also forgotten if i was told in person or over the phone, but I've checked my text messages and there's no mention of anything on there.

In response to this and after consultation with my flatmates, I've decided i will not be having my weekly telephone call with my mother this evening.

So AITA for getting annoyed at (probably) not being invited to a family event even though I wouldn't have gone and as such ghosting my mother?

Now complete the following example-
input: Okay, so it's my birthday today. I turned 26, I've been over the birthday rush for years now, and I'm pretty simple. If my wife wants to make it special, I just want to be able to do whatever I want within reason, maybe go to a restaurant I want to try or just hang around the house and have a few drinks at night. Time with her and the kid is really all I care about, it doesn't really matter if I receive gifts or anything like that. This last Christmas though, she got me these tickets to a beer tasting at a former job, pretty high end event I guess. It was a pretty cool gift, but it's not something I was like dying to go to. Fancy things like that just aren't really up my alley, but the idea of going and tasting a bunch of different beers didn't necessarily hit me the wrong way, I just couldn't shake the feeling that she was way more excited for it than I was. It kinda felt like something that she wanted to do, but it was my Christmas present.

Oh well, I still was cool with going and trying to have fun, and we totally did. I didn't really like any of the beers except for 1 and I ended up sampling it a bunch of times rather than tasting some of the other crazy shit they had there. (everything was aged in liquor barrels so tasted like whiskey, tequila, etc... a strong yuck for me.)

So my wife let me sleep in today, good start, I got up and had some coffee, lounged around for a bit, then she told me to shave and get ready because she had a surprise for me. Already she's displaying signs of her thinking of herself, as I don't really care to be shaven for a night out or anything, that is solely for her own liking. It was a small thing though and she does it all the time so whatever, moving on.

We head out to drop my daughter off at my parents' and she starts driving to our destination after we stop for some coffee. We pull into a plaza and she's looking around for the place, then she starts nodding her head when she sees it. I look up and it's a pottery place, a ""paint your own"" pottery place. I am an artsy person....for music. I don't draw, I don't paint, I've never been good at it, I've never really liked it. She starts saying things like ""this is my surprise so you'd better like it"" and ""we can both pick something out and we can paint each other's item"". At this point I'm just trying to fight the ""please don't make me do this"" thoughts and suck it up. I start walking around the store, looking at the different pieces of pottery they have...coffee cups, mugs, salt and pepper shakers, figurines. I just couldn't. I really didn't want to tell my wife, I'm clenching my coffee cup in both hands because I know I don't want to do this for the next couple hours, and I don't have the slightest idea how to tell her.

So finally she gets the hint that I'm not over-excited like she is and asks me what's wrong. I say, ""Babe, I love you so much. I feel like this is something we would be doing for your birthday..."" which in all fairness is 100% true. This just felt like something she wanted to do. Maybe she really did think that I would enjoy something like that, but I'm literally looking around the store and it's nothing but women and kids and the one guy that was in there with us was there with his own wife and kid and they were clearly there for their child.

She gets kinda somber and we walk out of the store towards the car. Cue the tears. She starts bawling, extremely upset that I didn't want to do it. I just don't even know what I'm supposed to say to her. Slowly over the years it feels like my birthday is just her second birthday and that it's all about her. She just kept saying ""that really hurt my feelings"" and ""I was so excited for this but I guess you just don't want to do it"" all really teary and angrily.

I honestly feel so fucking horrible that I made her upset, I hate to see her cry, it breaks my heart so much. At the same time, I feel super disrespected and like my special day was never supposed to be special for me.

We had made plans to go out to a fancy pizza joint I've wanted to try for a while, but I really just didn't even want to go anywhere if she's just gonna be upset all night, so we went home so our daughter could nap. She said she's gonna run out to get some alcohol and to get me something, so now I'm just sitting in our bedroom alone in the dark typing this.  I feel like my day is completely ruined and I'm officially turned off to celebrating my birthday as an adult in the future. I requested this day off from work, but I don't think I'm gonna request my birthday off anymore. I really just want it to be tomorrow already.

AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: ***Please note:  I am simply asking if I’m the asshole for how I handled things, NOT if my BF is the asshole***

My BF (36M) and I (38F) have been together over 4 years, and friends 12 years before that.  I’ll call him Joe, to ease storytelling.

One night last week when Joe was drinking at home, he took his Ambien and went to bed.  He started acting amorous.  We’ve talked, in the past, about how unwilling I am to accept his advances when he’s taken his meds. I don’t feel he can give consent if I know he won’t remember our lovemaking.  

Joe told me he was fine with it, and appreciated my concern.  We’ve had evenings where when spooning for the night one thing leads to another and we have sex.  

Last week, the booze plus the Ambien caused him to start sexy-time.  Joe went down on me with no warm up.  It felt awkward, and I pulled away. He told me that he knew I wasn’t going to get off that way, and was going to try something different.  He grabbed a vibrator (Hitachi) and started playing we me. While it was intense, I knew I wasn’t going to orgasm.  I was stone cold sober, and just felt awkward about the whole experience.  

We’ve played with BDSM where I am very much submissive. This particular evening, he decided to top me in ways we had discussed but never formalized the boundaries.  Joe started getting rough.  Fingering me really hard, realizing it was his ticket to get me to squirt, then trying to shove his fist in me-something we’ve never done before.  When that wasn’t working he kept insisting I “relax” and tried to get the hitachi into me. It became him alternating between the toy and his fist. Even with lube, I asked him to stop several times. He would use his dominant voice and tell me to relax and open up.  

Eventually, it moved to anal play. He was just as aggressive, and not able to hear me asking to slow down or stop.  

The end resulted in me bleeding from both ends as I had several tears. 

Because of work and all around life issues, we weren’t able to talk right away. 2 days later, I texted him to say that I needed some serious aftercare.  He cancelled his plans for that night, came over, got naked and climbed into bed and held me.  I then told him a very abridged version of what happened.  “You were very “aggressive” “You pushed me far past where I expected to ever be”.  I even asked if in that kind of situation, should I have used our safety words of colors to get him to hear me, as stop and no didn’t work. 

He apologized several times.  And I accepted.  I know he would never intentionally hurt me.  I know I can’t possibly make him feel worse than he already does.  And the truth is I don’t want to.  

Tonight he made a comment about my wearing underwear to bed recently. He assumed it had to do with my periods.  Which is so completely wrong. I’m wearing underwear because there’s medication for the tearing on both sides.  I told him it had to do with our ‘rough’ night.  

We just had an argument where he tells me ITA, because I haven’t told him everything.  I told him that I didn’t want to.  All I can think, is that if I’m 100% candid, he’s going to feel like a rapist.  

I do NOT see his as such.  I just know I’m in physical pain, and don’t want to rehash as bad choice he made.  He got pissed off tonight, and has since fallen asleep because I’m upset over something that’s he’s already apologized for, and I’m shitty for not telling him everything. 

So AITA for not disclosing all the details from that night? And if so, how do I tell Joe what he did?

Now complete the following example-
input: I’m a junior in high school who has some lofty goals for college, and I understand that part of the process for really good schools is getting a good ACT score. I took it last summer and got a 34 composite, and I now have a 35 superscore. I thought that that was good enough, but I didn’t study that much for it (just took a practice test and reviewed some techniques). My worst section was math, mostly because the math on the ACT is from classes I haven’t taken in a few years, so I was a little rusty. However, I’m proud with my score and feel like it is more than adequate.

My parents, however, don’t think the same way. They think I need to take the ACT one more time, and put some serious study time into it. I don’t really want to (but am anyways) and expressed my frustration with them.

My logic: my score is still really good. The ACT is supposed to be an aptitude (predictor of future success) test rather than an achievement (test of learned skills) test, so studying for the ACT is learning to get good at the ACT and not good for what the test actually wants to test. I don’t want to take it again and take the time to study when I could do other things. Also, the other parts of my application are strong, so if my ACT is “weak” to my parents, they’re forgetting that I have other stuff as well. Also, I feel like if I took it again I’d be doing it for them and not for myself which makes me feel icky. I feel like I’d only be getting my score up so they could show off or something, which I know they wouldn’t but still feel like they would.

Their logic: I could improve my score. I know I could do better if I studied more, and one or two more points on the composite could possibly sway my results for college admission. There’s no harm in taking it again, and I’ll be happy if I improve anyways, even if I’m upset about it now.

AITA for being mad at my parents about retaking this test?

Now complete the following example-
input: Hello,

Right now I'm working as an English teacher overseas. I'm teaching a class for a group of students in their late-teens / early-twenties who have little-to-no interest in learning English. 

I'm not the *best* teacher, but I don't think I'm the worst. I believe I manage to make the class not miserable for the students by joking around and creating a relaxed atmosphere. 

There's a class in this classroom right before mine, which is led by a nice, talkative, older lady who speaks good English, as well as the native language of my students. 

^(I want to withhold judgment of her so I don't skew this post, but personally, I find her a bit nosy--she always asks what we're doing today in my class and asks to see my material and textbook and stuff (when I'm trying to set up for class in the 10 minutes between our classes). I think she's legitimately curious and interested in learning more English and stuff, but it's kind of annoying)

Anyway, she sometimes asks to sit in on my class. For all intents and purposes, I feel like I should be OK with this. Again, she's very nice, and she helps out the kids who are struggling and stuff like that. It's like a free teacher's aide, which should be helpful. 

However, you know that feeling when someone's behind your back watching you work on something? I have this feeling the entire class whenever she's in there. I feel like it affects my teaching ability to a certain extent--I try to like ""follow the textbook"" more and joke around less, which is pretty boring for the students. And, yeah, it just kind of makes me feel anxious having another teacher in the class.    

So today, when she asked if she could sit in on the class, I said no. Actually, I said, ""How about next week?"" because I didn't want to say no outright. Haha. 

AITA for telling her she couldn't stay in my class? Follow-up question: If I'm not, how should I get it across to her that it makes me feel uncomfortable having her in there?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**: I'm a teacher and another teacher asks to sit in on my class sometimes. She's nice and helps the students. However, it makes me feel nervous having her in there, so today I said no, I didn't want her to stay in my class today. AITA?

input: My parents want me to tutor my sister but I know that would just be a waste of time. The kid isn't interested in learning and never listens to what she is told, I don't want to because I don't care nor do I have the patience. I am the oldest of 4  (ages 11,7,4) I tolerate them but I don't love them. My parents allow them to do whatever they please until they get annoyed. They are not good kids, really spoiled and entitled. The middle one (7 sister) is basically failing primary school. She doesn't have any responsibilities other than doing her school work: she has a laptop.  a tutor every Saturday for 1 to 2 hours, unlimited access to books, and programs for learning. She has everything she needs but isn't interested in learning, she'd rather play. I don't care about her education if she succeeds or fails it wont impact my life. My mother is being really manipulative. I am every name under the sun if I don't do what is asks of me and then I must forgive everything and act like there is no issue without an apology.

When the first kid came I was almost 8 and I hated it but suck it up ( I hated being touched, hit and vomited on, also was ignored but that was for the best). I have always been expected to put their wants/needs over mine while ignoring all the issues they caused me if not I was selfish or whatever else my parents could think of. Honestly not bitter my mom doesn't like children and didn't want all of the stress that children cause, I was a young and independent kid that wanted approval from my parents so it makes sense. 

Anyway I'm just saying the kid isn't my problem, she doesn't want to learn and I don't want to to teach her. I even recommended to get the kid tested for some illness or something that was refused so then I explained that she would benefit from just planning to get a GED and going to trade school. School isn't for everyone so it is better to work at her level and stop holding people responsible for her.

My mom keeps telling me if she fails then I will have to help her but if that was the case she would be homeless. I am aware that isn't ""nice"" but she has no work ethic so sucks to suck.

TLDR: I refuse to teach my younger sister (age 7) considering she has a lot of resources and is choosing not to progress.

Now complete the following example-
input: Abbreviations: CR cash register, SP supervisor, OM office manager, GM general manager. AD accounting department. AT accouting ticket. Sorry, long post.

My friend recommended me to the GM in a very popular hotels chain here in Mexico, so I took the job as a receptionist. At the end of our work shift we make a deposit to AD with the cash we charged that day. When we do the check-in to the clients, we ask for a warranty of 500 pesos (26 dollars), we make a ticket, we sign it and staple it to the bill, we return the money the check-out day. When a worker loses money, they make an AT and charge the money from the paycheck, they don’t ask for a cash reposition.

One day I checked the CR and noticed that $500 were missing, I didn’t charge in cash that day, so it wasn’t my fault, I talked to my OM he told me the missing money were SP’s fault, so she made an AT with SP's name on it. The next day I did a deposit to AD and checked the CR, it had more money than it should have, $500 to be exact. SP told me to save it on the CR, so I put a note with the date, my name and wrote SURPLUS money. The next day, SP told me the OM wanted to talk so we went there, OM was angry and yelled at me that one of my client’s deposit were missing and I needed to pay those $500, I asked how is that possible since I stapled the cash with the ticket and the ticket was there. SP said the AD called saying that there were $500 missing in my deposit, so SP took the warranty with my sign and sent it to AD to cover the mistake. I asked why and said that the money was from a client, he said the OM allowed it, I said I had a surplus money days ago and those were the $500 of the deposit, he told me he took the surplus to pay his missing money bc “the OM allowed so”. I told him it wasn’t ok, OM said “the surplus money isn’t yours, so I decided to use it to pay his missing money” I was angry but I calmed down and said “ok, do an AT and send it if you think it’s my fault”, she replayed “no, you must pay in cash”, “ok, I'll pay tomorrow”. The next day I didn’t show up to work, and I went to HR instead. I told to HR what happened, she sided with me, she was upset and called the OM to discuss the matter, OM told a few lies, but I called her out every time, she blamed SP about everything. The HR lady apologized to me and said that it wouldn’t happen again, I said “I know bc I want to quit right now”, she said they really need me in the team, but my decision was done.

My friend was disappointed because he never recommends people, my coworkers were mad at me for “exposing” SP and OM, the GM was angry bc I didn’t talk to him and skipped his authority, but in my mind, he would side with the OM. I feel like a quitting ass, but I don’t want to be on a place where things like that happens. AITA for quitting in the second week without talking to the GM?

Now complete the following example-
input: My girlfriend and I have been dating for nearly 4 years. I have helped her out a hell of a lot as she was having a hard time with her family, work, and friends. It was causing her a lot of stress.

During this time, she seemed to basically invent problems for herself, constantly operating at very high emotion, as if the latest 'thing' was a complete catastrophe and she would then decide to just give up and not try with anything, until the issue was either resolved on its own or was fixed by me. These problems are mostly of her own making

We talked by this, as I eventually couldn't really cope with it anymore (my friends started getting very worried about me being depressed) and it got us both down even though there wasn't really much 'bad' going on in either of our lives. She said she didn't realise she did this at all, and that she was just making normal conversation etc. and would try to be a bit calmer.

I wasn't expecting a major difference, but there's not really been much of a difference at all. When she texts/talks to me now with a new 'thing' followed by the usual stuff she sends like 'i give up' etc. I just ignore it and let her be upset with me, because she is going to be upset anyway and there's nothing I can do about it, so at least then it doesn't effect me quite as much.

Does that make me an asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: tl;dr  Open-office rage.   I cannot get over my hatred for my co-worker, to the point I have to change jobs, and it will let down important projects for a lot of people who I care about.

AITA for not being able to get over the following concerning, let's say, ""Chatty Rob""

* The setting:  we work in about a 20x40 ""team room"" open office containing 12 people.   Close your eyes and consider how tight this space is.  Whatever one person wants to talk about is basically what everyone has to talk about. 
* Meet Chatty Rob, the compulsive one-way talker who can turn any interaction into a 10-minute digression
* He's not an un-nice guy, midwestern nice, except the aforementioned overtalking and things I'll mention below
* He really wants everyone to know all about his hobbies, which are guns and martial arts (sidebar - he has no military experience, I do, and he's not much interested in my perspective)
* He has a loud boisterous ringtone, I believe it's Looney Tunes 'That's All Folks'
* Rob doesn't have much sense of personal space.   Which is fine, except
* He doesn't seem to be a big fan of flossing, judging from the black cloud of death emanating from his gums
* When he comes to work in the morning we get 15 minutes of sports, traffic, weather from Rob.   At 3PM he declares he needs to leave to get ahead of the traffic, then digresses for another 30 minutes of news, sports, weather, and the latest idiocy from those idiots at headquarters.
* Last thing... I'll lose some sympathy here probably, but when it comes to politics in the workplace, I believe in being very passive and neutral because it's not relevant and nobody needs the conflict.   Chatty Rob on the other hand freely goes on about building Trump's wall, putting Hillary in jail, and similar themes (seemingly oblivious that we share the space with a woman, a black dude, a chinese dude, and 3 Indians).    Those are the exact opposite of my politics, so naturally I hate them, but more than that I hate that he talks about them in a shared space where anybody with half a brain might realize, hey, maybe not everybody wants to hear my thoughts on this shit.

I've raised this with management a couple of times.   They don't respond, we're a conflict-averse organization.   I try to drop hints like walling myself off with 3 monitors, or saying ""OK good chat Rob"" after 30 seconds.   None of it works.   I don't even know how to broach the subject that someone has bad breath.   It seems ridiculous that I even have to waste brainpower on this in a Fortune 100 company where everyone is supposedly professional.

It's really sad because I want to do a lot of good things to help this organization, and a number of key projects depend on me.   But quite honestly, for my mental health, I just can't work with Rob anymore.   Ever.   Can't even be in a meeting with him.  I've gone to working from home 3 days a week to avoid the shared space, and mentally speaking, it's making me kind of mental to be so isolated.

So I feel like the asshole because I unprofessionally cannot find a way to get over an annoying co-worker grudge.   In fact, am I?

Now complete the following example-
input: My family was in desperate circumstances in the 1950's.  My father was sick at the time as a child and my grandparents couldn't afford medical treatment. Then a man overheard my grandfather speaking about the difficulty to his friends. He offered to loan my grandfather to pay for my father's medical treatments (he tried to give it as a gift but my grandfather was a proud man and refused that) 

My grandfather bought proper medicine for my father and when he had enough money saved was ready to pay the man back.

However, when he contacted the address of the man. It was a hotel and the man hadn't been living there for at east a year (he had paid cash and gave no location). My grandfather looked for him but eventually gave up.

My grandfather is dead and my father and I recently looked up the man in question. It is likely that he was a member of the SS. He had committed war crimes against Jewish populations and was a strong anti-Semite. He stayed under various pseudonyms (including the one he gave us) and moved every now and then before the authorities could gain a trace on him.

I feel very conflicted on the one hand this man in question was known for executing Jews in particularly vicious ways. On the other hand my father might not be alive without him.  It is definitely the same person. 

I want to create a charitable trust in this man's name at some point. As I think it will be a way of showing that even very brutal people can occasionally do some good.

The main problem is, I don't really want him to get this computer, especially since he has no money saved up.

I can't say I was too super happy with it just due to the nature of the work but it wasn't anything awful. However lately it's gotten so fucked. My schedule has been changed with no warning and my hours are all screwy.

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm 38 weeks and 4 days (full term) on baby #4. There's just barely 11 months between our last two kids and I'm freaking tired and sore.

My pregnancy has been rough the last 2 months. The baby was breech up to 37 weeks and when he finally flipped the unexpected pressure caused me to end up with several hemorrhoids that I had to have removed and left me nearly incapable of walking. He went breech again and this morning I was in the hospital to have him flipped again. They told me I was full term and good to go into labor at any time but being that I had three more days to 39 weeks they couldn't induce me because of insurance purposes. Given the baby has gone breech twice, which would mean I needed a c-section, I was not eager to have to wait it out and risk him flipping again. 

We came home after the successful flip, I went and layed down for a nap and woke up to contractions. Given I was having some decent contractions I wanted to go for a walk to hope to speed things up. Like I mentioned I'm very tired being pregnant. I also historically have had very long labors with my shortest one being 8 hours from the time of checking into hospital to birth and my longest being 74 hours from check-in to birth, my third being 36+. 

My husband got upset at me because I was trying to walk and speed things up and he wanted to go to his kids swimming class. I got upset because I didn't appreciate his kids swim class being more important than me possibly going into labor. I never asked him to stay home with me, although I do believe he should have and in the end I adamantly told him to go to the swim class because I was so angry he was trying to get me to go sit down and slow things down. AITA for walking to speed things up and not wanting to be pregnant anymore?

Now complete the following example-
input: My boyfriend is in the Army and we decided we’re going to go about the non-traditional way of life and we’re going to get married since we both know that’s what we want and we can be together without worry if we were already married. There’s a lot of detail and such, this post would be too long if I got into it, so to the point. My parents have already freaked out about me moving states away, and my mom has even made a comment to my older sister and I about keeping important things like marriage not necessary a secret from her but really keeping her out of the loop about it and she would be really hurt if we planned it without her knowing. Anyway, my boyfriend and I have been thinking about eloping and then later in a few years after we’ve saved up money to have the actual ceremony. I’ve told him we can just call the in between the “engagement” but honestly if anyone asks I’ll say I’m married because I love him and in no way am I going to keep this a secret. I honestly have no idea how to go about this with my family though. I know he’s the one for me, and he feels the same way 100% about me, there’s no doubt or fear for either of us about our relationship, we’ve talked about this for several months and this is what we both want.

input: Hi, first time poster, long time lurker, sorry beforehand for any mistakes, there's a **TL:DR** included below, also English isn’t my first language either.

I (30M|Agnostic Jew) was introduced to this lady (30F|7th Day Adventist), and we had great chemistry from the start. We went on a lunch date, but she kept pushing the religion topic more and more during lunch, asking many questions, all of which I answered honestly. Despite finding her very charming and gorgeous, I could foresee religion becoming an issue down the line. Later that day, she asked me through text why we didn’t kiss, and I confessed. We talked and agreed that it would be best if we parted ways.

I didn’t contact her after that, and focused on moving on, but after about a week, out of the blue, she texted me saying:

""Hi this is XYZ, remember me? :) How about we start over from scratch? I think we had great chemistry together and should give it a shot despite our last convo, what do you say?""

I was ecstatic, and agreed to see her. A couple of days later, she asked if I was willing to meet her community, to which I said: ""Sure!"". As we discussed this, it turned out that it wasn't a ""Meet&amp;Greet"", but a full-blown Bible Camp, to which I had to commit 3 days a week, every week

So, while I thought that she had found a compromise, and was willing to look beyond our differences regarding religion, what she actually meant was "" I want to date you, so you should adopt my religion"". After she confirmed this, things went sour pretty fast. She said two meanspirited things:

1.	It was my fault for ending things and closing the door on ""us"", since I was unwilling to give her faith, and therefore our relationship, a shot, while stating I was asking too much of her to ""set aside her duty to her Lord and savior"" - that last bit was her answer when asked if she could not see herself beside a person who didn't share her religion, but would still support her

2.	Implied I was to blame for our mutual heart break, since I chose to interpret her message the way I saw it best, since she had always been forthcoming in the notion that I would have to adopt her faith, even in that specific text

I'm not concerned about the first thing, because I made it abundantly clear I was not looking to embrace any faith, I merely reciprocated what to me was a beautiful gesture of hers. I am concerned about the second statement though.

**AITA / WITA for interpreting her message in the way I wanted it to, or was it an honest mistake?**

**TL:DR**: I (30's M - Agnostic Jew) met a lady (30's F - Adventist), but due to her beliefs we decided not to move forward with relationship, agreeing it was for the best. A week later, she text’s me out of the blue asking to “start from scratch”, but after a great date, things go sour, with her implying I was to blame for our heart break, because what she meant by “from scratch” is me converting to her beliefs, and not finding common ground through mutual respect and understanding

input: For Christmas this year I went home to see my family. One of our big traditions is we always go and see a movie on Christmas Day. This year we decided to go see Mary Poppins Returns. I decided to be nice and I bought the tickets for everyone who wanted to go. We get to the Theatre and everyone is pretty excited. I’m sitting next to my mom and the aisle because the theatre was packed.

I loved the movie right away and was into it the whole time but every time I would look at my mom she looked so bored. I didn’t really think anything of it till halfway through when I hear this loud crunching noise. I look over and she is chomping her ice extremely loud. I whisper to her if she is really doing that and she says “I need some way to stay awake during this boring movie”. I was never bored so I decided to ignore her but she kept doing it. At this point I was getting annoyed because everyone else around us didn’t deserve this. She then made a snoring noise and I was so embarrassed.

The movie eventually ended and I thought it was great. Everyone else in my family did as well. We leave the theatre and in the car home my mom decides that she should give me a lecture about my “rude” behavior.

Now I’m an adult so I stood up for myself and said that her behavior was not appropriate for a quiet movie theatre. She didn’t like that and gave me a lecture about how I need to respect her more and how she’s my mom so I need to listen to her.

My question is AITA? Was her behavior actually okay?

Now complete the following example-
input: My bf isn't a redditor but we sometimes scroll through this sub together, so if he happens to be reading this... Hi M...

&amp;#x200B;

We got into a big fight over some chick who he told me was a former casual sex partner. He told me they weren't even friends, they would do things then she would leave right after. He told me she was actually married (she's not anymore) but in the process of leaving her husband so he made sure she completely understood what they were doing wasn't anything serious.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I know all this is because she had posted on his FB wall a song, and said ""this will forever remind me of you"". So I asked him who she was and he told me what I wrote above. I told him I really don't appreciate her posting stuff like that on his wall if she was just a former casual lay. We talked about her and I told him if she does it again we're going to have problems. I made it pretty obvious I was insecure and uncomfortable about her. He basically laughed at me, told me ""she's all the way in \[state 1000s of miles away\], you don't have anything to worry about"" and then even got in a VC in discord and laughed and told our mutual friends ""haha my gf is so jealous"". I decided to just forget about it and turn the other cheek, which I did. I wasn't bothered and we had a good rest of the day. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

That is until literally the next day. Everything was fine but then I remembered something from a few months before. She had actually posted a bunch of monkey emojis (🙊🙉🙈) to him on their friendiversary. I didn't get bothered at all when this happened because he didn't acknowledge her post, and I kind of figured she was just some former casual partner from his past. But realizing it was the same girl who posted the song and comment on his wall, when she KNOWS we're in a relationship (she liked our relationship post and I post things on his wall all the time), and knowing she was just a notch in his belt so she was quite literally remembering and reminiscing on his damn penis, not their ""friendship"", infuriated me. She was being blatantly disrespectful, so I got really mad (at her, not him which I told him this) and told him she's being disrespectful, and I told him ""Unfriend her."" The reason I TOLD him instead of asking or just talking to him about it is because of how he reacted the previous day when I brought her up. Also, he always tells me if I want something from him or want him to do something, ""TELL me because I can't read your mind"". So that's what I did. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At first he just said ""Whatever, I removed her. Hope you're happy."" I told him to stop being an ass after he said this, and he said ""I'm the ass?"" then we both just kind of blew up on each other. He is claiming he could care less about her, but he doesn't like that I'm ""giving him an ultimatum"" by telling him to remove her. I'm feeling really hurt and angry now because of his reaction to removing a girl who apparently means nothing to him, and again the only reason I TOLD him was because I had brought it up the other day she was making me uncomfortable yet he did nothing. Honestly Facebook is cancer and this all feels so childish typing it out, but I do use Facebook for memes and to share things with my bf, and I'd rather not see some girl from his past blatantly disrespecting our relationship when I get on. If things were reversed and some dude from my past was posting stuff like this on my wall, I would've removed/blocked or even messaged him and told him to stop in a heartbeat. So yea, I'm hurt because I feel like it's no big deal to him and he doesn't care, and I feel like he didn't want to remove her which is why he's so defensive now. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So yea... Who is the asshole? Me? Him? Both of us?

input: I'm no longer a minor, and haven't had contact with him in 6+months. 
When I was 16-17 I met a guy online who I grew to be friends with. He'd offer me gifts and money, and being young an naive I accepted. We were friends on Facebook- I've since deactivated- which is how I learnt he and his **wife** got **married in Disney land** while we were talking, and that she was **trying for a baby with IVF**. I found this especially shitty, as his wife (and I imagine him) dont have unlimited money and IVF is expensive. She could have spent several thousand trying for a baby with this man. 
Again, being naive and admittedly an asshole I continued the exchange. Eventually last year aged 19 I cut him off, but not after sending him photos/videos  for money. 
I have email evidence he agreed to pay me for nude videos while I was an adult, but because I deleted facebook and the site I met him on since that's all I have.
I also have PayPal statements going back to when i was a minor that are undeniably from him.

It's now been months, and I've entered my own relationship and realise his wife deserves to know. I dont know if she's still on IVF or if they've managed to conceive yet. I dont even know if she'd believe me. It would definately take a huge toll on their marriage and I own up to my share of the guilt for continuing it after finding this out.
If it makes a difference what he's sent me has to total nearly $500, and he never pressured me into anything or held it above my head.

Now complete the following example-
input: I was in my car and got to texting a friend who said she had just went gym which is around a 15 minutes drive from where I was. She said she hadn’t eaten properly (eating disorder), didn’t have money (not sure how true this is) and was too tired to even move. I called and she was already angry but I remained calm and it was obvious she wanted a lift so I said ok, drop your location and I’ll be there soon. 

So I go to her location and it’s a no drive zone. I call her asking her if she can walk a little bit to me as I didn’t know where she was exactly but she just got really extraction at me saying you’ve tried to make the situation better but you’ve just made it worse and you always do this and just going on about why I drove there and not to her exactly. She was really close, like 5 minutes maximum walk. 

After she said that I just told her I’m going back and she can get her own ride. Still not sure how she got back but whatever. After that she texted me saying it was really unfair for me to leave her so quickly and not talk it out at least and put up with it. I’m still not sure if I should have. Another thing that annoyed me about the situation is she kept mentioning she really wants food and I’m assuming she wanted me to buy her food. 

So AITA? 

Also some random background info, she’s been a friend for a few months and she helped me out of a really tough spot a while ago. Since then I’ve been doing really good but she still seems to have the same bad habits, same mentality and every time we meet I feel like the conversation is always about her problems and me trying to support her. I genuinely feel like I’ve helped her when she’s been in a tough spot as well but atm, I kinda feel guilt tripped to stick through her anger/depressive moods because she helped me? I DO want to help her but she makes it really hard to and I feel like I’m sort of the emotional sponge here and my job is literally to cheer her up every time we meet. She said that she only does that because I never talk about myself but she doesn’t really give me a chance to and she never asks questions about me. I’m positive it’s not just me being a plank either because I’ve been talking to a lot of people lately and I’ve never felt conversations were this one sided with anyone else. 

So I guess a double AITA? Am I being a bad friend for not wanting to help her with problems even though she helped me with mine?

input: REPOST: (Last post had mentions of stuff that I guess wasn't 'sub appropriate')

Over the last five years or so my father has been getting progressively worse in the way he treats my brother and I. However he has been treating my mom like shit since she started working again. He constantly degrades her to my brother and I when she isn't home, he talks about her to family, and constantly puts down her appearance and life choices if he doesn't personally agree with them. 

My mother is has lost nearly thirty pounds since she began working and is now sitting at about 90 to 100 pounds. She's stopped eating and just gets up to work. Now, we had a conversation not too long ago about how she was depressed and contemplating some pretty messed up things. I blankly told her that my brother and I don't even really like our father and that she should just leave him because even though she isn't my favorite person all the time, she doesn't deserve to be treated like absolute shit everyday after a 10 hour work day.  She promised me that she would consider it and that if he doesn't stop smoking, drinking, and actually find a job she will leave him.

My cousin who was over at the time had been listening in and told me that I needed to stay out of my parent's business and that I had no right to try and break their marriage up.

Now complete the following example-
input: There’s a lot I could say about this, but I know this isn’t an advice sub, so I’m going to keep it short. A friend that I used to be close to but haven’t hung out with in two years reconnected with me recently. We’ll call him Alex. I originally distanced myself from Alex because he has some mental health issues that he refuses to get help with. I felt like a therapist, as did two of our other mutual friends at the time. He was completely reliant on other people for his happiness. Personally, I just couldn’t do it anymore, and he would not listen to anybody’s advice. 

I was going to give him a second chance after we reconnected (I ran into him at a bar), but later that night, he sent me a long-ass text in which he essentially explained to me how difficult the past two years have been. The things he told me he’s been through since we last spoke, I am honestly astounded that he still refuses therapy. To each their own I guess, but not when it means thrusting your emotional problems onto others. Anyways, somewhere in the middle of this long-ass text, he told me that if we don’t hangout while he’s home from school, he will never speak to me again. 

Now, the problem here is that I went to a very small high school, and many of us still see each other. There is no way I’ll be able to get around not seeing him again, unless I plan on turning down invites to future social events that he may be at. His younger brother and my younger brother are friends, too, and often times they all hangout together in a small group.  This is where I’m questioning if I’m the asshole. My brother seems to think that if I don’t hangout with Alex, it makes things weird for him as well. While this may be true, there are a lot of other reasons not listed here to help explain why I don’t want to see him, and I don’t feel as though I should have to associate with someone just so that things won’t be ‘weird’ in the future — especially when that person only brings negativity and drama into my life. Him threatening not to speak to me ever again is what really sealed the deal for me. To me, that’s just not something a grown adult should be saying. 

What do you guys think? Am I being an asshole by not reaching out to him?

But now I'm 25, getting married and pregnant with my own first child. My sister has had a second child and is no longer a single mum, but her partner works a lot (they're saving to buy a home while living with my mum), so I still feel bad. I'm lucky enough not to have to work as my partner earns enough for both of us, but I'm having a really difficult pregnancy. I have had joint issues for a long time and this has just gotten worse with pregnancy, plus my nephew is in nursery and always sick! I feel like I've helped my sister enough, I did sacrifice a lot and she hasn't always treated me well or been grateful. But my parents keep telling me how much she's struggling and how I need to feel more sympathy for her and help her more. I don't want to get sick and use up all my limited energy on helping my sister right now. AITA?

input: I need some outside opinions on this. Throwaway because she knows my reddit handle. 

My fiancee, 22, and me, 21, have two cats. She grew up with always having dogs, so is experienced in raising and caring for dogs. She moved in with me a year ago and then we got both of our cats after that.  Both cats dumped on us. We have raised from the brink of death back to health. They absolutely adore us, but favor me over her when it comes to bedtime and couch vegging.

She recently expressed interest in adopting a dog. So she could have companionship when off work as she works 3 12 hour shifts a week. 
I of course said yes, so we started looking to adopt at the local shelter, we found a dog after a week of searching and the shelter said that she was great with other dogs and cats alike. 

We placed the application for adoption and were approved immediately, so we brought the dog home (chow chow mix) 

The first day we spent with a professional dog trainer helping us do introductions, the dog at first didn't care about the cats, but after 3 days she has started growling whenever she sees them, lunging snarling, etc. Basically If we didn't have the dog leashed she wouldve attacked and tried to kill the cats. 

We tried separating them into rooms but nothing has worked. I told her I dont want to see our cats torn to shreds if our super visions lapsed. We never leave the dog with the cats obviously, as she is crate trained. 

Just today the dog has lunged at one of our cats snarling and growling. 

I told her we cant keep the dog and need to bring it back to the shelter as it's only a matter of time before a cat ends up dead or seriously injured. 

Am I the asshole here? I feel like I'm ruining what could be a great friendship with her new dog, but at the same time I dont want our cats to end up dead.

input: Title might make me a little bit of an asshole without any context to the story, but here it is.

&amp;#x200B;

This happened a good 5 years ago, when i made this account actually and I'm guessing it's going to be my throwaway from now on. However, i think about this from time to time and wonder if i was the asshole in this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

My family's cat is an outdoor cat and has been living peacefully, albeit a few skirmishes with the cat across the street now and then, in the neighborhood for as long as i can remember. Our new neighbors had just moved in from the countryside and brought with them their own cat which is a pretty big cat, slightly bigger than mine, but much younger and more territorial.  At first, it was okay and thought it would be another situation with the other cat across the street, but it turned much worse than i could have imagined. My cat is old and has been through some stuff, a stitched up stomach due to it being cut open after him being stuck under a fence and an almost lost ear from his glory days along with other small tweaks but still has some fight in him. After a few weeks, i start hearing cat fights almost nightly and i would go out and pick up my cat and clear up the fights since i was a light sleeper and my family doesn't hear it that often. I lost sleep but whatever, cats gotta cat. However, one night, there was a louder than normal cat fight and i could hear my cat moaning very distinctly. i rush out and he's on the ground with the other cat circling him and runs off once i rush at him and i take my cat back inside. There's blood all around my cat's stomach and my cat doesn't look good so i do my best to patch him up and my dad takes him in the first thing in the morning to the vet for emergency and he's all stitched up but he's pretty weak when he returns so we keep him inside. The other cat got more and more confident and would stalk outside my house and patio and would get in a face-off with my cat through the windows. We started limiting my cat's outside hours for when we're home and shut him in when it's night. The other cat gets wise to this and sneaks in through my kitty door even when we're home or when the person watching the house runs off for errands and they to get in catfights indoors, whilst scratching up our floors and furniture and eating his food. One night I forgot to close it up and again, another ensuring catfight inside my house, and my cat is hurt badly again. At that moment I suggested to my dad we take the cat and move him away. He agrees, and throughout the week, we tried to lure the cat into our house and finally got him. We took the cat to an affluent neighborhood and let him loose. Few days later, little girl comes to our door and asks if we've seen their cat lately and we say no. That cat cost us thousands in vet bills and I switch from feeling like an asshole to being justified in the decision even today.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Neighborhood cat is way territorial and my cat can't compete. Try to change him to an mostly indoor cat but other cat comes in multiple times and catfights ensnare and damage is done to my cat which equals up to a pretty penny. Kidnap the cat and let him loose in another neighborhood.

Well it’s cold where I live so I have her wearing sweaters because she gets so cold she shivers, She’s been wearing sweaters in the cold weather every year her whole life. 
Every time my grandma sees her (which is a lot I live with her atm) she tries to take her sweater off, says she’s “uncomfortable”. 
She also encourages her to jump on people during greetings even though she’s not supposed to, feeds her table food, screams at me for calling it table food because it’s “dinner food” ???  I just really don’t want her around my SD anymore even though it’s unavoidable for the time being.

input: This happened years ago and I have always wondered if I was the asshole. Among my friends and the few who witnessed it the verdict is split. 

I'm at a tradeshow one day, a fairly busy one, and a girl with one leg goes by on crutches. Sure enough just a few feet from me, she falls. She was in decent shape, young (i'd guess 20's) and more than capable of getting back up. Nonetheless about half a dozen people go running over, asking if shes ok, trying to help her up, picking her crutches up from the ground, etc. But not me. I just stayed where I was even though I was the closest to her. 

&amp;#x200B;

My co-worker comes over after the fuss dies down and just rips into me. How could I just stand there? Why wouldn't I help her? What the Hell is wrong with me?

&amp;#x200B;

My reasoning: I thought she would be more embarrassed by everyone running over there to help her up, something she could clearly do on her own, than she would be if people simply asked if she was ok and moved on. In my mind the act of falling wasn't that big of a deal but all the attention drawn to it was a little humiliating. I still think from the way her face reddened at all the attention that I had the right approach. It's not like she was struggling to get up and I ignored that, I just wanted to avoid embarrassing her further. My co-workers disagreed, my friends are split.

input: This happened just a few minutes ago but it's seriously bothering me because I feel bad about it??
Basically my braces just came off and as I was walking to the lobby, a woman who works there asked if I wanted my picture taken for the Facebook page. I instantly said no and my guardian kept telling me I should, as well as the woman holding the camera and another dentist. I kept refusing and ended it by turning to my guardian and saying ""I don't want to"". The women said they wouldn't force me and gave up, but as soon as we went out the door he turned to me and said to stop acting like that all the time and that it embarasses him, and that I should be ashamed that I didn't want to pay them back for the hard work they did. It made me feel really crappy.

input: Throwaway.

&amp;#x200B;

So I (13F) have a friend (Also 13F) who we'll call Emma. I was hanging out with Emma and my two other friends (12M &amp; 12F). We'll name them Zack and Julia, respectively. For some background info, Zack really didn't like Emma and Julia was cool with her. Emma also *really* likes Disney. This is pretty long so TL;DR at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't remember how the topic came up, but we started talking about Disney World. Julia was the only one who had never been there, so I told her what it was like.  I talked about how you could wait in lines to meet the characters. Then I said, ""Oh, but I hate doing that. What's the point of waiting hours to meet people in costumes?"" Emma suddenly said, ""What do you mean? They're not in costumes! Those are the real characters!"" We all got pretty confused, and I thought she was joking at first. Zack, who I'm guessing thought she was joking too, laughed and said that they were obviously people in costumes. Emma seemed to get really angry after that. Julia explained calmly, ""Emma, you *do* realize that those aren't actually Mickey and stuff... right?"" Everyone but Emma agrees and she starts getting really riled up now. She rants to us that just because we don't believe in that stuff, doesn't mean we should say that its fake. I got pretty pissed at that point and told her, ""How would a mouse from a cartoon even come to life anyway?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

She stopped talking to us after I said that, so Zack, Julia, and I got on to the topic of all the fake characters we were lied to, like Santa, the Easter Bunny, etc. and Emma overheard us and got even *more* pissed. She stilled believed in all those things and she was angry that we would say that stuff. We told her that these characters were fake as well, which was a mistake. She claims that we 'do this all the time to her' (which I'm pretty sure we did not, maybe Zack sometimes but not everyone) and that she was going to text her mother that we were bullying her. I had had enough of her at that point and just stopped talking to her. We're on good terms now, and I don't talk about fake characters being real or not, but I feel like I might've been TA for bringing it up at all.  


TL;DR - Friend gets mad that my other friends and I told her a bunch of fictional characters are fake, she gets mad and yells at us, I tell her off a bit, she threatens to tell her mom on us.  


AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: My ex and I had a amicable but long drawn breakup. The context of that is not that important obviously but I knew he didn't love me anymore and things were going to change. We shared two cats we essentially rescued from his friend as kittens. They has severe eye infections and a terrible case of fleas . We both nursed them back to health together. We we're very attached to these cats and treated them as our children (crazy cat people lol) I was the one that moved out and he kept the cats (something that at the time of our breakup he demanded) I was always the one to give in and honestly I didn't want to make the situation harder than it already was.  I didn't want to rip my cats out of the home they've   become so adjusted to. Anyway to the point of where the assholerie might have happened..after the breakup I was still allowed visits and was responsible for food and litter, a situation happened and I had to jump ship to protect myself at the time knowing I would probably never see those cats again. It's been difficult to even think about them without tears forming in my eyes and this wave of guilt flooding over me. So I don't. I don't think of them. I don't look at pictures I don't try to remember no, nada, nothing. Complete detachment. Recently we got into an argument and he brought up the fact that I don't ""give a fuck about the cats"". All of our interactions have been though text or calls and we only do speak because I still have some items left in his home and again we're for the most part pretty amicable. I don't hate the guy but I do resent him for keeping them. He knows and has heard me completely break down over the phone if he even just brings them up. I try not to talk about them and give him vague answers when he does bring them up through text for his credit. Reddit I need to know am I the asshole for not caring about these cats ?

Now complete the following example-
input: So I (29M) have this really good and considerate friend, J (28F).  She set up a trip this year to Bonaroo with me, a close friend, and one of her random friends, A (26F).  Now J has been trying to hook me up with A, and I was receptive to the idea because she's cute and she was cool the few times when we hung out.  She's not interested in a relationship right now, and I told her that was cool, lets be friends.

feel like we need to get to know each other since we'll have to spend a week together, and she's expressed that she feels the same way, but in no way do her actions reflect that.  I've tried four times to get her to hang out and she's always busy.  Cool, I'm understanding, but she has never invited me to hang.  I text her and try to get to know her, she gives short answers and usually just stops responding.  Yesterday I thought, I'll send a joke to break the ice, she did not respond at all.  Keep in mind, she had  asked J why I wasn't trying to be friends with her, why I wasn't texting her, and that she really wanted to get to know me.

I'm normally a long fuse kind of guy, but I find the whole thing to be widely inconsiderate and it's pretty frustrating.  This morning, I decided to be straight with her about how I feel so I texted her, ""Jesus fuck do you ever make it hard for people trying to be your friend.  Like holy shit, buddy, you're about as hard to talk to as a bear fucking a goose.""

I feel mostly validated in my feelings, and I've been nothing but nice up to this point. I would say the same thing to any of my friends, who all know that I'm blunt.  I'd rather air the issue than skirt it passive aggressively.  J says this is totally out of character, for A, so I feel like maybe I was too harsh.

Now complete the following example-
input: Me and my boyfriend have been dating for almost 5 months now. We’re both seniors in high school and plan to have a future together when we graduate. 

Our relationship has been going through some hardships right now and I’m currently not allowed to hang out with him due to my strict parents. 

Well, my 18th birthday is next Saturday, and it was something I was really looking forward to, because we haven’t been able to go out and do something for about a month or so. I figured that on my 18th birthday my parents wouldn’t deny my request to go and do something with him, so it made it even more special to me. 

However, he recently got invited on a trip with his old boy scout troop and it happens to fall over the day of my birthday. When he first told me I was visibly upset, because I really was looking forward to spending that day with him. We got into a rather big argument over it and he claimed I was being inconsiderate. He also mentioned that it was his last trip with all his childhood friends and old troop leader and that we could do something for my birthday as soon as he got back. I eventually just let it go and told him I was fine with him going, even though it still really makes me sad. I tried to not be selfish and understand that we can just celebrate my birthday when he gets back. 

But AITA for being upset/mad in the first place? AITA for wanting him to skip the trip to spend my birthday with me?

Problem is her boyfriend is here a lot. Like sometimes 2 weeks straight and then leaves for maybe 4-5 days and comes back staying for a week or 2. He works in my city but lives an hour away so whenever he has shifts he stays here.

input: I left my country and settled in a far away country because i wanted a clean break from my entire family tree...i stay in touch with immediate family...i dont really like or agree with my folks (any of them) but i dont like upsetting them all the time by telling them so, so i pretty much stay diplomatic for the duration of phone calls i have to endure...

My dad is well off..and both my parents consider themselves loving and caring...but thats soo not the reality...

Eg. they showed their generosity to my older brother (they all love each other and get along) by buying him a house when he got married...my dad insisted on shorter term loan and cosigned the mortgage which meant higher monthly mortgage payments...my brother could not afford the payments so my dad took over the payments..fast forward 5-6 years, now my dad and mum treat my bro and his wife as if they should be at their beck and call, and almost like servants because they bought them a house...my dad even talks down to them and mum get into arguments with sister in law...i mean they get upset if my sister in law treats her own mother nicer than she treated my mum!!!! I mean cmon!!! Its her mother!!!!

Anyways my parents decided that they want to buy me a house but not in the country i have been living with my husband for last 8 yrs but in my home country...this time, no mortgage, dad cosigning the property, to be paid off in 3 yrs (its £500,000 house!!! With £250 monthly maintenance fee for life!!!! Which i will be legally responsible for since i co-own the property)...i pointed out that i cannot contribute because i have to pay for my house/food here, so they should scrap the plan to buy, and if they want to help, help with the deposit for the house we want to buy here...

Ofcourse my dad went ahead and put a non refundable deposit down for the house in my home country...and i had no choice but to play along...but i made it clear that i wont be contributing towards the house..

and lo and behold, now there is this expectation that i should be extremely grateful to them...

I am soo not grateful...me and my hubby both have auto immune conditions, quality of life is sub par but we are happy living humble life we do have...now they dangle a dream in front of us that we will never get to spend our lives in and yet, i am supposed to show them gratitude!!!??

Note: the house will be registered officially in mine and dads name in feb 2019...i am thinking of letting my bro have it because he is clearly putting up with all the shit i refused to put up with so maybe he deserves it

Now complete the following example-
input: So a couple of days ago my grandaunt (the sister of my grandma) passed away at 98 years of age. My mom is shattered, since she has always been very close to her aunt and visited her about 3 times per week. So the past couple of days have been very rough and emotional for her.

Me (24F) and my brother (23M) on the other hand, didn’t see our grandaunt very often, probably once a year or even less. My grandaunt was a very complicated woman and she would criticize us a lot. She was also very religious and would regularly give us slack for not going to church (I’m an atheist). I therefore didn’t like her very much. 

Because of her complicated persona and her old age, my grand-aunt didn’t have many friends or family. My mom is therefore arranging the whole funeral by herself. I will be surprised if more than 30 people show up tbh. 

Anyways, my mom will be speeching and she asked me to do the same, since ‘I am the oldest’ and also because there will probably be no one else to give a speech. I refused, and told her that I wasn’t even close to my grandaunt and I cannot think of anything nice to say. My mom was very disappointed, and asked me if instead I wanted to read my grandaunt’s favorite poem at the funeral, and that ‘it would mean so much to her \[my mom\]’ if I did. She showed me the poem and it was *extremely* religious, talking about God and Jesus and about going to heaven, etc. I told my mom there is no way that I am going to read it, since it goes against some of my core beliefs and I would feel like a hypocrite if I would (not only because I’m not religious, but also because I just didn’t like my grandaunt). 

Now my brother just called me a couple of hours ago, telling me that I should ‘stop being such a little bitch’ and just read the poem for my mom. He told me that mom feels very upset and also arranging the funeral on her own has been very rough for her, and that this is ‘the least I can do’ to show her that at least I care. I told him that ‘if I were dead I wouldn’t want someone I rarely knew to speak at my funeral’ and also that ‘instead of giving me a hard time you could also just offer to read the poem yourself, if you care so much’. But he counters that by saying that ‘mom specifically asked you’. 

I really do not feel comfortable reading this weird religious piece of text at the funeral of someone I truly disliked, even though I know I’d make my mother extremely happy if I did. Am I being an asshole? 

**TL; DR:  Grandaunt (my grandma’s sister) passed away and my mom asked me to read my grandaunt’s favorite (very religious) poem on her funeral. I refused, because I am an atheist and because I generally just didn’t like the woman. Overreacting?**

input: My parents have always thought that me (14, almost 15F,) should be able to get my permit when I'm 15 and then drive when I turn 16. They both agree that driving is an important skill to have and they want me to drive me and my brother to and from school. I brought up this topic after dinner the other day, seeing as I'm turning 15 very soon, and turns out my mother had a change of heart. 

She now thinks that I don't need to drive until I'm 18 and it would be worthless to let me get my license. Now, I strongly disagree because I want to be able to hang out with friends, and more importantly, drive to school and any summer job/internship/volunteer work. I argued with her a bit, asking if she would be willing to drive me around during the summer and she agreed. I know this is not viable AT ALL because she has a job definitely would not be able to drive me to and from the zoo everyday for me to volunteer.

My dad, on the other hand, completely agrees with me. He thinks there is a very good reason why I should be able to drive and fully supports me in this argument. 

I am pretty upset with my mother because she's always been okay with me driving when I'm 16 (perhaps even more than okay, seeing as she offered to buy me a car) and now she suddenly thinks driving is a dumb idea for me. There are plenty of good reasons why I should be able to drive, but in my eyes, it seems like my mom is flat out ignoring all of them.

So what do you think guys? Am I the asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: I (28f) have like 5 or 6 people I would call my close friends. I got married in March, and moved an hour away from them. I work full time and I'm in my last year of my Psychology bachelor. My husband and I pretty much fit in an hour or 2 of TV per night, but the rest of the day, we're doing things we have to do. 

When I first got married, one friend called me selfish and said she felt used because I was always available before I got in a relationship and never am now that I have my husband. I did reduce seeing her alot more after I got engaged, mainly because things started getting alot more hectic with uni and I was in and out of a few jobs, dealing with bipolar disorder, newly engaged, studying, and honestly, I actually realized how little time I want to spend on ALWAYS being available for other people. Previously, I had been extremely generous with my time, and I could no longer justify spending my time doing favours for others or doing things I genuinely don't like doing (like spending Christmas with her very racist family). I feel like, I dont get much time to do what I want (sometimes I just want to stare at the wall and do absolutely nothing for an hour) so when I do have some spare time, I would rather spend it by myself than sit with someone for an hour. I feel reenergized and feel like I get in contact with my inner self. 

Over the past month or 2, I've started resenting most of my friends, and only feel like I can actually tolerate one now. Everyone else just complains and makes me feel bad about me not wanting to drink (I hate hangovers), about me not going for trips (I really cannot afford to and even if I could, I'd go on a proper honeymoon with my husband), and not being there for them. Yes I feel bad but I am already exhausted with so much other crap, I can't fathom doing everything I used to do. 

Anyway i literally want to burn bridges now, cos I can't seem to shake them, but my conscience is eating away at me. AITA?

We're both 22 I'm like 5'8 he's maybe 5'5, we spoke on and off for a week and he asked me out to a bar I had no plans and so I agreed and it was a good time he's a nice guy. But the more I was thinking about it during the date the more I thought to myself that it won't work out because he's a lot shorter than me. I still enjoyed the date and he paid our tab, after that we were speaking and he mentioned we should go to this cool other bar next time. And I just said I wasn't feeling anything between us, he was kinda bummed but said any particular reason? So I just told him I don't really like shorter guys, and he surprisingly took it very well. He said no problem I get it, thanks for the honesty and we hugged and went on our on ways. 

I told one of my friends this who's a guy and not short he's like avg height and he said that was super vain and shallow as the way I was describing him he was a nice guy and he can't control his height. However, my GF's think I was well in my right too and that its a deal breaker for them too and I'm not an ass.

Now complete the following example-
input: AITA: 
Everyone in my office (mostly women) seems obsessed with who poops in which bathroom. There is one women’s bathroom upstairs where all of the cubicles are, and there are several downstairs where the main lobby, kitchen, and everything else is. On my first day here the HR rep told me the downstairs bathrooms were the designated “pooping”bathrooms. I’ve heard office gossip about one girl who allegedly poops in the upstairs bathroom just to spite everyone. At an office meeting yesterday one of the women in my office made an announcement to reiterate this rule, and complained that someone had pooped in the upstairs bathroom and that it smelled up the entire office. Even though whoever pooped had used the air freshener that’s in there, this apparently only caused the two smells to mingle. I feel that this is extremely petty and on the level of high school girl behavior. Especially to bring it up in a meeting as if it’s official business worth sharing to everyone. Personally I use the upstairs bathroom to poop if all of the downstairs bathrooms are full or if I just don’t feel like going all the way downstairs. I do feel a little spiteful when doing so because I feel they are being so petty about their “rule”. However my cubicle is not near the bathroom so I actually can’t be sure if it truly smells or not. I also don’t think that my poop ever smells that bad or strong, but I can’t be sure of that either because people tend to be a little smell blind to their own poop. I understand being disgusted by the smell of someone else’s poop, I also think it’s super gross. I just feel that these women take it too far, so I continue to poop upstairs. Am I the asshole for spitefully pooping upstairs, and possibly putting the petty women through the uncomfortable experience of having to smell my poop? 

(FYI I was given the name of the woman who is accused of spitefully pooping upstairs, it’s not me. Again I’m not sure if they know that I poop upstairs or not)

input: I am going to try to write this as neutral as possible, so I will try to stick to facts, no personal feelings.... I'm sure I'm going to fall short, but I'll give it a go.
My husband of well over a decade is about to deploy. This past weekend may be his last weekend home. His grandmother recently passed away. We (me, him, our daughter) attended the services on Friday, almost 3 hours from our house. When he and I moved in together, he hadn't talked with that set of grandparents in years. Nothing happened, they were just never close, and weren't big talkers, so it just happened. I made it a point for him (along with me and our children) to reconnect. We have spent an important holiday with them every year, for over 15 years. Including when he is deployed. I still take our kids to see that side of the family, even if he's not with us.
So, we go to the services, get home, and change into pajamas. I had mentioned 2 weeks prior that friends from work were meeting for dinner that night, but DID NOT say a word about it that day. He says ""you can go out."" I ask if he's sure, throw some Jean's on, and head out. 
The next day, we were supposed to take our kids to a Mardi Gras parade. This had been planned for weeks. I got up that morning, made breakfast, prepped, and arranged to pick up my daughter's friend. Then he said he and my son would just stay home. My daughter, me, and her friend drove down, had a great time with my aunt, sisters, and nieces. After the parade, we went to my friend's mom's house. Kids had a great time goofing off and eating ice cream.
I started to get tired, so I texted my husband that we were going to drive back to my Aunt's. A 10 min drive vs. A 1 hour 30 min drive. He never texted back.
Now he is super pissed at me. I can answer questions with more detail,  but this is the gist of it.

Now complete the following example-
input: I hate buying cars from a dealer. But with the poor timing of having a sheet of black ice sentence my beloved Tacoma to a concrete wall, and an upcoming road trip in the next week, I had to get something reliable soon. I settled on a used 2013 Scion xB from the local Subaru dealership. I noticed the front tires were wearing thin, and brought that up during the deal. They said “Nope! We checked them and they’re 70% tread” which they clearly weren’t. But they’re clearly under a third treadlife left. I also noticed the floor mats were not present, but I thought they’d be in the trunk after their detailing like all the previous cars I’ve purchased. After all, the Carfax said “floor mats installed” when the dealership originally took it in on trade. In hindsight I clearly should’ve checked, but mistakenly took their word for it. When all was said and done, I was handed the “key”. Just one. No second fob, no valet key, just one single key. This is a $260 second key from Toyota that I need to get cut and programmed now, and again, I wouldn’t have felt the need to clarify how many keys come with the vehicle during the negotiation. I assumed all the keys would be present. I only discovered the single key issue after the final handshake.  And lastly, for the cherry on top, I found out while they were attaching the paper temp tag that there’s a screw broken off flush in the license plate hole. 

The car has 65,000 miles and I paid just under $10k for the car. Yes, I knew I paid too much. But after all the issues, now I feel like I REALLY paid too much after discovering that some of the basic parts are missing. I am meeting with the “sales manager” tomorrow to discuss my disappointment, but am I the asshole for insisting on compensation for new tires, a second key, and floor mats?

Now complete the following example-
input: My mom and brother are visiting me here and have a 2 bedroom hotel room.  My mom came early and hung out with my 2 kids for the day and checked into the hotel. Its 9:30pm-ish and my mom and kids are waiting for me and my brother to come up to the hotel room.

&amp;#x200B;

So I go and pickup my brother from the airport.  We are both freaking exhausted.  We both had long days.  We get to the hotel elevator, both carrying luggage.  I push the button for the 10th floor and the elevator doesn't move.  I quickly realize you need a room key for the elevator to move.  I start texting my mom to come down, but she's not responding.  I'm pretty sure she's asleep as she has stopped responding to group text awhile back.  So we're both just standing in the elevator.  It's not moving.  

&amp;#x200B;

All of a sudden two girls show up.  Obviously hotel guests.  I'm thinking ""oh we're way lucky.  I'm just going to push the button for the 10th floor after they use their room key to push their room number"".  This scenario has happened like dozens of times in my experience in hotel stays in the past.  

&amp;#x200B;

Right as the girls start walking in, my brother jumps out of the elevator.   

&amp;#x200B;

I'm shocked and say, ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!"" to him.

&amp;#x200B;

He says, ""It's not right.""

&amp;#x200B;

I start trying to convince my brother to get back into the damn elevator.  He's refusing, saying ""it's not right.""  WTF.  I realize the girls are just standing there bewildered, so I start trying to explain the situation to them.  ""Can we please use your room key to get to our room?  My mom....""

&amp;#x200B;

""It's not right.""  My brother interrupts.

&amp;#x200B;

""Uhhhhh…..I'm not comfortable....""  Girl #1 says.  Both girls are staring at me like I'm crazy and about to murder them.  Sigh.  Frustrated and tired, I give up and get out of the elevator.

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my brother start arguing and he's like, ""We can just go to the front desk and get room keys.""

  
""No, we can't.  The room is reserved under mom's name only.  Not ours.  And I'm pretty sure she fell asleep!  We could have just pressed the elevator button right after them without even saying anything!""

&amp;#x200B;

""It's not right.  We cant do that.  It's not rig....""

&amp;#x200B;

Just then, some guy shows up to use the elevator.  I quickly follow him into the elevator, leaving my brother mid sentence as we are arguing.  Surprisingly, my brother quickly follows me into the elevator as well.  I push the 10th floor right after the guy uses his room key.

&amp;#x200B;

We get to the hotel room and of course my mom was asleep!  My son answered the door.

input: So, in middle school, there was this girl i used to pick on because she was fat. I called her horrible names, stole her things, put a picture of her head on the picture of a pig and put it on her locker, and i gave her a nickname that followed her all around school, and was just awful to her. She always ended up crying and she actually transferred to another school (either because of me or her parents just moved. I heard 2 stories.)


Now look, i KNOW I WAS AN ASSHOLE for that. But i was 12 and my family has a very negative view of overweight people. I feel horrible about it. But what i want judgement on is this.


But, i discovered her on Facebook again and she's actually pretty damn hot now. She dropped all her baby fat and has grown up to be quite doable. The only fat on her now is her breasts (seriously, she's, like, an F cup.)


And, i got to thinking. There's something i want to do. I want to add her as a friend and send her a message to ""apologize"". I do feel guilty, but i have somewhat of an ulterior motive. I want to apologize and ask her to meet up for coffee with her. While there, i want to make a move on her. I was thinking i apoligize and start complimenting her on how beautiful she's become and maybe make a move on her. Just rub her leg or something.


I haven't talked to her yet, she probably doesn't even remember me.


Would this be scummy of me? Would i be an asshole if i hit up this girl with the intent of trying to seduce her?

I am richer than my brother who is a socialist and subscribes to the whole ""there shouldn't be billionaires"" mindset.  We got into a lengthy discussion at dinner today about the poor vs rich. I'm well read on political theory and he is not so it was a fact vs emotion argument. I flat out told my brother that he is poor because of our parents I said Jeff Bezos didn't force our parents to give birth to children they couldn't afford, send us to public school, feed us food doused in chemicals and sit us in front of the TV instead of teaching us valuable skills.  Our parents did that and their parents before them did that our entire bloodline is fill with bad parents. I didn't insult anyone, I didn't say it was necessarily my parents fault I said their parents did the same thing they perpetuated the poverty cycle and it's up to someone in our bloodline to make a sacrifice and be a good parent which no one thus far has done. My brother again did not hear it and simply believes in this zero sum game of finance.

Now complete the following example-
input: Throwaway account for privacy reasons.

My little sister committed suicide a year ago. It's been hard and has caused a lot of emotional tension within my family, but we are slowly working through it with therapy and family/grief counseling. My mother and I went to visit my sister's grave yesterday, but we had a last minute guest: her boyfriend.

Though I hesitate to call him her boyfriend for reasons that will soon become apparent, it is true that he was the last person to see her alive. They did mutually care for one another and spent time together, so it wasn't completely out of the ordinary for him to want to come with us on the eve of her passing. 

However, there are a few things that have further soured my already not-great view of him:

* Despite saying how deeply he cared about her, he says that this is the first time that he has visited her grave since her passing. My family has visited several times over the past year, either as a group or individually/in pairs. He had plenty of chances to join us, or even come on his own.
* They ""dated"" for only 4 months, yet says that he ""knew her better than anyone"". He says this in front of a mourning mother and a brother that not only spent a good portion, if not their entire, life with her. Taking her to and from counseling, hospitals, police stations, and so on.
* I say ""dated"" because he convinced her to leave her boyfriend to be with him. He also impregnated her, which she later miscarried. I cannot know for sure if this had any impact on her final decision. 

There are other things that have led me to my negative view of him that I won't get into for the sake of brevity. However, my mother wishes to continue inviting this man into our life and home. I can only assume that this is because he is the last person to see my sister alive. From what I understand, it wasn't anything of note, nothing extraordinary, he was just as shocked as we were. However, given his attitude and his role in my sister's life, I want nothing to do with him and would rather him not bother my family again. I have encouraged my mother to talk to her therapist about this, as I don't want her to become codependent on him. And maybe I'm being paranoid or cynical, but I don't want this guy to try and take advantage of my family.

I'm dreading the next time she invites him into our home because she will see how not-thrilled I am, will ask why, and will invariably becomes upset if I tell the truth because I'm denying her the opportunity to indulge in what I think is something potentially unhealthy. 

I know she misses her daughter. I miss my sister.

Now complete the following example-
input: This happened a while ago, and since then I've thought a lot about it and can't figure out for myself if what I did was right or wrong, as I dont know if it was me being mad I got rejected or her really leading me on.

I was friends with this girl after she broke up with someone I knew (who I am friends with now, but wasn't as much back then) and asked me about the things he was saying about her to our friend group at the time. I tell her some stuff but the conversation quickly turns into us talking about hobbies and stuff, shows we like, etc. Snapchats were exchanged, numbers, and we started talking a lot, and I mean a lot. Within the first few days of having our first conversation. I felt like we had a really good connection and hadn't really felt in the same way with any other girl I'd met before then. We talked frequently for several months, every day and constantly, with both of us reciprocating, she would snapchat or text me right after school got let out, etc. As you can see where this is going, I developed feelings for the girl, and thought it was going really well, until one of her friends told me she liked someone else, which I was like okay, fair enough. I shot my shot not long after that, and got rejected, which I was ok with, we were still good friends. It was at this time I asked if she might ever have feelings for me, as I didnt wan't to be hoping for anything in the future, to which she said she wasn't sure. I was ok with that in the moment, but we kept talking more and more, and I got upset when she asked me to take her to do something and after I said I would, she said she was joking and wasnt being serious, knowing full well that I wasn't (this conversation was done over text btw). I got upset over this and told her I needed a break for a while as I still had feelings and such, and needed to relax, and we agreed. I dated one of my other friends for a couple of months (in which I started talking to the girl again after about a month of not talking, we apologized to each other, etc.) Eventually, me and my girlfriend broke up after a couple of months for reasons not related to the girl, and I found myself drifting back to having feelings for her. This was at the end of the school year at this point, in which we started talking at the very beginning, only not ever talking extensively during the break period. At one point another of her friends told me she was spreading rumours about how I was constantly asking her to do things outside of school, of which I had only done maybe 3 or 4 times max that entire school year, most of the time in a group, and that she was telling people I was desperate (even if it was true, she didnt need to go around telling anyone that). I ended up texting her about this, saying that I had heard what she had said, and that I was upset with her over telling people A. The lies and B. That I was desperate, with me telling her that I was fine being friends with her, and that I wasnt going to make any moves or anything on her at any point. She then asked me why I kept talking to her about my feelings for her (only ever talked about my feelings for her one other time half a year ago when I had asked her out), to which I asked her why shed say something that insulting to me, with us getting into a big argument and her eventually handing the phone to her dad, who just told me to stop texting her, sending a picture of himself from the phone to let me know he has the reigns at this point. I apologized to him and said that it wasn't my intention to hurt her, etc., then blocking her on everything and not talking to her again, even until now.

Now complete the following example-
input: My husband (M28) and I (F26) have been married for 5 years and have been together for about 10/11 years. We have a five year old daughter. He also has an 11 year old son with his ex gf from high school. 

While we were dating, It was always difficult for me to accept that he had a son with another woman because it made me feel really insecure. They were on bad terms for some time but I asked him to call her so he can see his son and try to connect with him. Even thou he and his ex are not together he has gone to her house to visit them every Sunday for a few hours. Although I felt very insecure about it, I was the one to encourage him to go see him. I grew up with out a dad so I didn’t think it would be fair that I let my jealousy get the best of me try to keep a child from having a dad.  

Once we got married, I made a promise to myself and decided to get over my irrational insecurities and try to become friends with his ex. It was a slow process on my part because I felt very uncomfortable going to visit them, I felt like a complete out cast and I felt very stupid. She was actually very friendly and we became somewhat friends. We don’t call each other every weekend or hang out often, but when I do I go over her house I feel very comfortable hanging out and drinking and dancing. We really do have a good time with her best friend and her siblings and I also truly enjoy hanging out with his son. 

He took that comfort and friendship away from me, she is very close to her siblings and best friend so I know she discussed these texts with them. I no longer feel like I can look at any of them in the face. I’m just so hurt.

He made my biggest insecurities come true. This wasn’t a random girl from the internet. This is a woman that he has a child with and that I was very jealous about for years. We built a friendship but it took years of hard work to feel like I could let my guard down. She didn’t respond to his texts and did not lead him on, I really do appreciate her and respect her as a woman. But I just can’t look at her or go to her house. She isn’t the problem, it’s my husband I know but it’s still very hard. 

Since we got married and I became friends with his ex, I always felt very safe and secure with my relationship. We absolutely love our daughter and we get along so well. I have been faithful and so has he, so we have never had a reason to not trust each other so I’m completely shocked by this. I just don’t feel safe anymore, I feel alone. He was the one person I could call and count on. I feel like he robbed me of a friend, which is him. It probably sounds stupid but I feel like he isn’t my friend anymore. 

His excuse is that he is an idiot, but that it wasn’t a big deal since nothing happened. When I confronted him he tried to say it wasn’t him and denied it. Nothing happened because his ex respected me enough as a friend and woman to not cross the line, or betray me behind my back. He didn’t even apologize until the third day and that’s only because I told him he hasn’t even sorry.   I just feel as if he is so selfish. 

I feel like he doesn’t understand what he he took from me, how much my relationship with her meant. 

Am I the asshole for wanting him to leave our apartment? I have also been looking in to divorce but don’t know if I am overreacting. 

He didn’t physically cheat on me, but I can’t help feeling emotionally disturbed. I have been crying since I found out. He doesn’t want me, he doesn’t respect me. He wants to have sex with other people. He is asking other people for nudes. I feel like he has taken advantage of me. I work a full time job, I take care of our daughter and her needs 95% of the time. I do his laundry and always have food made for him to eat. I try so hard to make his life easier. I do all the cleaning, I handle paying all the bills.  I feel so dumb for trying so hard. 

I’m so confused, like how long has he been doing this behind my back? I have never snooped his phones or checked his call or anything , I have completely trusted his word and give him his space. I am feeling very stupid right now. 

I just feel like I lost respect for him, we are very open with each other and have agreed to tell one another if we ever loose interest or are attracted to someone else because we should at least have that respect for one another and not cheat. But he didn’t tell me. I happened to open our laptop and the messages started coming in and the text was displayed so I read his texts asking for sex and nudes. If I hadn’t opened the lap top I would have never known, and he would have never told me.

Am I the asshole for asking for a divorce and asking him to move out?

Please shed some light on the situation because I can’t. I’m just so hurt

Now complete the following example-
input: So this guy (I'll call him A) was a super close friend of mine as a kid, but as adults we've vastly grown apart. Since we left high school 4 years ago, we've literally only spent time together once, and only keep in touch on social media. We don't speak all that often and when we do speak, it's incredibly forced. We have nothing in common and it's just really awkward. I've also noticed an undertone of racism in some of what he says to me sometimes - I'm Muslim and South Asian, he's white. For example, after the Manchester arena terror attack he sent me some messages basically asking which side I was on, as if he thought it was possible I'd side with the terrorist. That's not the only low-key racist conversation but it's the worst one and the one I remember most clearly. 


The other layer to this is that, A is just really not a great person, morally. He's got some kind of addiction to affairs I guess, in that he exclusively sleeps with/dates married people. He's ruined several marriages, including ones where kids were involved. His current girlfriend, who I'll call R, was married when they met. R's husband went away on a business trip, and when he came home all of his things were in boxes and A was living in his house. Since R owned the house, her husband couldn't argue and just had to leave. 


In his affair with R, and in ones before it, he's always told me about it in such explicit detail, as if he's bragging that he can get married women. He mainly comes to me for validation. He tells me why he's justified in his affairs, and gets angry at me if I tell him I think he's wrong. Hearing about what he was doing to these people really affected me to be honest, cos it was just so immoral. One of his past ""girlfriends"" was the wife of his close friend, and their kids were his godchildren, and he would use babysitting the godchildren as an excuse to be in their home and sleep with his friends wife. The affair ruined that marriage and those little kids lives. 


Anyway, the AITA part is: I'm just really tired of A. He's become someone I don't align with morally, and we really don't have that friendship connection anymore anyway. But he keeps pushing it. He's been talking about me meeting R for a while now, as if we're still really close and I *have* to meet his girlfriend. I feel awkward and don't want to flat out say no because that makes me feel rude, but I don't really feel like spending time with them considering what they did to R's husband. I really honestly don't get why he keeps forcing the friendship; it's blatantly obvious that we have nothing at all in common and aren't close anymore. 


At the same time though, dropping him makes me feel bad. I went through some tough patches with mental health in high school and he was the only person who stuck by me, so I feel like I owe him some loyalty in our friendship. 


In summary, we aren't really compatible friends, we're different people, and when we do speak he tells me about things that I just can't side with him on, but gets angry with me if I don't validate his shitty behaviour. If the world was perfect, I think we would just slowly drift into our separate lives. But he's adamantly keeping in touch and keeps trying to make plans with me. AITA if I turn all these plans down and dry-reply him til the friendship fades out?

Now complete the following example-
input: My fiance's brother is getting married in September. They decided to not allow kids at anything. The wedding is 3-5 hrs from everyone except the bride's parents. My fiance's sister has 3 kids, expressed she was upset, and brother made an exception for her kids. 

I have a 3 year old son with another woman, and we are in the middle of a custody battle. I currently get him about 30% of the time. To keep it short, in past occasions when we have switched dates, she has backed out and kept my son even when I was supposed to have him. The future is very unsure, as she is trying to move across the country with him. 

I do not want to change my time with my son.
- As mentioned before, I have limited time with him.
- I've been screwed out of time in past when switching time.
- In the last 2 years I've asked to switch maybe once or twice, and I've tried to have the appearance that my time with him is my #1 priority, so giving up the weekend if she wouldn't switch isn't an option in my mind.

My fiance expressed the situation and my thoughts to her brother once she found out he was letting her sister's kids go because she has never had anyone other than the grandparents watch the kids. He replied that it's a firm rule. When she told him I wouldn't be able to come, he replied with, ""I'm sure you could figure out something, but that's your choice. You guys aren't married yet and I've only met his kid once.""

My fiance is upset at her brother, but also upset at me, saying I'm being too stubborn.

For the record, if people don't want kids, so be it. But if that's the case I don't think they should be upset when people decline because of it.

Now complete the following example-
input: Ok, this one requires a little back story so bare with me...

A few years ago my ex and I had broken up. I admit that I was to blame, I made a lot of mistakes &amp; it was just hard for us to work through them. I hadn't even moved my stuff out of my ex's apartment and we were still talking frequently. Out of nowhere, I began to get messages from someone I didn't know and it turns out it was my ex's new SO. They began to threaten me and insult my mother &amp; siblings, demanding I move my stuff out of my ex's apartment or they'd throw it out on the street. I just want to note that at no time did my ex tell me they needed my stuff gone now and when I tried to confront my ex about this, their new SO would just threaten me again.

In hindsight I probably should have gotten a restraining order, but everything was such a whirlwind, I just grabbed my things and couch surfed at my friends' apartment. Never really spoke to my ex again but still felt a lot of pain &amp; resentment from the way I was treated, regardless of my mistakes.

Fast forward to about a year later. I have a group of close knit friends that have been together since high school and we often hung out on weekends. At one point I had lived with almost everyone in the group &amp; at one point one of them even lived with me and my ex. So we were pretty close.

There was one particular weekend when I asked everyone what they were up to &amp; they all said they were busy. I couldn't get many details and they avoided providing any info. I tried not to think too much of it until the next day I see all of the social media photos of most of them hanging out with my ex &amp; the SO that threatened me. I will admit - I saw red. Most of them knew what had happened since I had at one point slept on the couches because of it &amp; I get that they wanted to see my ex, but to see them laughing and having beers with this person who made my life hell? I couldn't take it.

I got angry and hurt and began to just avoid them. I didn't know how to deal with the situation and instead of getting in a fight, chose to avoid conflict. About a month passed and I finally began to feel like I could get over what happened and went to a party everyone was at. I couldn't have guessed the way many of them would act. All I wanted to do was move on but I was instead faced with these ""friends"" telling me that I was the one in the wrong &amp; being immature and not a good friend. They got in my face, yelled at me &amp; I asked them to just let it go but they wouldn't. They essentially blamed me for the situation because of my difficulty with expressing my emotion &amp; for not being great to my ex.

Before things got any more heated I decided to just leave the party and since then some of these ""friends"" have told everyone that they would not go to any get togethers or parties I was at. And in return my ""friends"" who were less involved in this fight, or whatever you want to call, have told me it's probably better if they don't invite me anymore so to avoid drama.

Now complete the following example-
input: So me and my gf at the time had been together for about 2 months. Around this time I was moving places and had very few belongings (just the stuff i used regularly). She insisted I took her 45inch TV that he hadnt been using for years and bought 8 years ago. I kindly rejected the offer several times knowing I wouldn't use it as I never watch tv/movies but shes the type that doesn't take no for an answer so eventually I moved it into my house. About 1 month later we broke up and broke off any contact we had with each other. Fast forward 4 months and she randomly texted me one night asking if she could pick up her TV the following day to which I told her I gave away to someone online who would actually use it. She was surprised and proceeded to claim that I owe her $1200 for the TV(the price she bought it for 8 years ago). I told her that the tv was worth no more than $100 and that she shouldn't be surprised I gave it to someone else because I told her I would never use it and she basically forced me to take it from her in the first place. 

TLDR; ex gf of 3 months texts me 4 months after break up to get back her TV that she forcibly gifted to me. I told her that I gave it away and she claims I owe her $1200 for what the TV was worth when she bought it 8 years ago.

input: I've known this friend since freshman year of high school, and I'm about to graduate. We started being friends at the end of the school's summer program, and ever since she's been sitting at lunch with me and all my free periods. It was nice at first, because she always wanted to hang out and help me out with schoolwork (of course, i helped her too.) However, she started becoming for of a nuisance than an eager friend. She would drag me to places when I have to study, and talk about anything and everything whenever I tried to do work. It seemed as if no was never an option. Due to my horrible temper, I've shown my annoyance multiple times. We've already fought recently, because I tried to apologize for my behavior and she then told me she never cared and thought it was funny to see how annoyed I could get.
After that fight, I blocked her on every social media platform and on my contacts. She then texted my boyfriend, who had to basically play messenger for two weeks. She couldn't take a hint and even sat with me as if nothing was wrong. This happened until Halloween, when she gave me a stuffed animal and refused to take it back. I did not ask for the gift, or her ""apology"", yet she believes that I have. My other friend tells me to just tell her flat out, but I still feel guilty. On the other hand, seeing her just ruins my day and I immediately feel like screaming. AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: So this happened a few years ago in tenth grade, I'm a sophomore in college now, but it's always been in my head because it really ruined my longest friendship, and I keep switching sides on whether or not I'm the asshole. So this kid, Jon let's call him, was the same age as me, same male gender, and we had been friends since I moved schools in the 3rd grade. He's over one night on a weekend and we were having a good time as usual, and I show him a video I saw earlier that I thought was HILARIOUS. It was that grapefruit-job tutorial video that was pretty viral on you-tube, which I'll link at the bottom of this post. Now I still think this video is amazing and yea maybe it's a little nsfw but it's no big deal I think. Anyways, with him and I in my room (we were not alone in the house my parents and siblings were downstairs), I show him the video on my laptop. I am dying from laughter and, from what I could tell, so was Jon! As soon as the video gets past the ""GWORSCH GWORSCH GWORSCH"" part, he leaves the room, comes back, and we start talking about other stuff, except now he is totally expressionless. He's hardly talking and definitely not laughing. I asked him what's wrong and he just said that he was leaving. A few minutes of awkward silence after his mom comes and picks him up just like that. I thought it was weird but I pretty much forgot about it. About a week later (we went to different high schools so I hadn't had a chance to see him again), my mom calls me to her room and when I see her face she is completely livid. She starts shouting and yelling at how I'm a terrible friend and that I've changed and all this crazy stuff that I was completely clueless to. She then tells me that Jon told his mom that I showed him porn. I was MORTIFIED at this because my fairly strict parents were, to say the least, not very approving of anything remotely sex related. Tears and arguments later, I show her the video, and her exact reaction was ""Oh, that's what it was? Oh okay.""  And boom that was that. For whatever reason, probably because it was raunchily comedic rather than actually sexual, the video didn't set off the whole ""THIS IS SEX"" trigger that would have led to her berating me for living a bad lifestyle, but that's besides the point.  I felt betrayed by my friend, and we didn't contact each other for a few weeks. Finally, I text him and his responses are all at most two-words until he plain stops responding. Aaaand that was that. In the past few years we've seen each other every now and then since we're in similar communities and we don't greet each other.

&amp;#x200B;

So I never apologized for showing him that video because I didn't feel I needed to. After it was too late to apologize though, I did begin to feel bad. I mean, a kid in tenth grade is totally in his right to feel uncomfortable and leave! It was probably an asshole thing to show him an explicit video when, looking back at it, I had never shown him anything like that before. But still, to tell his mom and, as a result, my mom that I showed him porn? First off, it just was not porn. Second, isn't there a code in high school that clearly states you should keep those talks secret from parents anyways? And third, it made feel like I was some pervert or sex offender for showing someone ""porn,"" which is a real crappy and demeaning feeling. 

So, am I the asshole? Should I have at least apologized to save the really long term and close friendship?

Now complete the following example-
input: I’ve had a good friend for about 2.5 years now and she’s always been sort of into her Instagram. She’s smart and kind, but also socially anxious and pretty self-centered. Like not selfish, just self-centered. I unfollowed her Instagram recently and got confronted on it. 


The last year or two she has gotten more into the Instagram and into this idea of being an influencer and into her “aesthetic”. All with this light pink filter into this very ideal life of hers that frankly isn’t that accurate. She probably spends about 3-4 hours a day on it easily. She follows about 5000 accounts and has around 6000 followers. More than that, the amount of her mental energy that goes towards it is pretty bizarre to me. I don’t spend much time at all on Instagram and basically only follow friends. 


About 6 months ago she made a smaller private account for just friends and she posts more stuff from parties or personal insights into her life. I’m quite a bit more comfortable with that and it’s not that fake. 


I unfollowed her main account a couple of days ago because I would get a weird feeling seeing it. That it’s just not real and how much time goes into these pretty fake posts. I didn’t feel a need to follow it either, as I can see her day to day on the other one. 


She confronted me about it in the most non confrontational way today, with a couple long DMs. I had said that I preferred to follow her other one because t was the friend I knew and loved. She went off about how it upset her because it’s something she’s passionate about that people don’t accept and wishes people would be more supportive of her hobby. And she says I don’t have to look at it all of the time, which is true, the amount that it bothers me is not greater than our friendship or anything. 


I do see how she feels, and I’m not sure if it means I’m unsupportive as she says I am. 


Yeah. I know it all sounds small and petty, especially given the subject matter, but I do take friendship pretty seriously, especially as Im getting older and don’t see these friends as much in person. Thanks for reading through this, it’s a bugs life.

Now complete the following example-
input: Recently one of my friend's girlfriends came to town and a few of us went out to hang out and get drinks, note that this friend does not live in my town, so he was not present at this hangout. I will call this friend the 'boyfriend' and his girlfriend just the 'girlfriend'.

During this hangout, we spent some time sharing stories about the boyfriend, most of which were fun but also listening to her complain a bit about different fights and such. At one point in the conversation, the girlfriend asks us if we know about the one time the boyfriend had sex previous to their relationship (at this point she had enough to drink to be pretty unfiltered). The boyfriend had told a couple of us the story before, and it occurring when he had traveled to NYC.

Initially I had assumed the girlfriend was just trying to get us to bait information out of us, but when she referenced NYC I thought perhaps the boyfriend had told her about it before. When I replied that I knew exactly what she was talking about, she didn't believe me and I replied that it was with 'Alice'. Apparently the boyfriend had told the girlfriend a different story about who he had slept with in NYC, due to his history with Alice.

This resulted in her confronting him, them getting in a big fight, and him angrily messaging me calling me a liar and ultimately blocking me. The girlfriend messaged me as well, apologizing, and explained this was a big issue due to him lying about big things like this in the past.

Am I the asshole here? I feel very guilty as it feels like I am causing them to potentially break up. I am fully aware that perhaps we shouldn't have been talking about that subject at all, but the atmosphere at the time seemed like telling funny stories rather than gossiping, and at the time I genuinely thought we were both referencing the same story.

TL;DR: Accidentally exposed friend's conflicting story to his girlfriend resulting in a fight between them, AITA?

input: A little background, my fiance (28F) and I (30M) got engaged 6 months ago and I love her very much and I know how much they want a very large traditional wedding. I also love my 12 year old pup just as much who without going into too much detail has been plagued with ill health recently causing me to play over $1500 just last year. 

&amp;#x200B;

My fiance really wants us to be married in the same church her parents got married, however the place over the years has grown very popular causing the price of the ceremony there to be well over budget. When I suggested we got married somewhere cheaper but still nice saying ""the place may not be where you wanted but it will still be special to us"" she began to cry before very aggressively suggesting I should ""let my damn dog die in peace"" to afford her dream wedding. Although I try to be discreet about the amount I spend on my dog she must have found out somehow and it will not get any cheaper soon.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly find her words very hurtful and what I thought was just a snarky remark said in the heat of the moment has since become the topic of many hostile debates. She can't see that I'm not choosing my dog over her but i'm creating a compromise so that my beloved pet can continue his happy life for as long as possible. He is not in any visible pain, just has seen better days and although I hate to make my fiance sad I will stand by my choice.

input: I'm slightly exaggerating here but hear me out please. Kitty is well taken care of - regular vet checkups, toys and playtime, cuddles, dry food with a snack every once in a while (rice, tiny bits of cooked chicken/fish without (fish) bones), but when it comes to being let in our (tiny) garden, he can be a bit of a twat. 

The second I let him outside, he keeps an eye on the door and if he sees me closing it again, he comes rushing right at it to be let in again. If I let him in, he starts loudly meowing and pawing at the door to be let out again. 
It's been very windy the last few weeks and I understand he wants to be inside if outside scares him, but getting up every 2 minutes to let him in, let him out again is a bit annoying if he does it every damn time -_- 

We don't have a cat door atm. We're going to look for some renovations and a new garden door, along with a (lockable) cat door is among our priorities. We don't want him to go out at night, but at the moment we're like, ""going outside means staying outside for a while"", not changing your mind the second he goes outside. Building character, a bit?
I let him in if he looks like he want to be let in *urgently* but not when he simply sits down and meows if he's not even been two minutes outside. 

Since it's a cat, and not a human being though, I'm wondering if I'm being an ass. 
Judgement please, let it rain down on me.

Now complete the following example-
input: I created this Throwaway account so my friends don’t find out about my family issues on Reddit. This is one complicated shitstorm that has 14 years’ worth of back story so I’ll try my best to give you a brief and unbiased perspective.

This all started 14 years ago when my parents and I lived in a small city. We were told that my aunt suddenly passed away due to mental issues and misdiagnosis one day and my uncle was a complete emotional wreck and was in no state to take care of his 6 yrs old child ( I’ll call him Aaron). Our relatives and my uncle wanted to us move cities take care of my cousin Aaron, because my uncle works in middle east and comes back home only once a year. It was a mutually beneficial for both of us. My mom always wanted the best opportunities for me and moving to a bigger city means that she’ll be able to provide them all and at same time she’ll be able to take care of Aaron and bring him up like her own son.

In the beginning everything was good. My mom and dad are very strict about discipline and manners, but I’ve never seen them treat me favorably over him or vice versa. We got our asses whooped equally and treated to an ice-cream equally. But I could see something was off with my brother Aaron as he approached puberty. When he was 12 yrs. old my neighbor caught peeping through a keyhole when my mom was changing and another time my driver caught him peeping again when he was 14 yrs. old. He was creepy and started getting more and more aggressive and my mom said even his hugs were very inappropriate, but she still in my opinion treated us as equals.

Thing went out of control when Aaron started spiraling into some mental issues like OCD and Depression, and his father (My uncle) had to leave his job in the middle east due to Arab spring that sent the country spiraling through a bloody civil war. He is really nice man but the trauma of losing his wife led him to pamper him and silently enable him in being absolutely disrespectful and degrading to my parents. He would treat my mom like a servant and would threaten violence against my father if he was angry. My parents decided to bear through this humiliation because I was in high school and they didn’t want to me to lose out on the best opportunities because of this asshole.

Fast forward now 5 year later, I’m a 23 yrs. Old and I was able to follow my passion and graduate from a great college just like my parents hoped and I’m now employed in a different city with a decently well-paying job with enough income to support my standard of living without any financial issues. I have to mention that my parents completely funded my entire college expenses including monthly allowances. But, things at home have gotten worse. Aaron is increasing spiraling and going out of control and orders around my parents and treats them very disrespectfully. My parents especially my mom has grown to hate him and has started actively showing her displeasure. My father works as a government bureaucrat and he’s waiting for his promotion so my parents can move out of this shitshow but unfortunately due national politics and election his promotion has been delayed by 6 months. My Brother’s mental health has also steadily deteriorated, he doesn’t take his meds properly and my uncle has pampered him.

My mom calls me every day and cries to me about how she gets treated and horrible my brother behaves. I feel really helpless because she doesn’t want to leave my father alone and at the same time can’t stand living there. Its horrible hearing my mom cry and I feel absolutely distraught that I can’t do anything to help her. Today I snapped and told her off, I told her to not talk to me about this and asked her to leave me alone. She says she just wants to vent to someone she can trust (like me) but I’m an introvert and have difficulty processing emotions’, I just want to left alone. I hate feeling helpless and this is taking an emotional toll on me. She blames me for being selfish and self-centered after all she’s done for me and provided me with the best opportunities even going above and beyond in some cases. AITA the asshole here?

TL;DR : My parents are going through hell because of my abusive and disrespectful brother (who’s going through some mental issues), but can’t move out due to some external issues like national politics. My mom cries to me every day as a way of venting but today I snapped at her and told her to stop talking to me about this issue because I feel helpless and seeing her cry and vent out to me is taking an emotional toll on me. AITA the asshole here?

input: I live with 3 other people and we all share a washing machine. One housemate always puts on a load and leaves it sitting for a few days so usually i take it out and put it in a basket and leave it in the laundry. This is starting to get really annoying. It is only a little thing but it is just so lazy and it's annoying having to removed their mouldy/damp smelling washing every time i want use the machine...my other housemates agree. Sometimes the clothes are just sitting in the laundry in the basket for two weeks and it just piles up. We have discussed this but they seem very dismissive of the whole thing, say they will be more conscious but never are.

Anyway, I again go to find washing in the machine. I have had enough and I can't be be bothered nor do i have time to find a basket for them. So I just chuck it on the floor and put my washing on...cue a huge rant on our household group chat about how rude I am and how disrespectful it is to chuck someones clothes on the floor...I'm just sick of it.

Now complete the following example-
input: *tldr at end. Throwaway acct bc I just don't want this on my main.*

&amp;#x200B;

Title sounds bad, but basically I(16F) don't love my dad. Let's start with background on that.

My mom and dad met, mom got pregnant with my sister, they married. Had my other sister and me. Somewhere along that time my dad got addicted to drugs and alcohol, and it escalated to restraining orders, daily fights when he still came by etc. Eventually when I was 2, he came by and ended up locking us in the house and lighting it on fire.

We're all fine, house burns down though. Dad is arrested and sent to prison. Mom and him get divorced and he loses visitation rights/other parental rights. In that time my mom had to move from Michigan to Ohio(4 hours) for a job, and that's where I grew up.

My dad sent letters, called, and we visited him twice in prison, and both times I don't remember. So I basically grew up with him barely in my life until around age 12(I think) when he got released.

We visit him occasionally, but the 4 hours distance can be hard to work around school/activities/etc. Still, we see him in the summer and some holidays. About 3-5 times a year, from a couple days to a month long. It was somewhere along this arrangement that I realized I didn't love him. It isn't that I hate him, I just never was able to build a connection and now it just seems we are living different lives in different places.

My sisters get on my case about it(""he's our dad you have to love him"") but whatever. What I'm here about is... AITA for not being honest with it?

I always say I love him back, hug him, smile, basically just act happy and loving to all his typical dad advances. I only do it in response to his actions, otherwise I just treat him like any other teenager to adult would. Still, as far as he knows I'm still his ""baby girl"" and he's still my dad beyond just blood. I haven't told him about not loving him/my lack of any real connection and how building one now seems impossible. Honestly, I don't know if I ever will tell him.

AITA for doing this despite knowing my true feelings? Or am I not since telling him wouldn't be really necessary with how little I see him currently.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: Dad went to prison when I was 2, grew up without him in my life much, now live 4 hours away and rarely see him. I don't love him, but act like I do. AITA for not being honest about it?

Now complete the following example-
input: So last night, we all went out with friends. I was fully ready to pay for my meal, which was wings. I ordered a side fries because I thought everything came with fries, but it ended up being an extra $2.99. He offered to pay for my meal and I told him what I ordered and he seemed okay. I ordered another beer and told him I’ll pay for that one (has a fun and tonic and a beer in total). Then a while later he says “why don’t you pay for your own meal. Didn’t think you’d order all this stuff” (literally fries and a beer). I got upset at the table, like I was just quiet and wasn’t smiling much, just drank my beer. He got mad at me when I told him why I was upset. Fast forward, we talked it out and everything seemed fine. I looked at the bill and asked him what I owe him, and he said “don’t worry about it”. WHAT THE FUCK. Then he gets MAD at me and won’t say he loved me when I told him goodnight. I gave him every opportunity to let me pay!!! And now he’s still upset with me, the next day, that I “expect” him to pay. Which I never did, but I think it’s rude to offer to pay and then just retract your offer and get mad at the person when they get upset. I offered to pay for the extra things but he still got mad!! It’s $12 more which I was fine with paying. Not only that, he left a hefty tip and the bill came to $80, and he expects me to pay $40. I was never even discussed the tip amount. I literally am broke after buying him things for Christmas, his birthday and Valentine’s Day and he knows that. Am I the asshole for being upset??

Now complete the following example-
input: My son is five. He’s going through something. A stage in identity development, my wife calls it. His sister is seven and he’s taken to wearing her old clothes. Thus far, this has been largely confined to the house. However, on Halloween last year we decided to be more lenient and let him go as a unicorn, which was a somewhat feminine costume, but not quite drag either. 

I would say the whole dress up thing has been going on since he was three (so only like two years).

Anyway this coming holiday we’re all dressing up, which is pretty normal in my family (when we do Christmas celebrations with my wife’s parents, it’s more lax so outfits aren’t as big a concern). My daughter is wearing a pretty elaborate, puffy red dress that looks like what the pageant kids wear (slightly over the top, but my wife picked it). 

My son saw my daughter’s dress and for whatever reason became obsessed with wearing something similar. I have no idea why he’s so fixated on this but he’s managed to wear my wife down to the point where she thinks we should just let him wear a dress. 

I am personally unwilling to let my son’s outfit be the main point of discussion on Christmas Eve (and it would be). I put my foot down and said that this just isn’t the time for this sort of experimentation. He doesn’t necessarily have to wear a little suit, but it’s not going to be a dress either. 

I figured I would make it known several days in advance to avoid a meltdown the day of. My son became hysterical and it didn’t go over well with my wife. She thinks I should just let it go but she also is a fairly passive, unargumentative person so I don’t see her fighting me on it either. 

Look, I am not trying to be the villain in this scenario. I just think that the holidays aren’t the right time for this sort of thing. Christmas Eve comes once a year and I want it to be drama and spectacle-free. Does that make me the a-hole, Grinch in this situation?

Now complete the following example-
input: Last fall when I moved to a new city, I joined a new gym and decided to get a personal trainer. Our initial session went really well, so I decided to take the leap and buy her 10x package (yes yes, my mistake).

Fast forward a few months, I have 4 sessions left (I was sick for like a month and there’s been holidays in between) and I just don’t want to do it anymore. I’ve found a good gym routine on my own, plus taken up a sport so I get a good amount of exercise in my free time, and simply put I just don’t really enjoy her training style. The first few times were nice because I learned new things etc, but at this point I never feel like going, and I kind of feel like I’m wasting both of our times. 

The only issue is I still have those 4 paid for sessions, so I’m worried it would be a slap in the face to her to virtually be like “I’d rather throw this money away than train with you”. Furthermore, I genuinely have to cancel/move next week’s session due to something coming up, so I’m worried that would be like a double whammy. She’s really nice and it’s nothing against her as a person, it’s just not working for me. So, Reddit, WIBTA if I told her I want to stop?

TL;DR: Bought a 10 session packet with my personal trainer. I’m not enjoying it and don’t feel like I’m getting much out of it, so I want to stop going, but I have 4 paid for sessions left and am worried how it would come off to stop seeing her when she knows it means throwing money away. WIBTA if I end it anyway?

So I'm working overtime today and the team suddenly decides to get pizza and chicken. We chipped in with whatever we're comfortable with, but we come up short so I decided to double my share out of my own accord because I can afford it, it's been a while since we last shared a meal together too. The whole time my colleagues teased this guy for giving the lowest possible amount and challenged him to match mine. He mentioned he doesn't have cash on him, and we still end up with the required amount to go ahead with it.

He later sent me a message and offered to give me back half my share tomorrow. I thanked him but declined the offer, and suggested to offer the money to another colleagues who shouldered most of it or to our boss who'll prolly divide it between whoever wants it but he kept on insisting I take it instead, over and over. I got angry and just stood my ground and replied back with ""I don't want the money. Stop being pushy."" BTW this person likes me, and he's been guilty of being a niceguyTM in the past. I know I shouldn't question his motives but it feels like an attempt to earn brownie points from a specific person, which is me.

I'll definitely apologise if I'm the asshole.

After she told me this story I made her tell me like 3 times so I understood everything and its exactly what I described above, I then sadly told her that wasn't sexual assault and if anything she sexually assaulted him because he was KO'D and she noticed he was and still got his dick out and blew him. She got so mad at me and said it was a few of her friends said it was etc. She stormed off and hasn't spoke to me since.

Now complete the following example-
input: My brother is a heroin addict. It started with pain pills and evolved from there. 

I have given him thousands of dollars in the form of bail, flights to go get “treatment,” Lyfts and Ubers because he lost his license for a while.....you get the picture. He also completely ruined my credit after I co-signed a car loan for him and he allowed the car to get repossessed. I didn’t find out about it until I went to renew the lease on my own car. That was fun. 

Well he was down in Florida until last night staying with my father. He was supposed to seek treatment down there and maybe possibly find a job. He has an in demand skill (HVAC technician) however he can’t find a job because his driving record is so awful that no company will trust him with a company vehicle. He has no home and is totally broke. His drug dealers are also looking for him because he owes them money (however I’m *pretty* sure they don’t know that I exist, but they have called my mom as well as his ex girlfriend looking for him). 

My father is a complete and total asshole and I’m not going to get into that however despite all of this, I can understand why he would want to come back up here (New Jersey). The biggest reason being that he has a son here. 

Well he stayed with me last night and swore that he was going to be entering a sober living home today. 

I just got a message from my mother asking me if my brother is staying with me again tonight. I said no because I thought it was only for one night. She said that he doesn’t have the $600 deposit needed to stay at the sober living home but that he *should* be getting paid tomorrow. I told my mom that he’s not staying with me. I was told it was one night and already that’s turning into two. I feel like if I say yes, that’s going to turn into three nights, then four and on and on. 

The guilt of saying no is eating me alive. However not only am I tired of being an enabler, but I have roommates and as gracious as they were about him staying last night, I can’t ask them to keep doing it. Especially knowing what I know about his drug dealers. 

My husband is currently living in another state. I’m moving there too in a few months and finally getting away from all of this but for right now, my main support system is gone. 

I’ve cried so much about all of this that I busted a capillary under my eye.

Now complete the following example-
input: I have 4 siblings and I am the second oldest. Our ages are 26, 23, 21, 15, and 13. My sister recently told me her boyfriend is planning to ask my siblings and I for our blessing before he asks our dad. My 21 year old sibling and I told her 'no', and my other siblings didn't really care. Our other siblings don't know this so maybe that's why they don't really care, but the reason we say 'no' is because he has cheated on her 3 times (that we know of) and has beat her to the point where she needed stitches. We suspect she's been beaten more times because of random bruises, but this was the only time she needed/decided to go to the ED. My parents know none of this.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister and her boyfriend have been together for \~5 years? He yells at her when she comes home late after hanging out with US at OUR PARENTS house, doesn't allow her to hang out with her friends (if she does, he has to tag along), doesn't help her care for their animals, never comes to our family gatherings (even before we didn't like him), made them get a shared bank account, didn't help her pay for her tuition which was $600 so she asked me and my boyfriend, cheated on her, beat(s) her, and is an alcoholic who has been trying to sober up since year 2 of their relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our parents have been married since forever and have instilled in us what a healthy relationship should look like. My dad has never hit my mom and he treats us all like princesses and a prince. My sister's boyfriend though... The way he treats her is physically and mentally abusive, yet she can't see it or refuses to believe it. I love her so much and I want her to be happy, but I don't want her to marry a ""man"" who treats her like that. I really can't see myself giving her boyfriend my blessing, but if he makes her happy, then would I be wrong not to?

Now complete the following example-
input: I have known my friend for 10 years now (and dated at one point but broke it off mutually) so I know a lot about his life. He is a nice person, but in my opinion, is a complete pushover. He is 25 years old, has stable job, and earns a decent amount. Since the time that I have known him, he has been completely devoted to his parents, to the point that they can do no wrong. His parents are immigrants from India (as are mine) and he feels that they have sacrificed a lot for him to come to this country, get him a private elementary school education and paid for part of his college (which was mostly paid for by scholarships, his parents paid for around 20k). 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, he lives at home with his parents and pays for the electricity &amp; phone bills and monthly payments for a leased car (they all share one car). He saved up around 80k and his parents saved up around 20k to put a down payment for a house together. All of that is fine and all, but here's the problem: his parents have exhibited behavior that goes outside of normal Indian parent expectations, in my opinion. When they decided to get a new car, his father consistently complained about any of the cheaper models, and they ended up getting a more expensive one. Alongside that, the parents consistently disliked the houses within the realistic budget that he set and they ended up being adamant about one particular house that was way over budget. These are the two main things, but there are lots of little things I picked up on over the years about them hinting at wanting a certain phones, complaining about gifts, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my  problem is, my friend comes complaining to me all the time about such things. He always laments that he wishes he had richer parents, that he's jealous of our mutual friends who have no real responsibilities, that he wishes he could just be young and carefree. I have always tried to be supportive, but at the same time, I always say things like it is. Today, I kind of said fuck it and ended up telling him that his parents are being selfish by wanting a more expensive house, fully knowing that within 5 years or so, he will be footing the mortgage payments. I also said that his parents should've tried harder to save more money over the last 16 years that they have been here instead of expecting so much out of their son. I also said that he should pick one or the other: be a completely doting son and do what he feels like he needs to do...or, do some things for his parents but also think about saving for his own future. 

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say, he got mad at me. I know what I was definitely harsh (especially calling his parents ""selfish"") but I really was tired of the same recycling of him coming to me to complain about his responsibilities but never putting his foot down in front of his parents. So am I the asshole and do I owe him an apology now?

input: AITA for not watching my Mom's girlfriend grandchildren?

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a house with my mother, her girlfriend, my younger brother and sister, and my mother's girlfriend two kids. We're all over 18 and we all work while we attend school. My mother and I have two dogs from before she began a relationship with her girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, some days I work and have classes and I don't get home until late evening. No one takes care of the dogs while I'm at work or in my classes. I have begged and asked that they take them outside and make sure they have food and water. They say they'll do it and I come home to find that they have eliminated in their crates and they're bowls empty. To sum it up, I'm gone from 7am to 9pm on days I work (At most three days a week) and they leave the dogs in their crates the entire time. I did get into a big argument with my younger siblings and my mother's girlfriend children after I came home one day to find that someone had pushed their crates into closets because they were whining to be let out. I recently got my part time job hours reduced to focus better in my classes and be more available for my dog. Now when I have a long day ahead, I take them to a Dog daycare that I have to pay for since 'I'm just overreacting'.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, my mom's girlfriend has taken partial custody of her grandchildren from her other daughter who does not live with us. The grandchildren are 2 and 4. I was asked to watch them since I was at home more often and said no. If they aren't going to watch my dogs while I'm gone, I'm not going to watch your grandchildren/nephews.

&amp;#x200B;

They've (my mom girlfriend's kids) tried to start having to leave while I'm there to do something and leaving the grandchildren with me thereby leaving me to watch them. I still refused and told them if they have something to do, they need to either take them with them or drop them off at a daycare, because I'm not watching them.

TLDR

I'm not watching your nephews when you locked my dogs in closets for 12+ hours. AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: Hey all,

So this is pretty short. It was snowing when I got home last night, and I realized my neighbor’s windshield wipers were down. My neighbor and I share a driveway, so we park right to each other. I put mine up to keep them from freezing to the glass, and then I did the same to his Corolla to do him a solid. He texted me this morning pretty upset, basically told me not to touch his shit again. Fair enough. 

I mean we’ve always gotten along pretty well. I wouldn’t necessarily say we’re *friends*, but we get along. Brief chit chat if we see each other in the driveway. He invited to his place when they threw a party for his girlfriend getting her green card. He does kickboxing in his basement, and we’ve trained in his basement a couple times. We don’t talk about much, but get along well enough. That’s why I figured he’d appreciate me doing that for him. No one likes their wipers frozen to the glass. 

My first thought was you don’t want someone to miss with your shit in case they fuck something up, but he knows I’m a gear head. I mean hell I even put a new alternator into his Corolla for him because a mechanic wanted over $300 just to put the sob in. 

I dunno. Yeah, in retrospect, texting him asking if he wanted me to put his wipers up would’ve been easy. It really just never crossed my mind

Now complete the following example-
input: Hi all, 
I volunteer at an Aged Care Community once a week. There is a gentleman here who has Dementia and Alzheimer’s. He can be a become a bit aggressive towards people and doesn’t like sitting for too long etc. 

The nurses here are absolutely fantastic at managing this, however for some reason whenever I’m around he calms down and will sit and talk to me. Sometimes I’ll approach him and talk to him, ask him for help with something and he calms right down and will sit with me for ages chatting about all different things. 

Anyway, as one of the nurses pointed out one day, they speculate that it’s because I look and sound like his daughter. I didn’t think too much of it, but he repeatedly tells me he loves me (of course I say this back to him) but I don’t correct him when he calls me by her name, or when he asks about the family I always say they’re good etc. 

I know that it might sound a bit trivial to some, however the place I volunteer at values honesty and integrity, it really is a great place to work. I’m conflicted because I think technically I’m lying by not correcting him, and that goes against everything I’ve ever been taught/do. 

So what do you think guys? 
AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: Going to say right off the bat, my title for this situation isn’t very good, and doesn’t do much justice. I’m just going to type out the scenario, and some of you can put your thoughts below, just ignore the terrible title. 
As for the person I’ll be bringing up here, I’ll just refer to them as Kendall, since I don’t want to risk any small chances of witch hunting to occur.

So Kendall and I have known each other for years. We met up on a social media site, and our only way of contacting each other, is through text messages. For the most part, things tended to be pretty laid back. We’d greet each other, say some nice things, and occasionally roleplayed. Nothing much happens in our conversations to be honest. 

But anyways, things started going downhill when I became a bit inactive. I would occasionally disappear for a bit, sometimes for a week or two, sometimes a month. Whenever this happened, she would get upset with me, and understandably so. I genuinely felt bad for not being able to juggle my life outside and inside the phone properly. Soon after though, there were times where she would randomly disappear, or wouldn’t say anything until I messaged her. So now both of us were guilty of doing this, but whenever it was her that disappeared, I never got upset about it. 

After some time, it started getting to me. I grew irritated whenever she got mad at me over this, as I’ve stated before, we were both guilty about it now. Eventually, I told her that it felt unfair for her to get mad at me like this, especially since I had always forgiven her whenever she was gone for a while. Just to give a little bit context, she got mad when I disappeared for a few days, when some time before, she vanished for a whole month. 

She didn’t take what I said too nicely. Kendall got mad at me for being open about how I felt, and began to spout out how she had been working her butt of in school so that she wouldn’t get beaten. To give some more context, not once had she ever brought any of this up to me. It came out suddenly, and randomly. 

Ever since then, we have been getting along off and on. One moment we’ll be cheerfully greeting each other, and the other, she’ll get angry over the following things: 

1. Me not responding too often. 
2. Me trying to break off our now toxic relationship. 
3. Me not asking about any of her hobbies, or checking up on her personal life. 

Mind you, she does all of this too, and kinda fails to catch this. 

I could go on about the details, but I don’t want this to go on for much longer. If you guys want anymore clarification on the things that have happened between me and this person, you’re more than welcome to ask. 
 
So, AITA? Honestly though, my post is a jumbled mess. I didn’t necessarily focus on the question I brought up, and I probably didn’t get into a lot of detail over some of the things here. Regardless though, I’d like to know anyone’s thoughts, and I’d be more than happy asking questions.

input: So I know this is going to sound like a SHP, and I know many are going to call it that anyway, but this is really my life. From a young age I have always been freakishly tall. I was 6'0 at 14. I am now bordering on 7 feet at 22. My growth has slowed down considerably, which I am thankful for, but throughout my life I have been struggling.

I know a lot of guys want to be taller. In reality, you feel very strange around your friends when you're growing up, and your family photos when you're a child make you look like a monster with a childs face and a mans body. I am also very shy despite what people think and I was verbally bullied at times based on my height and lankiness in highschool. I have to eat a lot of food to put on weight. I eat almost 4,000 calories a day to maintain my average build.

Now I have started working out to increase my self esteem and I eat almost 5,000 a day. I weigh 320 pounds more or less. I can't go on many rides at theme parks and there are many activities I miss out on. Driving is terrible unless im in a larger pick up truck with cab space, which is very expensive. I don't have too many friends.

Women are also intimidated by me. I have a nice face on my profile but when we meet up they are very taken aback and quiet. They don't enjoy being around me. That all changed when I met my girlfriend who is 5'10, but has been amazing to me.

We have been dating for almost a year and have only been able to penetrate her a few times. My penis is too big for her she says. I measured it at fully erect and I am bordering on nine inches when hard, a little less. The thickness is also an issue since I can only get myself ""in"" maybe an inch or two before she starts complaining.

We have settled into her giving me oral sex, which I do enjoy somewhat and but that she REALLY enjoys. She is very enthusiastic to put it mildly, and she also expects me to be as enthusiastic when I give her oral sex which I also dont like that much but I do it to make her happy.

However as a man I have a deep desire to penetrate a woman, its just a natural feeling. And whenever I sort of lead things that way she rejects me. She has allowed me to rub against her and other things but thats it. 

Now everything has gone to a head and she has flat out told me that she does not want me to fuck her, and I am very angry and hurt. I realize that I am not a ""normal"" man and I don't want to hurt her, but I don't know if I can keep living like this and be happy. I don't enjoy blowjobs nearly as much as she does. I don't enjoy handjobs at all, I don't like rubbing against her vagina as its not the same and sort of emasculating.

i also know that she has been penetrated by her smaller boyfriends, but she wont allow me due to my size, which also hurts.

I still think there are other options for us to maybe try penetration, but i am angry that she has shut the door entirely. I am almost thinking about breaking up and trying to find someone else but i do love her.

AITA for being angry that my gf wont try penetrative sex?

Now complete the following example-
input: I started a new job in a new city. On the first day I met this awkward girl, but very sweet.
I had no place to stay and  I was just starting up in this new place so she offered me to stay in her spare room in her apartment.
I started to realise her perfect relationship with her boyfriend wasn't that strong, not as strong as they made out.
He turned out to be massive addict (you name it and he was on it). 
So this girl is my co worker, and after several lunches and drinks she started to tell me that he's never hit her but has emotionally abused her.
One night she and I were getting drunk and she kissed me. I let it happen.
Since then I have seen a spark in her eyes, she's more chatty and outspoken.
Even though I like this girl I could not accept her as an actual girlfriend, she's too anxious, quiet and awkward.
I find her physically attractive and feel like our kiss has given her the courage to leave her abusive boyfriend. But I feel like she may expect us to be a couple if she breaks up with him.
TLDR: am I the asshole because a girl cheated on her boyfriend with me but I don't want to date her.

input: Long time reader, first time poster (so sorry if the format is off)! English isn't my first language either, so grammar/spelling/phrasing might be off. Anyways, this question have been bothering me for a bit, so i thought I would seek some opinions here.  


A bit of backstory: Me and two other childhood friends moved to the same city to attend university, two of us have driver license and our own cars, but the third have neither. All three of are from the same small town which is a few hours away from the city were we currently goes to university. Between the two of us that have cars there is no problem, we have an agreement that we each pay half of the trip, or changes the car we use every other time (for shorter trips)  


The problem is that this third friend, who never/rarely pays anything or offers to pay during or after a trip, usually these trips where the third friend is involved is to/from the city where we studies, and our hometown! On the trip we need to take ferries, and the other expenses is fuel and the normal wear and tear. So a one way trip would be an estimated 130$, and since we are all students that means that none of us have that much money.  
Therefor I feel that we should share the expenses, and that it is unfair that I or the other friend (sometimes both of us) should pay everything so that the third friend can get to our hometown for free.  
When neither the other friend or I are going to our hometown the third friend usually takes bus and train, and complains a bit about it.

So WIBTA if I told the third friend that they will need to start paying or share the expenses if they want a ride?

Now complete the following example-
input: BIL is not a bad person by any means. He cares for my sister, he's a responsible adult, he's a good father to my neice and nephew, and he gets along well with the entire family. Most days I like him. His biggest flaw is his sense of humour. Off-colour paired with sarcasm so strong that we can never tell whether he is serious or not. Not harmful by any means, but very annoying.

He jokes with everyone, but he likes to tease me the most because I can't help but react strongly. His favourite thing is hiding my phone. If I ever let go of my phone, he will silently snatch it up and hide it somewhere. Once I realize it's gone, he makes me guess where it is. Most of the time, it's somewhere innocent like a random cupboard or under someone else's seat. 

There has only been a few times where his jokes genuinely upset me, but even then dealing with my sister and my BIL can be exhausting for me. Part of the reason I put up with it is because of how many times they help me. I work hard, but I don't have a secure source of income and can barely pay my bills. Sister helps by giving me a container of leftovers whenever I visit, or she asks me if I want any old clothes or accessories that she is throwing out. While it's very nice of her to do those things, it makes me feel like a charity case. 

Fast forward to now:

BIL took my new phone and hid it in one of those wet whipe containers that he thought was empty. There were no cloths, but there was an inch of cleaning liquid at the bottom that he didn't notice. My phone soaked up that liquid like a sponge and died almost instantly.

My sister yelled at him promising that they would pay for a replacement. BIL wouldn't even apologize. He was frantically researching ways to fix my phone (store it in rice, getting help at the apple store, etc.) and muttering something like how he can't believe he's going spend one of his rebates on replacing my phone. Did I mention that this all happened on his birthday?

My applecare expired a week before and my phone plan can't give me any better offers so the only thing I can do is buy a new phone at the apple store. I get the oldest and cheapest generation that they have, which ends up costing almost $700. I buy applecare and a new protective case at my own expense. 

While I would have rather this not happen at all, I'm kind of glad that BIL learned his lesson and maybe he'll leave me alone. Does this make me an asshole?

tl;dr BIL's sense of humor gets on my nerves. One day, his prank ends up costing me my phone. I think the guilt and the cost to replace my phone will teach him not to pick on me. Does it make me a bad person if I'm relieved?

Now complete the following example-
input: So I (M23) have been dating this guy (M27) for about 6 months, I'm really committed to him as this is the first serious relationship I have ever been in. Around 3 days ago, I and a few of my classmates decided to go grab lunch at a shopping complex a few minutes away from school. This complex is very close to where my boyfriend goes to school, so naturally I texted him and told him that we would be having lunch near his school and he's welcome to join us. He responded in the affirmative, this was at around 1:15 pm. We get lunch and start eating and at around 1:40, I realise that it's getting late, so I text him telling him that I have to be back in class at around 2:00 pm. He responds, ""OK"". We continue eating and at around 2:00 pm I call him and tell him that are leaving, he responds with a casual ""OK"". So I go on my merry-way back to class. That evening as I'm texting him I notice that he's being very blunt and snippy. This continues up to the next morning. The next day we meet a friend, and he's (the bf) is acting normal, but I can tell something's still wrong, although I have no clue what it is. Anyway at some point in the night I force it out of him and he tells me that he had come all the way to the cafe only to get a call when he arrived that we had left. He says that he is extremely pissed off. I admit that I know this is a touchy area for him as he really doesn't like his ""time being wasted"" but still, AITA here?
But wait, there's more. As the night goes on he keeps taking silent but hurtful jabs at me in conversation. However I tolerate this, as I know that when he's mad his mouth grows a mind of its own and he ""can't remember"" all that he said after he's cooled down. I was willing to let this all slide until he asked me to drive him to get his new bike from the mechanic. I was a bit apprehensive to do so as I was driving my dad's car and wanted to conserve fuel, but I agreed to it because I love him. As we leave I ask for the directions. Getting to the mechanics’ is fairly simple however I am not great at directions. That said, and him being aware of this, everytime I ask him for directions I get a bunch of snide comments questioning my intelligence and it gets pretty hurtful. This day was no different unfortunately and I was seething by the time we finally arrived. He then asks me to drive behind him all the way back to his house as he's not confident on the road, I tell him that this was not part of the plan but he insists. I angrily go along with it knowing that I've more than doubled my journey home because he looks extremely unstable on the bike. When I get home he calls to tell me that I have a lot of his stuff in my car, like his phone charger and laptop which he needs for school. He asks how he's going to get them back and I tell him that he'll get them when he gets them (I'll send them tomorrow). He then asks me why I'm pissed off and I tell him it's nothing and hang up the phone. So yet again I ask you, AITA?

input: WIBTA

So, a lil background,
I(21M) lend my best friend (21M) 2k€ for his business last year.

I lend him the money because he had asked me &amp; after questioning him about why/how he was gonna use it it seemed just fine &amp; clear.

He told me he's obv gonna pay me back in full, &amp; i know he is going to. The thing is, he has stopped his business, is not working atm (&amp;will probably not work again cus he says i don't want a 9 to 5 / don't wanna be working for someone else).

I get his pov, but the situation he's in is just not showing any prosperity.. living at home with his parents (not necessarily a bad thing)  &amp; literally no money in the bank..


So, i just moved abroad, he came over for a week before he went to the UK to do some workaway thing..
I paid a lot of the expenses made here while he was visiting me but also 50/50'd a lot, (i covered a bit more of the expenses as he was my ""guest"") 


During the week he was here, he lost another ""x"" amount from his business that dropped his bank account to (lets say) -50€
So.. no money in the bank except a lil cash..

He was asking me for advice, so i played business man and started to ask serious questions like, where do you have money. He replied that in this account (no bank account) he had like 230,-

I stated that all the money he had not in his direct possession, to try to get it in his direct possession.
The 230 landed, but as we were abroad of where we usually live he'd have to pay a fee to get cash (not normal for our country).      I told him; look, i have cash, i'll give u whatever you need to not pay for unnecessary fees, he told me aight cool, i'll pay you back the moment i have connection(internet, somehow he didn't have it when he was visiting)  he told me he'd wire it the moment he'd land in the UK, thas half a week ago..
He still owes me in total 1k,.  #wibta if i ask him to wire the money i lend him last week straight away ?  Not talking bout the amount he owed me what i lend him for his business as i said before i dont ""need"" it straight away.


I know he's gonna pay me back.. but it looks a bit.. meh now, don't have any more words to describe the situation atm..

Long story short; I lend my friend money for business that i had no exact date to pay me back.
Lend him more money for him avoiding paying fees, 
#wibta for asking the money that i lend him recently back?

I'm in quite of a pickle here..

(Sorry for bad spelling here n there, its late &amp; i'm kinda drunk)

input: Apologize for the formatting if it doesn’t look right, I’m on mobile. 

Anyway, my best friend and I are in the same grade, and we’re at that point in our lives where we need to seriously consider college and future plans. My best friend is VERY smart. She’s in the same classes I’m in, and they’re mostly all honors/AP classes (putting that in for context so you know I understand her class material). 

But she’s lazy. She doesn’t try. She used to be a straight A student and now she has two Ds and a C. Me and her parents know she can do better, she just doesn’t try. I know she doesn’t because she always jokes about how she doesn’t study. Instead of taking ten minutes to look over notes, she plays video games (Nothing wrong with playing video games, I play them too). 

Yesterday I caught her doing her homework that was due next period with five minutes left of lunch. I said 

“______ why didn’t you do that at home or during study period?” 

She says 

“Really, OP? How is your love life going?” 

And it really hurt me because she knows I hate when she says stuff like that, because my love situation is not the greatest right now (issues with a person that is super important to me) 

And it made me think that maybe me being on her for her grades is making her mad. I just know she can do better and I want her to do her best so she doesn’t settle for anything less than what she deserves. 

I admit I do talk to her about it around friends, but my other friends are on her about it too. 

So, AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: I have 3 children with my ex husband. My kids and their cousins are all middle/high school age. I will keep this concise:

My ex usually has the kids every other weekend. He tells me he needs to switch weekends for work. Ok, fine, no problem. Then he tells me he promised a sleepover with his sister's children (my children's cousins) that weekend, so they will also be coming over. I tell him absolutely not. He's mad at me about this and so are my kids now.

I've only seen my kids' cousins once or twice in almost 10 years, since the divorce. I'm sure they're great kids and my kids love them, but I can tell their cousins feel awkward around me. I completely understand that, because we were never close enough justify keeping contact after the divorce, especially since they were young when it happened. I just don't want to spend my weekend with my kids feeling that kind of awkward tension. 

For the record, I called my ex's sister and explained the situation so she could reschedule and explain to her kids and she seemed pretty horrified at what her brother did.

My kids and ex are very pissed at me though. AITA?
output: ",not wanting to supervise my kids' sleepover with their cousins

input:      Me(23) and my girlfriend (22) were going to watch our second Netflix movie of the day and I know she usually doesn't like to watch movies with my family, mainly romantic ones(for obvious reasons). So then I ask her if she would be okay with me inviting my family to watch the movie. We discussed it a little bit and she doesn't want me to invite anyone but don't know why she doesn't want to, she just says she gets uncomfortable, she isn't that much against it also. 
      Skips a little and just when we're about to start the movie my brother (25) walks in the room and he can clearly see the we were about to see a movie so I invite him to see it with us and he accepted, even though we haven't finished the discussion yet. Me and my girlfriend are cool about it, but we really want to know if there are assholes here.

Edit: We were at my house with my whole family in here.

Now complete the following example-
input: Backstory. My mom has always been great, but has never picked the best men. After a 20+ year marriage, she caught my stepdad cheating and they divorced. Infidelity aside, he was a world class prick. Misogynistic, racist, narcissistic, manipulative, etc. The divorce was nasty, but my mother made it out and had a new outlook on life. At this point, my wife (newly married) and my mother had a great relationship, like a sit and talk and laugh for hours type of relationship. 

Enter my mom’s new BF. At first he seems super nice and well behaved. Slowly, he starts to make little comments toward the women in my family. Never myself or my in-laws. Nothing awful, but things that suggested that he was in charge. If he ever crossed lines, he would pull that move where he pretended that it was a joke and that they couldn’t take it. He, for some reason, really singled out my wife. He spoke down to her and tried to flat out tell her what to do. At first, I didn’t even see it, or maybe ignored it as I grew up around this behavior. 

My wife and I move away (2yrs) then back to for a job. 

To speed up the story, the behaviors that I was concerned about are more prevalent when we return. Racist jokes to my in-laws, booze hidden around the house, etc. I speak to my sisters and they are divided, one likes him, the other does not. 

My mom’s house (which he lives in rent free because of complications with his divorce) has an on suite and we move in while we are waiting to close on our house. I start working right away when I’m gone, he takes issue with everything my wife says or does. She does it all wrong. My mom, is now short with my wife, parroting his issues and judgmental about her lack of job search (we agreed she wouldn’t look until we were settled). 

Naturally, we start avoiding them and figure, 3 more weeks and we are out of here. Then he demands that I bring my wife into the kitchen for a family talk and I fucking lose it. I call him out on all of it, anything that has been under the surface gets said. I Tell him I see right through his BS and the house feels an awful lot like it used to when my stepdad lived there. He gets aggressive with me and I jump out of my chair and he backs down. My mom is crying, calling me disrespectful. I am shouting that respect is earned. Blah, blah, blah. We calm down and he apologizes for ME not reading the situation correctly and puts his hand out. I storm out and ask my wife to start packing. 

Later my sister calls and says that they are worried about my “anger problem” and since then I have had minimal contact with my mom. 

I don’t feel bad about yelling at him. He, in my opinion, needed to be knocked down a peg or two and I needed to defend my wife. I do wonder if AITA for letting this come between my mom and I. We have a great relationship otherwise, but right now I have no interest in seeing her. I just can’t get over that fact that no responsibility was taken on his end and she acts blind to it.

I said well i said i wanted pizza and you saw me getting it, so i told you so whats the deal? Why are ypu throwing a childrens tantrum over PIZZA? Also he insisted i shouldve got and paid a pizza for him aswell.

Now complete the following example-
input: TL:DR- SO works 3rd shift and takes care of LO during day. Lack of sleep has taken a toll on their mental health.

Backstory: SO and I have under 1 yr old child. Daycare is expensive. I work 1st shift (630-230p). They work 3rd shift (10-6a). Our bulidings are close enough for baby trade off in mornings. SO watches baby during day, naptime between 9-12p. I take over baby duty when I get home at 3, SO sleeps till 7

SO has been struggling with getting enough sleep since I came back from leave. I am very concerned for their wellbeing and safety driving hi-low at work. I made some suggestions to help:

There was an job opportunity at my ideal workplace, position would be Fri-Tues 8a-5p. SO vetoed this because then I lose vacation time and forced to get my own insurance.

My retired parents could watch him a few times a week. They live 45mins away but we could meet halfway for trade off. Aside from gas money, care would be free. SO does not like in-laws since they felt I could have done better and told them such while we were dating. My parents respect my decision marrying and are civil towards SO.

The lack of sleep and general stress has gotten to SO. Angers quick and much more snarky towards me. Easily can get frustrated with LO. When well rested, I get to see that loving supportive person again.

I have no longer the option to change jobs; I need the time off for relatives passing away after the holidays. I can't change my shift; its dumb luck I got to 1st and we plan for me to go back to school in evenings. My future degree will allow SO stay home. 

Our mutual friends have noticed the changes in SO as well; its not just my mind jumping into stuff. 

If I mention about being sore or tired it becomes a game of one-up to SO. I have been accused of cheating, not helping, and delayed PPD. I stand there and take it, knowing its the lack of sleep. But I am getting to my breaking point. So....

WIBTA on giving the ultimatum to SO: Leave third shift or I am leaving.

input: Me and my roomates all have a shared cleaning roster, and one of those areas in the kitchen, where its expected to clean the oven/ stove. We all are expected to do our own dishes, but if we have friends around who have a glass of water or a small bit of food and the dish is left out, it is expected that whoever is on kitchen duty cleans up those dishes also. Usually it is not an extreme amount of dishes, and since they aren't anyones dishes who lives here its just lumped into the kitchen cleaning.

One of our roomates is against this, and he doesn't think that he should do them, because they aren't his mess to clean up. We all agree it is not his mess, but if he doesn't clean them they won't get cleaned. We all clean them when it is our turn, but he does not feel the need to.

The argument is reaching critical mass so we thought reddit is the best place to settle this. So are we (the roomates in general) the assholes here?

input: I have to make a disclaimer that no mater how long this is, i cant completely and accurately portray this situation

My girlfriend and i have been dating for almost four years and this is our first year living together in a student apartment. We argue very often and have a very rough patches, but i do love her and our lives revolve around each other. I try to help her when shes upset but she often pushes me away, not letting me touch her and saying nothing is wrong when something clearly is. When i eventually pry it out of her its often not the whole truth or just ""what i want to hear"". This annoys me to an extent I can't describe

I am stupid and sometimes I i sound meaner than i want to when im trying to find out what's wrong, or just tell her straight up how i feel/what i think needs to be done. Shes lately been saying that it makes her feel like I don't care. Allthough in my mind, me trying to get the bottom of the problem so i can help is showing i care

I can only help her to a certain extent and in my opinion if she doesn't want to help me understand what's wrong then i cant help her properly. For 4 years i have been asking her to see a councilor (for this and other reasons) but she refuses saying it wont help and that it doesn't matter. It does matter to me, i think she needs to let everything out and come to terms with our relationship/her personal problems.

Now complete the following example-
input: I’ll try to make this as short as possible without giving you my life story.

My mother was emotionally (and slightly physically) abusive towards me (25f) growing up. She’d call me names (loser, bitch, c*nt) and yell “f*ck you” to me for making small mistakes, even after I made an effort to fix them. She also ignored me (sometimes for days) after we got into fights and never went out of her way to apologize. Here are some specific examples of things she’d do to me:
- The night before I moved into college (20 minutes away from home) I came home late and she got pissed. This led to her not helping me move in my dorm like we had planned. I had to call a friend and help instead.
- She got pissed over something (I forget what) and she threw my French horn against the wall of the living room, so hard that she dented it. She then made me practice it afterwards. 

This has led to low self esteem and a high sense of perfectionism in my adulthood. 

I live 10 hours away from her now. She was diagnosed with cancer last year, and has gotten surgery and chemo treatments since then. I think she’s still getting chemo. 
I get all this information from my dad because I haven’t talked to her in 6 months. I’ve been going to therapy to try and figure out the best way to approach our relationship. 

I feel bad that she’s been sick and that I haven’t talked to her at all, not even a phone call, to see how she’s doing. But talking to her is awful for my mental health. She just sent me an email this morning asking if we can start talking again. She apologized for “whatever she did to make me stop talking to her” but the thing is, I did already tell her (multiple times) why I was angry at her. She should know by now. 

AITA for still not wanting to talk to my mom, though she has cancer and seemingly wants to make amends?

Now complete the following example-
input: So before me and my husband got married we were on separate phone plans. I had my own and he was on his mom's with his dad and sister. He never paid his bill, his mom did. His argument before we were married was it saves him money and we're not married yet. I thought that was funny that a 30 something yr old still had his mom pay for his cell phone, but whatever. I told him once we get married he needs to go on my plan. He agreed. 

Fast forward to about a year later, the day after our wedding. Me, my husband and his mom are sitting and chit chatting. We get on the subject of cell phones and his mom brings up the fact she still is paying for his phone plan. Then tells him that now that me and him are married he should go on my plan. I had the biggest smile on my face. I told him, see even your mom says so. Of course he tries to worm his way out of it. He tells his mom it's ok I can stay on your plan.  

So now, today I bring it up again. He's still trying to worm his way out of it. He asks why is it so important that I join your plan? I tell him it's because I feel that now that were married, your an adult you shouldnt still have your mom paying for your bills. Again his argument is still why would I switch, I'll have to pay more. Don't you want to save money? 

So AITA or does my husband need to grow up and pay his own phone bill?

Now complete the following example-
input: Just for a background, my (now ex, but this episode happened a year before we broke up) gf (F27) is very insecure, jealous and because of that, controlling. I (M23) always showed her that she was the only girl in my life and never did anything close to cheating.

The day I started in my job was the same day she had a test, and if she passed (she did!) she would enter in a doctorate program. This would make our relationship easier because we would be living relatively close (2h drive instead of a 6h bus ride).

When I arrived at the office, I was the only guy, there was 4 women working there, including the HR girl who processed my admission and that my gf made it clear that she was not comfortable about me talking to her.

Anyway, I didn't want to upset my gf or get her on her nerves right before the test, so when she asked who was in the office, I said there was 2 girls, 2 guys and me.

I know it was wrong, but I did with a reason and with the full intent to tell her later that day, but what I intended was worthless. After her test, we were chatting, I slipped and she found out. Later that day we talk about it, almost broke up, but managed to stick together and work through it.

Now I wanna hear some opinions because I'm on the fence, I feel like an asshole, but at the same time I feel justified.

Now, I have a good friend that is a very devoted Christian. She is not the kind of Christian that hates anyone, she believes in love. Nonetheless, I don't know what's her opinion on the LGBT community. I'm afraid that even if she accepts me, she may be more reserved towards me.

She noticed that I've been behaving differently and she made me tell her that I have a crush. I thought it was safe to just tell her that I like someone, but she's pushing for more information.

Should I tell her that it's a girl? I can't ask her now about her opinion on LGBT cause she'll know that it's connected. I'm afraid what's her reaction gonna be like. Should I tell her that I'm bi? Would I be an asshole if I lied to her that it's a boy?

So I go to Sam's room and in front of the drawer is a tv tray table with a large piece of cardboard on top.

On this cardboard was a nearly finished jigsaw puzzle.

So I carefully moved the table and open the drawer.

A few seconds later, the cardboard tilts and then slides off the tv tray table and the puzzle shatters to pieces on the ground.

Remaining on the tv tray table was two very small boxes that the cardboard was balancing on out of my view.

input: Bf and I have been dating for 5 months. We live in different cities which has made spending time together a challenge. The last 4 weekends, we have made plans to hang out and it has fallen thru due to him having a lot of issues going on with his roommates and his mom being sick. Legit issues, that I have not held against him but have been super patient and supportive, even going so far as to drive 40 miles to get his favorite comfort food and deliver it to his house in the middle of the night.. 
Now, this weekend I am planning on celebrating my bday by getting out of town. I have had my own issues going on and i need a get away. 
We have both been working back to back 12 hour shifts to clear this weekend. I asked him last week if he was good to go, and he responded with yes! And i booked a (non refundable)room for us in the mountains.
Yesterday he tells me that his good friend will be in town this weekend, and he wants me to meet him, and could we possibly include them in our plans. 
Considering my plan was to be laid up in the hotel all weekend, no not really.. So i told him that he should plan to see his friend and i will just do me.
So, AITA for wanting him to myself for 2 days? It seems as tho our tine is always stolen, and he has acknowledged that.

input: (When I say local I mean not an overseas traveler)

Long story short I work at a hostel and had to call the police on a drunk local (A) (who was a guest) and they took him away to the drunk tank. He has a friend (B) here too who was better behaved than his friend, but still a straight up nuisance. I told B he was allowed to stay for the night but chances of him being able to stay for any longer were slim as while not a major asshole himself, still has attachment A, who frankly I never want to see again in my life. He ended up giving me a sad sap story about how they had no where else to go and that he had no money. B was a genuinely nice person but super drunk and as I work by myself (night shift) I am not taking the chance.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is is I can probably spin the story to my boss to allow B to still stay here somehow and do feel sorry imagining him basically homeless in a foreign city with no money, but at the same time I feel it's a make your bed and sleep in it type situation. What do you guys think?

He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he’d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I’d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I’d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can’t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I’m tired????

I guess the part that bothers me is that I’ve spent countless hours the last two summers helping him reno his house and then helping him reno his back patio.  Obviously I wouldn’t expected to be paid for helping him reno but kinda assumed it’s a I’ll scratch your back you scratch mine kind of thing. After renoing his house I bought a house and wanted to redo the plumbing, he showed up for a grand total of three days and then stopped showing up and sent an employee that I had to pay. I wasn’t really impressed because I had spent so much time helping him. (on and off for three months atleast a couple days a week)

I’m all for supporting a friends business but I’m starting to feel a little shafted. I was assuming that he would just send a bill for his employees hrs at his hourly rate, not his marked up contractor pricing. So am I the asshole for expecting a deal and should I say something or should I just shut up and pay it and never help him again when he asks?

input: Gf and I got into Game of Thrones last year.  We watch it together.   It’s quickly become my all time favorite show.   She likes it, but I don’t think cares nearly enough as me about it.  I say that because she will also be on her phone during the show.  With this show you have to pay really close attention or you will miss a lot and that’s where the problem comes into play.  

She keeps talking throughout it during.  It’s driving me insane.   “Who’s that?”  “What are they doing?”  “Why did he do that?”   All of her questions would be answered if she paid attention to the show, but she’s only half in half out.   That’s fine, but don’t ruin it for me.   I’ve tried pausing while I answer her questions, but the show is so complicated that usually she just acts bored when I start up.  


I like that we have this show that we both enjoy and can watch together.   Usually it’s not the case and we have to fight for the remote haha.  She gets mad when I watch without her, but I have to go back rewatch episodes sometimes because her constant talking throughout makes me miss a lot of details.  

It’s never good to lie, but I feel like in this case it might be better than telling her she needs to be quiet while we watch.   I’d rather just binge the rest of the series while she’s gone and pretend that it’s a first time viewing when I watch with her.

input: Context: I'm 21M, sister's 18F, we both live at my parents', and they own/pay the internet; I'm the only one who has the password to access the router's GUI.

I'm also epileptic, and while I'm not sensitive to light, I'm sensitive to fatigue.

I go to sleep at 10 and browse reddit until 10:30 (gotta be honest here); I then wake up at 6 to get to work for 8.

Meanwhile, my sister goes in her bed at around the same time, but sometimes (three times per week, most of the time), she's on phone for HOURS during the night, until midnight sometimes. I don't know who exactly she's talking to, and I don't really care; she's not in a long-distance relationship, she has a bf who lives about 30 minutes away.

Now, I really like sleeping, and for health reasons, I need as much as possible.

I tried asking her one time, her solution was to go downstairs; this doesn't fix anything, I can still hear her very clearly. My parents tried to tell her to stop, but she doesn't. 

At the moment, whenever I go to bed and hear her on the phone, I tell her to stop her call asap.

This has been persisting for a month and I'm getting tired of it.

I'd put a parental control rule that only enables the access from 5am to 10pm; I'd obviously not tell her in order to try to disencourage her to use the wifi after 10pm. I checked in advance and already know how to do it, and found her device in the router's list.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: sister stops me from sleeping because of phone calls, I need to sleep, tried confronting to no avail, WIBTA if I put parental control rules on her phone?

Now complete the following example-
input: I recently moved into a new apartment. The housemate I was subletting from was apparently involved in an ongoing court case with our landlord due to not having paid rent in *several months*. He didn't tell me or our other housemates this, and a week after I got here an eviction notice was posted on our apartment. To make a long story short, we called the cops to report that he'd stolen our money, and the landlord, who didn't know we existed, eventually agreed to let us rent from him while evicting only the asshole.

The place is in terrible condition because the asshole seemed almost dead set on destroying it- the carpets are horribly stained, he bolted wood platforms into the floor of the living room because he was planning to rent it out as another bedroom, there are huge cracks in most of the doors that I could not possibly explain, nothing works and everything is filthy- but the part that I now have is gigantic. I have an entire spare bedroom, and the rent is way cheaper than most places around here. 

I'm working on cleaning it up and making it livable, and have been thinking of subletting that extra bedroom. My mother, whom I normally don't speak to, thinks I should charge whoever rents from me the entire $750 of rent that I currently pay. She's repeatedly told me I'm a moron and an asshole for wanting to just split the rent down the middle.

I don't think I'm being an asshole. I think an even split is the only fair way to do this, and I'm not sure where I would get off demanding that someone else cover the entirety of my rent, since I don't own the place and the only service I'm providing them is letting them know there's a room available. What do you guys think?

Now complete the following example-
input: I have 2 children, a high school senior and a high school sophomore. The Missus is a cardiac surgeon while I work as a software engineer at a pretty big firm. Needless to say, finances aren’t an issue for us.

Now I’m of the opinion that my kids’ primary focus should be their education right now. They don’t have/need jobs (besides sometimes part-time during the summer), but the wife and I pretty much pay for everything. As such, the kids just expected that we would pay for their college, which honestly, was a reasonable expectation. The problem lies with our daughter: she wants to major in Comparative Literature or something related to writing. Her reasoning is that she loves writing and she’s good at it.

I’m a bit hesitant to just pay for unconditional college. If her goal was to be a writing professor, or just had a specific career goal in mind in general, I’d be a lot more willing. But as it stands, her primary motivator was just because it interests her. I told her that I’m fine paying for education, on the condition that she majored in something more “practical”. Or that if she had a legitimate plan to get from what she’s majoring to what she wants to do, then I’d be happy to pick up the tuition and living expenses, which means she just needs to pay for her own food. If she doesn’t that’s fine, but she’d have to find a way to supplement her education through loans and scholarships (and I will help her do this).  

She accused me of trying to manipulate her. Truth be told, I did try to push STEM to her when she was 15-16, but she consistently brought home Bs-high Cs in stem while getting perfect As to A+s in writing. I conceded that she was just naturally a better writer, and I’ll let her develop her own issues. She’s using this information from the past to claim I’m trying to manipulate her into doing a field that I want her to do.

My POV is, I don’t necessarily care if she does a field in STEM. She can get her Underwater Basket Weaving degree IF she planned to, for example, be a lawyer (and thus has an actual use for the degree), but she can’t just major in something because she “likes” it. Unless the like will lead to a potential career path in mind.

My wife won’t take a side (she’s normally the one that has these little spats with our daughter while me and her normally see eye-to-eye). So I come to you, Reddit, to help me see if I’m being unreasonable.

AITA for wanting to add stipulations to what I’d pay for in college?

Now complete the following example-
input: Hello. First of all, I work in a dental surgery as a dental nurse so sterilization and all is very important and integral. Me and my bosses (head dentist and his wife) are friendly to each other so we never really had a bad time and I enjoy going to work everyday.

So today, I was the only dental assistant working and I'm was supposed to supervise this lovely old lady who we are currently training for reception and help in the sterilization. But due to our schedule today, I couldn't supervise enough so I just told the old lady to just dry the things and drop in the dry towel and I'll help her sort it out later. 

Now what happened later is, while me and my boss are hanging out in the room while gathering instruments for the next patient, we found heaps of non-sterilized instruments which we used today packed  but  haven't gotten through the autoclave mixed with the sterilized ones. I was a bit surprised and I accidentally said ""What the heck, these are non-sterilized!"". And my boss got noticed of it and it was the first time I've seen him really angry and anxious because of the unclean instruments mixed on there. We hurriedly scour the drawers and found several more. 

This was then I knew that this were the instrument I packed earlier that I placed in the ""To autoclave"" section. Some of them have tracking stickers which I helped the old lady print it out but I didn't have time to check because I was mid surgery and I only got out to get some instruments needed. The packets have indicators if they are sterilized or not as well and I'm pretty sure my fellow dental nurse who was in charge of training her had taught her that. 

Now my boss was so mad he started cursing to himself in a soft voice and fairly anxious as well as this is what he says breach of safety. His wife came to us and he told her about this. I didn't hear their conversation since I went back to the room to set up for the next surgery. 5 min later, my boss came in the surgery and told me ""she's done working here, thanks for that. I'm really grateful you found those"". Now after this he told me that his wife said she's not doing a good job in the reception too and they also found some packs where the instruments are mixed and matched. They gave her time but this was the tipping point. 

I feel bad now because I could've checked those packs but I didn't and all I did was print the tracking stickers and ran off. Also I feel like if I didn't say that those aren't sterilized and just took them all out, she could've been there still. I really like the old lady since she was really nice and I know she's trying her best. She's also given me some jelly yesterday. I really feel guilty and depressed atm.

Within 15 minutes two of the tables were sat and both had children less than a year old with them. Neither table were couples out for a nice evening together, they were both mom's with friends. Who were all very loud in conversation I should mention. 
Before we could get our main course both babies were crying and fussing very loud, and the mother's were both very inattentive. 
We get our food, order another glass of wine, and we finish quickly because we were both uncomfortable with the ear piercing screams surrounding us.

input: My husband is a veteran, who enjoys everything that has to do with guns. During the week he goes to the range with his friends around 1-3 times. On the weekends he’ll usually be hunting or participating in his rifle association. He also suffers from PTSD, insomnia, and depression so I try to let him do the things he enjoys to help him with his hardships.

Fast forward to the present, I have never hosted a event for my family as I have always been super busy with work. My nephew, who I love very dearly was about to turn 2, so I decided to offer to host the party for my sister since I know her house is extremely messy since she has to take care of a infant.

Once I started cleaning I realized how unsuitable our home might appear to guests, we have many flags, medals, and guns mounted everywhere around the house. I decided that the biggest thing that needed to be addressed were the weapons, so I asked if we could temporarily take them down.

He agreed to take them all down except for one, which is located right above our fireplace. His reason being that his very close friend died literally by his side in battle, and something he had always promised was to keep and honor all of his memorabilia, as he doesn’t have a wife or children. 

He believes removing his weapon from the mantle would be a dishonor to his friend, and thinks that he is already being accommodating enough by removing the rest of the weapons. 

I’m not that satisfied on one hand I do empathize for my husband, on the other I don’t want parents to be uncomfortable with a weapon in their view, especially with kids around.

Any advice is appreciated, if you have any questions feel free to ask. I’m getting ready for work currently so I might not be able to reply quickly but I will definitely get around to it.

Now complete the following example-
input: On mobile so apologies for formatting.

Background information: Years ago when I was working my first job as a teenager, I worked at a popular breakfast/lunch in my family’s well-to-do neighbourhood. We had a 25-30ish regular who would order a meal (not cheap) and ask for our recycling. I was told that he was brain-damaged ex-military and that his parents (who lived a short bus ride) housed him, clothed him and covered his food bills but he collected recycling for pocket money. 

Anyways, he would come in every other day, hit on all the female staff, explain to male staff that he wasn’t gay (almost every time) and then relentlessly go after our baker. He would ask her out, ask to kiss her, ask to have sex with her, ask to have dinner at her house, ask her and her husband to take him out for dinner. She was actually quite friendly to him but obviously didn’t take him seriously, and kindly excused her way out. I found out later that he had actually successfully invited himself to her wedding, had been over to her house for dinner multiple times (with husband present), and had attempted to three wheel her honeymoon.

She eventually told me (in parts overtime) that because of his condition, we had to be more sympathetic and kinder to him than the average customer:person, and that essentially it was the brain damage that made him act that way. Fortunately I never had to deal with him much while working since he always wanted her, the head baker, to take his order personally (not her job) and she did it because we have to “think of his condition”. When I told my parents about this, they agreed with the baker and I didn’t (and still don’t really) know the effects of brain damage so I left it like that.

Next to the assholery: Even though I didn’t really deal with him much at work, we used the same bus stop (and occasionally same bus). He used to recognize me from work and beeline it for me, be overly friendly (he assumed we were really good friends since I smiled and asked him how he was when I was working), asked to sit next to me on the bus and sat down before I could respond (I let him because he was and customer at my work and I was a stupid teenager with severe social anxiety), or sit super close to me at the bus stop when the whole bench was empty. Mind you I was a minor at this time.

As the years passed (and I was no longer working at my first job), I would still run into him at the bus stop and he would hit one and ask me out. I would turn him down absolutely but kindly, keeping in mind his “condition”. It never even gave him pause, he kept on trying. I want to remind readers that I have really bad social anxiety that makes me dread any interaction with strangers etc and even most acquaintances. This was truly awful for me.

Eventually I go travelling, work in various places, take some classes across the country and then come home, live with my parents and start finishing up my degree at a local university. And sure enough, he’s still here, still taking the same bus and still trying to talk to me. I don’t think he recognized me but I still feel singled out: I’m an awkward polte-looking young girl who might seem like an easy target.

The first time he comes up to me and starts talking to me, I take off my headphones (which I always wear since I hate talking to people), tell him “I’m sorry, I don’t like talking to people,” and put my headphones back on. He just stares at me silently, still standing uncomfortable close to me, until I walk away. This repeats a couple times until I start pretending I don’t hear him and wander aimlessly away. I have tried hiding from him, it doesn’t work; the guy has a spidey sense for young girls (I have seen him act like this towards other girls). Tonight when he bothered me I just looked at him and walked to the other side of the bus stop, he tried to follow me so I walked behind it and waited there, keeping an eye on him until his bus came. The next time I see him I might just tell him to fuck off, despite my damn social anxiety.

Am I asshole? Most of my friends and family think so. They’ve told me to be more patient and considerate of his “condition”. But they don’t have to deal with his relentlessness. He’s never been physical and comes off as cheery/friendly but he seems to have no sense of object permanence or concept that no means no, not ever and not just no for this specific thing for the next five minutes. I guess it’s possible that his injury affects his memory (even though he remembered me for years after I quit my first job. But I still don’t feel like I should have to deal with this on basically a weekly basis.

I feel like no one has ever told him no seriously and then held him accountable when he tries again. People treat him with larger kid gloves than they treat their own children.

So yeah, am I the asshole? Also, advice for how I should deal with him in the future is welcomed.

Now complete the following example-
input: To preface, I had a best friend, call her Sarah. A girl best friend who I'm sure you all can follow the train of events to realize she had friend-zoned me. We were good friends for about 4-5 years. That's enough of that, I never spoke about my feeling to her nor her to me. It was something of an agreement. I lied to myself that I had lost feeling for her. Moving on, I met this wonderful girl from the other high school in my county, call her Erin. We hit it off and had the best of chemistry. We got together.  However, there are always these little indications that I still had feelings for my Sarah, I brushed them off. Erin picked up on them she went along though. We had some spats about it with me always saying ""I have no feelings for her"" you know the usual.  Well, it comes time for me and Sarah to go to college. Erin (where she was so small as a child was held back) had one more year left. Well, its the last weeks of August. Football season starts. Erin goes to our Highschools' rivalry game. There she sees multiple people who all said the same thing that I love Sarah. She finally broke and said I need to cool off on messaging Sarah. Well, I did for a week, I even informed Sarah about it. Then Sarah begins to get upset. It goes into an entire day of me trying to compromise between the two and being accused of supporting the other. It ended with Erin and I together and me removing Sarah from my life. I didn't want to lose either. However, I had to pick. Love or friendship. Erin made me write a scathing message to Sarah, which I regretted. I'd later delete all correspondence between Sarah and I. That would prove an issue when I had no proof.  

&amp;#x200B;

Later I would be accused of talking to Sarah again. Apparently, she had messaged my girlfriend's friend, Jennifer, and said we still stay in touch. May God strike me dead as I'm typing this I never came into contact with Sarah since that day in August. That was a fight, I should've handled better. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward, now some 6 months later. Erin and I have had some ups and down. However, all-in-all we're great. We quite honestly make a 4 1/2 hour drive up and down our state work! We talk all the time. She's still the girl of my dreams. I've completely lost all care for Sarah. She messaged me once, while on a date with Erin. I let Erin blast into her, as me. She was on a different number is how she was able to message me.  

&amp;#x200B;

Then today ""She"" messages me. I am stricken by her apologetic words.. It was only inevitable she'd message me. There were messages of ""You owe me at least this"" and ""Would you really do this for all those years of friendship,"" ""I'm just here to apologize."" I told my girlfriend she had messaged me. She said she trusted me to handle it. Then Erin had a change of heart and said not to. I said to let this be the test of how far I've came. She said no the test is for me not to message Sarah. Well, I had already had my thoughts piqued and thought whats the issue in at least giving quarter to someone and hearing them out. I'll listen to Sarah then Erin can say I can't talk to her anymore, everything will be fine...I'll have closure.   Well she goes to apologize. Sarah says she wants her best friend back. I explain my logic why it weighed on Erin and that I loved someone else. It truly did hurt her. Sarah seems to understand. I ask about why she messaged Erin's friend and she said she really thought I would leave Erin for her. I tell her to prove that she's serious delete the messages up. She shows me a screenshot of said messages deleted. She then reiterates she wants her best friend back I say I need time I do forgive her though. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, it all falls apart. Turns out it was Jennifer messaging with Erin sitting in the car watching me message ""Sarah."" I am then accused of lying, again, and now I'm blocked from everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I the asshole? 

&amp;#x200B;

\* I know I wasn't supposed to lie to my girlfriend. The guilt I had of not hearing Sarah out was biting at me though; just out of respect to our old friendship. 

\*\*If this goes big and some youtube is going to do a reading of r/AmItheAsshole please refrain from reading mine.

input: Throwaway account and posting from mobile, yada yada....

For some background, about 3 weeks ago my wife was supposed to go on a work trip for about a month.  After she was set to go, i made some plans to have a small weekend roadtrip to see some friends in my hometown. Her trip was canceled the day before she was supposed to leave, and we were both very happy about that. 

Fast forward to now. This is the weekend i was supposed to go visit, and my wife has found out that she's leaving for a few weeks for a different unexpected work trip this monday. She really wanted to go out (which we have not been able to do for a while) and spend the weekend together before she leaves, but several of my old friends are already excited that I'm making a trip in, and one had planned a party, which he has already spent a decent amount of money on. 

I'd love to spend the weekend with my wife, but my closest friend has already gotten the weekend off, which as a cook/bartender  is hard for him to do, and spent well over $100 on a small party for me. 

I can tell my wife is dissapointed, though she understands, and i want to be here for her before she leaves, but i don't want to leave the people expecting me hanging out to dry either. I offered to take her out on a nice date tomorrow, as I'm leaving on Friday, to make up for it, but i still feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place. 

AITA for not cancelling my trip?

input: I am not able to keep my cool about this and longer. I don't like shouting because I think it makes me look like a lunatic, but at the same time I've lost all patience.

Last election day I was in a multi-car accident that was my fault. No one was hurt, and most of the damage to all the cars was minimal. But the insurance company decided that the cost of repairs to my car was valued higher than my car, so they totaled it. 

After 10 exhausting days of test driving &amp; trying to decide on a different car, I decided that I loved my previous car so much that I bought another similar used car; same make &amp; model, older year. It was mint condition and I was excited. The car dealer was an hour from my house, which didn't seem like an issue at the time of purchase.

When I drove the car home, I noticed an oil leak on the floor of my garage. Called the dealer who said he would take care of it and 2 days later he gave me a loaner car until it was repaired. 

Driving home from the dealer, I stopped to get gas and noticed my bumper had a hole in it and a bumper light was cracked. At this point I'm feeling jinxed, but I reach out to the dealer again who promises to fix it since it happened in his lot.

This was Thanksgiving week and the following week I was scheduled to have a mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction. Having a ton of anxiety about the upcoming 10 hour surgery, my husband assured me that he would take my car to the dealer for repair while I was home recovering. At that time he was going to be off work to help me, and I was glad that I didn't have to think about it anymore.

My surgery happened, he was off work, and my parents even stayed an extra week to help with the kids...But my car sat in the garage. I wasn't able to drive for several weeks due to the type of reconstruction I had. After my surgery, doctors said I would need chemotherapy because my cancer had spread to a lymph node. I'm a real fucking sob story these days.

Last week I drove the car to the dealer on my way to chemotherapy and dropped it off. I took a train and several uber rides to get to chemo, my husband picked me up after treatment and drove me home. The dealer said the repair would take 2 days, and after a week he finally said 5 pm on Friday. I said I would pick it up Saturday and texted him when I was about to leave. At that point, he told me it wasn't going to be ready until Monday because the repair wasn't good enough and needed to be redone.

I know the dealer is the asshole in this story, but I'm also furious at my husband for not handling this 2 months ago as promised. I told him I need him to drive me to the dealer to pick up the car but he said I'll have to take an uber. I don't think I should have to go alone. I don't want to go alone. I don't even want to have to deal with this. Shouldn't he have to drive me? Isn't that the least he can do?!

My husband has... or, had a cat which he adopted several years before we got together. We've since gotten a couple more, but he always considered that one to be his original fur-child. I loved her too, which is why it guts me to share what happened last week as I was returning home from work one night.

&amp;#x200B;

The cat is a full black cat, and she roamed around outside often - something that I always didn't like and made me nervous, since we live in a fairly busy area where there are a lot of cars going by. It was dark when I was driving home, it was night by the time I got off work and as I was coming down the street she darted across the road just outside our house, I didn't see her in time and... you already know what happened.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt absolutely horrible and I immediately parked the car in the driveway and broke down in tears. I couldn't even look at the cat without wanting to vomit - she was definitely dead - so I went inside, and my husband was also out at work so I was desperately trying to calm down and figure out how I was going to tell him. A couple hours later I'd calmed down a bit and was trying to draft up something to say, when my husband storms inside and starts yelling and swearing, going on about how some fucker ran down the cat, saying he was gonna be the shit out of whoever did it, etc. I understand he was just angry and really upset - normally he's the calmest person I've ever met - but at that moment his rage completely shocked me and I just sort of froze up, and I didn't have the heart to tell him I'd been the one to kill his precious cat, even by accident. I was worried he'd turn that anger on me, so I just let him think it was some random person and grieved along with him when we got her out of the street and buried her in the backyard.

&amp;#x200B;

That was about a week ago and the guilt has me eating me alive, but I feel like saying something now after all this time would be even worse than admitting what I'd done right from the beginning. So, AITA for not telling the truth to my husband about his cat?

 I work at a printing company where we do embroidery and this guy came in asking if we can embroider a final fantasy logo onto a beanie of his. (Being a big nerd myself) I got excited and we started talking about our love of the game and it moved onto dnd talk and all nerdy shit.

But my boyfriend is very much on the fence about it. He says that he trust me but he doesn’t trust this guy at all. I argue that he wants to hang out with both of us, since he wants to make friends since he’s new in town. I even talked about it in front of my family and they also seemed very iffy about it. I’m not interested in starting a romantic relationship with this guy and my boyfriend views that other guys don’t have friends that are girls, unless they’re hopefully wanting a relationship or waiting for something to happen.

input: Throwaway for obvious reasons.

My brother got married recently and he had to deal with my grandma having concerns about his marriage. Mainly the fact that my new sister-in-law isn't particularly religious. My grandma is a devout Catholic and most of my family is as well. She was hounding my brother about how are the children going to be raised, what the ceremony would entail, etc. 

During the wedding I looked into the crowd(I was a groomsman), and I could see she was visibly upset and beside herself since the ceremony wasn't very religious. My grandma on the other side of my family officiated the wedding and just read some bible verses.

Now I am not religious at all, I'm an atheist but I don't like to say it. The last time I told someone close to me my religious beliefs, they ended a 4 year relationship just a few months later. So needless to say, I tend to keep it to myself. 

I'm not currently in a relationship so marriage isn't in my vision right now. I love my grandma, she's a sweet old lady and she's done a lot to help me over the years.

I know that if I do start planning a wedding, that information is coming out one way or another. She may just be upset about a non-religious person marrying into the family, but having one in her family would be devastating. 

Am I an A-hole for not wanting to marry until after she's passed away? She's pretty old but if the right person comes along and I do want to marry them, is that a valid reason to delay a wedding?

input: I did not bring up breaking up with him because he is in a bad spot right now, he just hasn’t been talking to me at all as of recently. We’re in a long distance relationship, so online communication is really important to me, but he never reciprocates. It’s gotten to the point where he replies to texts about 3 times a week total with a short message and we talk on the phone maybe once a week for an hour. On top of this, we’ll see each other in person maybe once every three months. 

Before you suggest talking to him about how I need more communication, I want to emphasize that I have had that conversation at least three times already, and the issue is only resolved for a week at most. Things go back to barely talking after that. 

He’s a really nice guy, but it just hasn’t been the same. I know I should stick with him through the hard times, but I feel like I’m getting more irritable and I just feel stupid waiting on replies and being hopeful. 

We’ve been together ~6 months if that changes anything.

input: So I've been hosting at a restaurant on the weekends.  It's only been for a few months and started as a favor, but I do more than just host.  Hosting isn't very demanding so I have downtime, and during that time I like to help out by busing tables or helping the servers with what is supposed to be their job in a variety of ways.  Some days I help a lot more than others depending on how busy it is or my mood.  But really, i'm not expected to do anything but host.

In time, one server has tipped me out several times on those nights I was helping a lot.  The other servers have not (only 3 servers total) ever tipped me.  Part of me feels bad, because maybe they would rather me not help because they'd just want to do all of the work themselves without feeling guilty or obligated to tip me out.  So, should I just stop helping?  Would I be an asshole to only help the one server who tips me out while not really bothering to help the others who never have?

input: Hello all. This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.

I moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.

Last week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.

Yesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.

When his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.

Am I being an asshole???

input: This issue has been plaguing my mind since last December and I am happy that this r/ exists because I need to know whether i am in the wrong or not. (If sharing please don't show username.)

My friend since childhood (We'll call her Sarah) has been giving me rides to and from school everyday for a long time because she lived right down the street from me. One day in Dec. after school, I was going to host a Secret Santa party. I have two groups of friends because Sarah doesn't get along with my larger group of friends. I didn't invite her to my secret Santa party because I know it would end in a fight if she did attend. In the past Sarah had been extremely jealous whenever I spent time with other friends. Anytime I would post a picture  with someone else she would message me and be angry even though I spent time with Sarah other times. This was getting old and I was growing apart from Sarah. I did plan on having another party, but it never happened. My group of friends took my bus home, we all got off at my bus stop where Sarah's mom would also pick her up so she didn't have to walk to her house.  I was planning to just walk a couple blocks with my friends to my house. Then, Sarah's mom asked us if we would like a ride home. I politely refused at  because I didn't want Sarah to be around other friends. Sarah's mom then says, ""No,its OK, I'll get y'all a ride home, its cold."" Without thinking, I agreed. Everyone got in her car and she dropped us off. I thanked her profusely and quickly got everyone to my house. During the ride to my house, Sarah said nothing. I look at Sarah as she leaves the driveway. As I look I see that she is crying. I was expecting the upset text from Sarah, per usual for being with others. I couldn't focus at the party. After opening presents, my phone rings. There it is. The upset text from Sarah. Crying and blaming everyone. I had discussed that I didn't think Sarah and the other group should spend a lot of time together, and she AGREED, but now she decided that she did want to be at the party with them? I received at least 15 other messaged with a a range of emotions. This typically happened when I spent time with my other friends, but this time I was confused on how to respond, because I was wrong for accepting the ride. I didn't respond until later in the night, now seeing 20+ messages. At this point I was SO tired of this jealousy every time I wanted to be around people other than her.  I finally snapped and told her we should not be friends anymore. To which she politely responded with, ""Fuck you."" I can't help to feel guilty for accepting the ride and not inviting her.

AITA for cutting off all contact with my best friend since childhood over this?

input: So my family was driving for vacation and me and my older sister are always fighting about who should be next to the driver( my dad).
So before we drove my sister said that she should be in front for half of the drive, and I should be in front on the other half of the driving to where we slept. I thought she meant that she would be in the driving to there and I would be in the returning to the home drive. So we drive to where we slept and on the last day she says she is going to be in front because I didn’t say anything when we drove on the first day( even tho I thought we agreed that she will be on the first day and that I will be on the last day, but she meant that she will be on half on the first day AND be in the last day all the drive) so I says that’s not fair but she said I should have listened. So after awhile of arguing she proposed that I can be on the drive back if I won’t listen to music with my ear phones. So I think this is bullshit but I really want to be in front because it makes me feel better when driving so I say ok. But I really planned to be on my earphones when she will sleep. But she woke up in the middle of the drive and said I can’t be in front anymore because I broke the rule. I said I don’t give a crap about the rule because she acted like an asshole and immature because it doesn’t matter if I’m on my earphones because its mine and this is stupid. But luckily my father sided with me and said the the rule was petty and for the rest of the drive I stayed with earphones. AITA for lying and breaking the rule ? Or am I ok because she was wrong?

Now complete the following example-
input: Names have been changed.

Various family members were down on hard times and because my parents worked so hard to provide for me and my brothers they were also able to provide for extended family that needed help. Because they have the biggest hearts, and the means to help, they immediately offered their arms and their home to whoever happened to need them.

Since the early 90's my parents were taking in family. They believed God gave them the ability to help so they should do so. No one paid rent. No one said thank you. But that was not why my parents helped. They weren't interested in clout or rent money... only in helping whoever needed them, whenever they were needed, and that was often.

In '11 My father's adult neice Barbara (his sister Denise's daughter) and her husband Gabriel and their two young kids Eric (6) and Ethan (2) needed particular help. The family of four moved in with us five. They stayed in our semi-converted garage and paid rent when they could. In the few years they lived with us, Gabriel and my oldest brother battled a heroine addiction. Barbara was in and out of work. Eric and Ethan didn't go to school.

They stayed with us for almost two years and in that time, I witnessed more verbal assault between Barbara and Gabriel than I knew possible. Police had come multiple times to the house.... the poor boys never knew structure or consistency. 

One night was especially bad. Barbara and Gabriel were caught in a shouting match, their boys crying on the couch. For the first time in her life, my mom had enough. She had the most patience of any one I've ever known and they drained her of it. She let them know that the violence was not okay, and they would have to leave if they couldn't control themselves in front of their kids.

In the next couple weeks they were gone. In the next couple years they were worse. Gabriel fought and lost his battle with addiction repeatedly. Barbara fell victim to the same drug abuse. They went from couch to couch. Often, Barbara and Eric would stay with Denise. Denise is an especially heartless person who would not welcome Gabriel or Ethan into her home. Gabirel was not Eric's biological father, so Denise was more welcoming of Eric than young Ethan.

Gabriel and Ethan would spend some nights on the streets. Some nights on our couch. Ethan has some language setbacks that hasn't been helped by his lack of structure or time in school. Over the years since they moved out my parents have helped get the boys in school, and get Barbara work, and get both Barbara and Gabriel in rehab. Time after time they abuse my parents' willingness to help, and time after time they are not willing to help themselves and continue to put them and their children in dangerous situations.

The most recent situation involves Barbara getting arrested after an altercation in Denise's home about a week ago. Child Protective Services took Ethan after Denise was willing to take Eric and not Ethan. Ethan is now in custody of the state at a childrens center. And Denise is planning on sending Eric to live with his biological father, a man he's never met, in Colorado. Denise wants nothing to do with Barbara or her grandchildren. Barbara is now in the streets with Gabriel.

Barbara has called my father pleading for him to take Ethan. Not just out of the childrens center, but into his home and raise him as his own. She pleads to her uncle (my father) saying that he and my mom have always done right, and worked hard. She tells them that they've been able to provide for me and my brothers and raise half-decent men. She wants the same for her son, and knows that she can't provide it and that he wont get it from the state's foster system.

And so ensues the current situation that is weighing so heavily on my parents hearts. All they have ever known is welcoming others into their home. They are actually more financially able to help others now than ever before. However, they are undoubtedly tired. My parents are fifty and this boy is seven years old. Is they adopt Ethan, they are committing to another 10/15 years of parenting. They would be starting all over. Not only this, but they would also take in Eric without second thought. They are now discussing taking in 7 year old Ethan and 11 year old Eric, and raising these boys and showing them love and structure and meaning like they've never known before. They feel like this is their duty, regardless of the fact that theyll be 60 when Ethan graduates from highschool and they finally have a chance to breathe for the first time in their lives.

Also in this time, my mom's cousin John has moved back in with my parents who now help raise his daughter Melina. Melina's mother is Tyra, my father's other niece (Barbara's sister and Denise second daughter). This only complicates the situation further. 

My parents know this is not their cross to carry... the boys have parents and a grandparent. But none of them are either able to or care to provide for the boys. So my parents feel responsible to carry that cross. I tell them they have already done more work for others than is expected in one lifetime... yet they are still called to help.

They are obvioisly hesitant to take on the commitment of raising two boys again for another ten years... but arent sure if they can live with knowing that the boys are either in foster care or in Colorado with strangers if they say no.

What is the right thing to do here? Have they done more than their fair share for loved ones who have already drained every ounce of help from them? Or do they have a responsiblity to take care of these children who need help, regardless of it being their duty or not?

Tl;dr-
My parents have taken in various extended family, rent free, for the last thirty years, including neice+her husband+2kids. Now niece and her husband are on the streets, losing a battle with drug abuse, and their children are displaced. They've asked my able-but-tired parents to adopt the children. My parents want to help but are understandably concerned about the huge commitment and responsibility. Whats the right thing to do?

(I understand now that she was seeking validation, but this is all realized in hindsight. )

She tells me that im not allowed to have an opinion on this opinion (even though she just asked me lol) due to the fact that i am a straight male. 

This honestly pissed me off, so from tbis point on im pretty unsure with the tone in which i spoke in.

I started off by saying that thats ridiculous and that people should be allowed to voice their mind on things, regardless of their characteristicks. I say that saying this would be like saying that she has no right to an opinion on anti-semitism because she isnt jewish.

She ended up getting up and leaving, but not before calling me an asshole and an idiot.

I DO get paid about $4 per delivery, and am allowed to keep and tips received (not that anyone tips in this college town. Maybe 1 in 10.) My main problems are:

I am partially disabled after a motorcycle accident. I had no insurance, could not afford treatment or rehab and have had pain and difficulty with an ankle and hip ever since. Constantly hopping in and out of my car to grab orders and walk to people's doors or dorms in sub-freezing weather makes my life unbearable. As in, unable to walk upstairs at home to the only bathroom, or sleep normally. The roommate knows this.

The other problem is that when I'm doing deliveries, I can't work (I rideshare fulltime) because instead of doing a day or two of solid delivery work or a couple hours a day throughout the week, he spaces out the deliveries, changes the schedule multiple times every. Single. Day. so I'm working for him 25-35hrs/we instead, and I can't accept uber fares on the chance I get a long ride or he scolds me for ""ruining his business"". Of which he has 3. Three business he is running (poorly) all at once.

TL;DR: I'm forced to deliver food with chronic pain/mobility issues, so I avoid getting out of my car and make customers come to me, in attempts to keep pain manageable. I can't afford to move, or I would in a heartbeat. AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: So my coworker took me out to dinner one night since we’re both here on a project and he paid with a company credit card. He makes a joke about how his boss got onto him for spending too much at restaurants while traveling some time and he mentioned it’s because he usually tips around 20% which I thought no big deal. 

Now for some context, my coworker has been working here ~10 years or so and I just started so he’s not exactly my boss, more like a mentor, so he does have some superiority over me(idk if that’s the right phrasing but hopefully you get what I mean). 

Where things get questionable is when the bill comes by. The total is like $69 before tip, so to tip 20% he puts under the tip $14. No big deal. However he did the mental math wrong somehow and put $73 for the total instead of $83. I noticed it but didn’t say anything because I didn’t want him to think I’m smarter than him or make him feel stupid especially since I’m new and don’t want to start things off on the wrong foot with a mentor. Now AITA for not saying something since there’s a chance that the waitress will only get a $4 tip on a $69 tab? 

I genuinely don’t think he did it on purpose since he just said he tips 20% and he’s also everything but an asshole. I just don’t know if what I did could be considered assholeish behavior.

Now complete the following example-
input: So, to preface I'm a (21M). My boyfriend of 7 years (22M, we'll call him ""Alex"") met this guy (17M, we'll call him ""Brad"") a couple years ago and everyone has been decent friends with the guy for awhile. More recently some pretty big arguments between this new guy and another one of our friends (21M, we'll call him ""Chris"") have been going on, but last night a more serious argument occurred which changed my mind about this guy.

Chris brought up some messages where Brad had confessed romantic feelings for my boyfriend Alex, talking about ""oh if only OP wasn't in the way"", those kinds of messages. I obviously was not aware of this, though I had some suspicions with how he acted towards my boyfriend. But apparently, my boyfriend was aware of this, and thought I had known.

I told my boyfriend I wasn't comfortable with him being friends with Brad because of his romantic feelings towards him, and the fact that he blatantly stated to Chris in messages that he wanted to be with my boyfriend, if only I weren't in the way. Cut to now, my boyfriend doesn't want to talk to me because I'm asking him to ditch a friend, and has told me that I'm being insecure for being bothered by this.

Ya'll tell me, because I'm worried that maybe I am being controlling, after all it is my boyfriend's friend, not mine. I'm just looking out for our relationship, I would've expected after Brad being friends with me and my boyfriend for about 2 years now and knowing that me and my boyfriend have been together for 7 years, he wouldn't be talking about having feelings for him anymore.

TL;DR: Messages showed a friend Brad saying he loves my boyfriend and wishes I weren't in the way, knowing me and my boyfriend have been together for 7 years. I told my boyfriend that it really bothered me and that I think he should drop Brad, and now he's upset at me. AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: A bit of backstory: I live at home still, with my girlfriend, and for a while we have endured listening to my mother saying incredibly racist remarks such as that she would never date Asians, saying Aboriginal Australians should “piss off” to the desert, 

Anyway, so just over two weeks ago we were out for a birthday dinner for my younger brother; it was him, my girlfriend, my mother, grandmother and  me. 

We were sitting there, all was going well. Suddenly, out of nowhere, my mother starts talking about how Muslims shouldn’t be able to live here (Australia). My girlfriend gets upset by this, as she is very sensitive on the topic of equality, excuses herself and gets up and steps outside. 

I however, remaining at the table decide that I should speak up against her. I said “can you please not make such racist remarks in public please?” She argues that it isn’t racism, and that her points are “all true.” 

I tried not to escalate things much further, so I simply said “can it just wait until we get home?” But she kept insisting on trying to convince me it wasn’t racist, and that if my girlfriend has a problem with it, that’s her concern. This annoyed me. I said “don’t imply that I can’t think for myself, this DOES upset me.” 

Anyway, I got up and said I’m leaving, and everyone else followed. 

When we got home, My grandmother swung around and said “Majora46’s girlfriend, don’t you ever leave the table! That was very rude. I don’t appreciate being called a racist.” It’s worth noting that nobody actually called her a racist. 

I said “she didn’t do anything wrong,” and my grandmother insisted it was embarrassing that she left, and I said “what’s embarrassing is sitting with people making a bunch of racist remarks in public.” 

My grandmother said to me “don’t you ever come to my house again, don’t ask me for anything ever again,” and I just said “alright fine, I won’t.” 

When I came back, I apologised to my grandmother, but she continued being hostile, as did my mother. I refused to apologise to the latter, because I don’t feel as if I have done anything wrong to her. She then complained about us (my girlfriend and I) laying around the house not doing anything, but that isn’t true.


I started to get worked up at this point. I felt as if I were being attacked for standing up against racism. My girlfriend pulled me back to the room saying I needed some space to relax, but my mother kept coming at me. She said I’m talking to him.” my girlfriend replied “he needs some time to calm down” but my mother started screaming in her face, and things kind of died down a bit after that

So, AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: Last weekend my (M26) girlfriend (F25) wanted me to visit her parent’s house with her. She had additional family members that would be present so she really wanted me to be there. I didn’t sleep much Friday so Saturday morning I had a headache. She’s slightly upset, but says its fine and she’ll go herself. When she left, I took two Aleve and laid down for 30 minutes. Earlier my two friends told me they’d be heading out to the desert to play but I told them I’d be at my girlfriend’s parents’ house and I couldn’t go. After feeling better (Aleve works quickly!), I ask in the group chat and ask if they’ve left yet. They haven’t, so I get ready and everyone shows up including their girlfriends. The four of them are on my lawn shooting the shit and I’m loading up my ATV.  My girlfriend’s best friend drives by (she just lives down the street) and waves at me. I didn’t even think about it, but 30 minutes later I get a text asking me what I’m doing right now. I reply “I’m not really sure”. Her friend definitely said something. She calls me and asks the same question. I tell her I’m feeling better and just made other plans for the day. I can tell she’s upset, so I tell her I’ll come over. I unload my shit and embarrassingly tell my friends that I can’t go. I drive to my girlfriend’s parents’ house and literally the minute I step foot on the ground, she storms out of the house and orders me to get back in the truck. She gets in and I pretty much get questioned as to why I was going out with my friends. She questions whether or not I was even sick. I inform her I was, but just took some Aleve. I don’t have a whole lot to say but I told her I don’t care for visiting her parents since they’re far right and often spew what is sometimes racist, bigoted and hateful shit. I’m Conservative (right), but not to the degree they are. Every time we visit my parents, they never bring up anything remotely political or controversial, so why the fuck should I have to listen to her parent’s spew their bullshit that I don’t care about? I only visit them because it makes her happy. She doesn’t say anything, and we go in. From the way her parents greeted and spoke to me, they knew I had avoided plans of coming. Maybe I should’ve been more transparent with her from the beginning, but she knew I’d also been waiting for a weekend that was clear weather since I just purchased my Raptor (been saving and desiring this for the last like SIX years – HUGE DEAL to me though not as important as our relationship) and I wanted to spend a day with friends messing around in the desert. We’ve always been extremely transparent in our relationship so I’m feeling shitty since I know she almost feels slight distrust in me now. She hasn’t been talkative as she normally is, and we haven’t had sex recently. :(

Now complete the following example-
input: Happened yesterday, and this happens frequently, so I’d like to know how some opinions on it.

My mum picked me up from my Dad’s yesterday to save me getting the bus back. Somewhere along the line, I made an offhand comment and it talked into a talk about me being trans.

(For details, socially transitioned over two years ago and have my first adult GIC appointment really soon.)

It started with my mum saying that she didn’t want to go on hormones. Fair. I get that. I’m sick of hearing it, but it’s at least a legitimate concern. 

Then it went on to discussions of me as a child. My mum likes to cherry pick, and was talking about how normal I was as a kid. I’ve learnt there’s nothing you can say to contradict her or she will go off the rails.

Then, after ten minutes of being pissed off steadily, came the kicker.

‘I feel like that little girl is dead. I’m grieving for my child.’

I hate that. For more context, I was really ill and could easily have died a few years ago, so this really rankles me the wrong way. I asked her if she thought I was an imposter, then, and she listed off ways I am worse now.

I got fed up and snapped. I told her that if she wanted to complain about me, not to do it to me. I already listen to her problems a lot (always have done) but this stuff is just not okay to say to me. She got angry and said she was allowed to have feelings. 

We got saved eventually by McDonald’s. 

Am I the asshole? Should I be listening to my mum’s complaints about me? Or is my mum the asshole for saying stuff like that?

Im a 17 year old in college and living with my parents while I look for houses. I have 2 rodents and a cat. 
My parents have a cat and a snake. 
Recently my Nan has roped my mother into using Essential Oils ""they will calm your cats down and make [Dad] love you more!""
So my mother has started buying and using them with my father backing her up all the way. My cat has shown signs of breathing difficulties since they have started using them.
I got mad. My animals were being affected negatively because of their new obsession. I asked calmly at first for them to stop. Showing vet documents from people who have had their pets die from oil usage. My mother blew up in my face saying how she wasn't stupid and didn't need a child telling her what to do. I retaliated (I probably shouldn't of but I was angry and worried for my animals) stating she was stupid for listening to brainwashing from places like Doterra. She stormed off abd my father had demanded I go into my room.
I've been getting the silent treatment since.
They still use the oils.

English is my third language, so apologies for any forthcoming mistakes, and feel free to correct me.

So a little back story, this summer my gramps had a knot in his digestive system and he had to be in the ICU (and still is) but his situation is going better, they're both old (over 75) and because of their health it isn't looking like they will return to Denmark. Along with that, two months ago or something, their house was overflown with water because of a waterpipe exploding in their apartment. (Edit: My grandparents are sadly both in Turkey, while i am in Denmark.)

Yesterday, i returned from a trip to Hamburg, and i had been sitting in a car for 6h, and at home my girlfriend was waiting me. Every time we go into my room, my mother gets pissy for not spending time with my family and she calls us *""Rabbits""* (Implying that we snuggle and have sex all the time) and i've voiced my disliking to that word, and she just said she thinks it's funny and found a way to justify her using the term.

I get embarrassed and uncomfortable when sitting in my room with my girlfriend when she acts like this, therefore i said that we were going for a walk, and we *did,* but we also went to my grandmothers' house to sit and chill in peace.

So we stay there for some time, kissing and snuggling, just like *rabbits.* she writes to me about 10 minutes after and says ""*If you're planning on going to my mothers' house, you better forget it now, AND I MEAN NOW""*

My phone was on silent, so i see the message an hour later, when i saw the message, i wrote ""*Sorry mum, my phone was on silent, we're coming home.*""

When we come home, i see anger on her face, fair nuff, i send my girlfriend home, sit in the living room and ask her;

""*Anything you wanna get off your chest?""*

And she goes on a rant where summed up she says;

""*You will never enter my mothers' house again, you hear me? I am* ***THIS*** *(puts two fingers close to each other) close to losing ALL of my respect to you, you hear me? This can go all the way where i* ***DISOWN*** *you.""*

She said more hurtful, but less important things. Little note, she doesn't even know what went on at grannies. My girlfriend and i aren't the type to mess a whole place up and make it dirty and all, everything was tidy and clean as it were.

Something else that might be of importance is to state, that *I* have always been a loving and caring son, my mother has several forms of chronic diseases which render her unable to do physical work (be it Arthritis in her joints or Osteoporosis in her back, she has it all.) I have always helped her with everything without sighing once, and just a week prior she was always boasting about how lovely a son i am, she would kiss and hug me saying that i am the pride of her live and that she loves me to hell and back. I have never done something in the past that has released such a magnitude of anger in my mother.

Now you be the verdict.

# Am i the Asshole for spending time with my girlfriend at my grandmothers', and also for being hurt at what my mother said?

This has been eating me up since yesterday, and i'd love some advice.

input: I (20M) am at university. Started last September. For some reason lots of girls think I ""must have slept with a lot of girls"". I have no idea why, but the reality is that I really haven't. I've only slept with 2 girls before university. 

Maybe I am better looking than I think or I have some.personality trait, but girls seem to think I've slept with a bunch of girls even though I haven't.  

Anyway once I found this out I just agreed and lied about it...I bragged about having way more sex than i really have. For some reason this made girls even MORE interested in me, and because of that I've slept with 3 girls since starting university....I don't think they would have slept with me had they known that I hadn't slept with that many people. I just lie about it because apparently sleepijg with lots of girls makes me seem more desirable.

Now complete the following example-
input: I am a married woman who was happily married up until a few days ago.  Recently my husband started talking about a new girl at work.  I thought, fine, I trust him, and he has other female friends.  

Soon I noticed the way he talked about her was different.  He seemed really giddy, almost like when we were dating.  It bothered me a bit, partly because she is 19 and I am 36, but once again, I trusted him, so I left it alone.  

Occasionally when he was texting her I would ask what they were talking about, and he gave me vague answers.  

One day I came home and found him talking on the phone with her.  This bothered me.  When he got off the phone I told him how much it bothered me.  I asked to see the messages between the two of them.   He said that they were private.  

He mentioned that the two of them had played a game where they guessed secrets about each other, and he gave his word not to show it to anyone.  I told him I felt this was too intimate of a conversation for ""friends"" to be having.  

He mentioned that she really didn't want her boyfriend to know they were talking.  Red flags went off in my mind.  I told him he needed to stop talking to her.  He refused, saying he didn't want to lose his friend.  

Eventually I decided to let the boyfriend know that they were talking and sharing secrets.   I figured I would want to know if I were him.  He said she had cheated on him multiple times before, and when he asked her about it she denied everything.   

After all of that, they broke up.  She told my husband to stop talking to her, therefore ending their friendship, and my husband and I are in a weird space now.  Am I the asshole for ruining three relationships?

This classmate of mine isn't part of the main three cliques in the class and he always follows me around in an attempt to fit in.
BUT he's really ""extra"" in a sense that he says things at awkward timings and butts into conversations that are not involving him. 
He doesn't really have the social awareness(?) and can sometimes say things that can come of as demeaning I.e he's really insensitive 
For eg of the times he talks about sexual stuff and about how easy it is to get a girl etc. To girls when they're clearly not feeling it.

But.....

Now complete the following example-
input: I've been 'BFFs' with this girl for 5 years (M), and she's been what I can best describe as using me, and our other friend (T) for her own gain. In high school, she would never have lunch and complain she was hungry, or when T and I wanted to go out during lunch she would say ""Oh I don't want to go I don't have any money"" and because we either wanted M to actually eat, or hang out with her, we bought her food. I have probably spent $1000 on food alone. T’s family has also taken her on road trips, all expense paid. M only got away with this she didn’t have a job, but we did.

It's now the second year into university, and normally money isn't really something I care about. However, I was starting to notice her taking more advantage of me. Her Xmas gifts are notoriously cheap. Now our limit was $50, and I went over it, but she went so under it. 2 years later, she bought me Elf Makeup and said it was $50. I calculated how much it could be, and at the cheapest it was $20, and the most expensive was $35. Nonetheless, I bought her a $50 gift. Last year was the last straw, and I kind of decided I was done with Xmas Gifts. She bought me a purse and claimed she spent $50, but accidentally left the $25 receipt in it. This wasn't my friendship tipping point though.

In Nov I bought tickets for a concert for both T and M. M was in class and promised to pay me back 92.50, and T promised to pay me back asap. She paid me the next day. M never did.

At Xmas she bought a fitbit for me (but not as a gift, so I still had to pay her back 156.44), and I paid back $100 at the beginning of Jan. Mid-Jan, I got kicked out of my house, and M had the bright idea of texting me the day after I got kicked out, asking me for money. I told her I was a little tight on funds, and at the time forgot about her owing me money (Keep in mind she was one of my BFFs, and I told her and T, the day I got kicked out.) She pretty much said 'No worries' and then hopped on the group chat and made plans to cheer me up a week later.

A week later she no-showed on T and I, so of course I brought up how frustrating it was, as she constantly flaked on us, and it was getting annoying. Once I brought this up, all hell broke loose. She hopped into my DM and said something about me owing her 56.44, but now because I took too long she was charging me interest. She wanted me to give her the concert tickets for free, and then pay for HER concert shirt to compensate. So then I just snapped. I paid her 56.44, and broke off the friendship. Since then, she's been talking about how I ruined *her* birthday, and I took away *her* concert ticket. I was being cruel to *her* on purpose. I wasn't being *fair* to *her.* She's been trying to get between T and I, and villainizing me. I've been told I should just apologize because apparently I'm in the wrong - but it just seems so obvious to me that she's just trying to antagonize me, and turn our mutual friend against me.

We’re all very active on LinkedIn. I got a message from a new sales team member (unrelated to my team and in a different state). He requested a call so we can talk about ""my perspective"" regarding our clients as well as my academic background. I found this weird because he mentioned my LinkedIn, where it clearly shows I’m entry level and have been here a few weeks. My more experienced coworkers are also visible on LinkedIn so I don’t know why he’s singled me out.

Now complete the following example-
input: My close friends consists of four of us. There’s my best friend and I (both 23F) who have known each other since 8th grade then there’s Jessi(26F) and Daniel(25F). We met Jessi and Daniel when Jessi moved in with my best friend. 

We all got close. I was very close to Jessi. She knows everything about. However, she’s slut shamed me, and made me feel disgusting for a lot of my views. She told me I had no responsibilities (a rant, actually) said hurtful things about my best friend and Daniel. 

I admit I shouldn’t have bottled everything up she was doing/saying but every time I tried to talk to her in a calm manner about something that bothered me.. she would get upset and blame it on something else/someone else. For example: I tried talking to her about BV and how her comments made me feel. Instead of apologizing, she directed it towards my best friend and stated, “she’s disgusting and dirty. She sleeps with men all the time with no condoms.” My best friend was only hooking up with one guy during that time and I had NOT mentioned her at all. 

I’m fully aware that I should’ve never let her say nasty things in the first place and I never agreed with her or said anything when she said those things but... it’s a hard position.

Now my best friend lives with her and had distanced herself from her because Jessi had said some very rude things to her in her face. Daniel already knows how she is.

I finally let everything out last night. I told them everything. I wrote a letter to Jessi explaining how I felt about things and left it in her room. Everything in the letter was said in a kind way.

After the big blowout last night, I didn’t say anything to her because I already stated how I felt. I told her she can talk to me when she realizes that it’s not us whose the problem.

She had asked all of us to speak with her but she only ended up talking to my best friend and Daniel. I was not asked to talk. She texted me saying she was over it and that if I wanted to talk to her that she would be open to it because she didn’t want to talk to me.

I told her I needed a few days to cool down &amp; to respect that. She texted me saying that I created the wedge between her, my best friend and Daniel. Reading that just made me cut the friendship off because the rude words that she said about them never came out of my mouth. I only made them aware of it.

My best friend supports me. Daniel, on the other hand. Is telling me that “She’s family and you shouldn’t cut her off. Give her a chance. Don’t be a bitch about it.”

And I get that... I would have been fine, partly, but that comment of how I wedged in between them was it for me. So am I the asshole here for cutting her off like that?

Now complete the following example-
input: This happened a couple of years ago. I was in a relationship with this girl who I felt I was in love with. The first couple of months were amazing with her, and we seemed to fit perfectly with each other. But then, things began to get tiring. Whenever I wanted to talk to her about anything, she would steer the conversation to how shitty the situation at her home is. I would stop talking about myself and listen to her and support her. 

There were a few months where I felt down because it felt like I wasn't able to make friends. She would always be by my side and glare at anyone who approached me. I noticed this and called her out on it but she said she did it unconsciously and apologized. And I let it go. 

Every time we fought, she would cry and tell me that I'm acting like her mother or her other family members. She said she couldn't handle it. I tried to approach her once about how it felt like she was ignoring me when I wanted to talk about myself for a change. I remember that night really vividly. She sobbed and wouldn't stop, telling me I was scaring her because I confronted her like her mother usually does. And I began comforting her and apologizing. Now I remember *I* apologized every time I felt something was wrong.

She's always been known as a sensitive person, but I couldn't handle it anymore. I was weak as well. Over months, I had stopped confronting her and standing up for myself. I was *scared* of confronting her. I was scared to tell her I wanted to break up.

So I told her that I had to breakup with her because my family found out (I'm from a place where dating is a huge no-no). 

She began yelling at me, and then after an hour she apologized, and then began yelling at me some more. It became a huge issue when she revealed that we were dating without my consent to her family even after me explicitly telling her not to. 

It took me months of counselling to realize that she was emotionally abusive. She was controlling. I'm very glad I broke up with her.

But, AITA for using a lie to do it?

input: A few times a week I go to the break room to heat up a breakfast sandwich before we open (I work at a bank). Several times in the the past few weeks I've gone to use the microwave and someone's food is sitting in there, done microwaving. 

The first couple of times I waited it out, but I am on a time constraint since I'm a teller so I have to be on the line ready to go at 9. Once I realized it was the same person every day, if her food was sitting there a long time and I was waiting, I would take it out, heat up my food (about 2 minutes for reference), and then put hers back in when I was done. 

She's come in a few times this week while I was using the microwave in her absence and seems annoyed that I moved her stuff. I'm not sure if her food is something that needs to be cooked in stages, which is possible, but I just want to eat before we open and tracking her down every time to ask her to move her food for me seems redundant and also somewhat rude. 

AITA for moving her food to cook my own?

Now complete the following example-
input: First of all, let me excuse myself for all the mistakes in this text, English is not my first language. 

I\[20f\] am studying Business Administration and for the past 2 years and a half I have cheated on 80% of my exams. I'm doing pretty well in finance and mathematics and those are topics i never cheat in because they require i use my logic, not my memory. But when i have to deal with 250+ power point slides of outdated theory I have to know by heart in order to get the maximum points in that specific exam, I just... put together a document with the info i need that i later upload on my phone. I've never been caught and i don't think i ever will be. I'm never reckless or too greedy with the attention i'm paying to my lap LOL.

I have tried memorizing, but i'm finding no logic chain that i can follow in the text and i eventually get bored/distracted/annoyed and drop it. I am currently working in the business field and never have i needed something they teached in those thousands of slides. I reached up to my superiors and asked them how much did college info help them in terms of knowledge and handling situations. 

Not at all.

So why should i sacrifice time if it brings me absolutely nothing?

What makes me wonder if i'm an asshole is the fact that i am getting a scholarship out of this. I'm not the only one who finds our school system and the theory irrelevant, but there's nothing i can do right now to change it, so i'm operating against it. Am i an asshole for perhaps depriving someone (that actually learns everything, knows it's just a bunch of crap, but doesn't have the nerve to cheat) of a scholarship?

input: I am the father of 11 yo twins. My twins don't know who the ""older"" brother is, because we didn't tell them. We believe the birth order of twins is completely irrelevant--they were born mere minutes apart, after all. Somewhat predictably, my sons are somewhat upset by that, and they keep asking me about it, despite our 11 yo old silence on the matter.

Telling A that he is technically older could make him feel smug or evoke protective feelings towards his ""little brother"". I don't want an essentially meaningless and irrelevant fact to affect their relationship. 

Needless to say, once they're fully grown adults I'll tell them who the ""older"" brother is, because by then they should be mature enough to realise that their birth order has no impact on anything.

I'm friends/acquaintances with this guy who is 23, turning 24 in a few months. He hasnt had a lot of luck with girls and often comes to me when he has a new crush to gush about them. The past four girls he has developed feelings for have been 18 or 17 and about to turn 18. One was 17 when he started developing feelings and told me he was going to ask her out on her birthday. I told him that I really didnt like that and he got upset that I wasnt supporting him and started that he was waiting and not asking her out before she was 18.

I've spoken about how I feel uncomfortable about it and told him in the end it's his decision as they are legal at 18, but that I wouldn't be enthusiastically encouraging him to go for them. So far all these crushes have lead to the girl turning him down, something I have wondered if it has to do with the age gap, so nothing has come of them. But he gets upset that I dont want to encourage him to go for these relationships.

Tl;dr: almost 24M develops feelings for 18F and thinks it's unfair that I dont encourage him to pursue them.

Now complete the following example-
input: So, we are not made out of money. I do have an awesome job and my girlfriends job pays her bills pretty much (not much opportunity to save). We live in NY, Long Island to be more exact. The cost of living here is crazy, but we somehow make things work. We discussed marriage and actually looked at a possible venue yesterday bc we were always talking about how amazing itd be to have the reception there.

So I told her, I want to get her a diamond, it may not be the biggest carat but silly me had it in my mind that you can ONLY propose with a diamond.  Diamonds are a girls best friend, right? I could buy her one but it would basically wipe out my savings (I am saving for a down payment on a house, well we are).

My girlfriend explained to me that a ring symbolizes the love we have for each other but in no way does it have to be a diamond. She would much rather that money be put towards a house, which I agree with. So we went browsing in NYC and she found a BEAUTIFUL ring, not diamond, but moissanite. Personally ive never heard of it but damn it was really nice and she lit up ear to ear! Not only was moissanite affordable, you can hardly tell the difference. Say no more! 

I guess why I am here is, my older brother JUST got engaged yesterday. He blew HALF his savings on a $21k (2ct) diamond ring that is beautiful! But I think to myself is holy shit, am I an asshole for not getting my gf a diamond? She made herself clear bc I confided in her about this, she loves me so much and I could propose with a pandora ring and she would still say yes 1000x. It made me happy because this is one of the many things I adore of my girlfriend.

AITA? Why does diamond have to be the industry standard? 
Thanks!

Now complete the following example-
input: Throwaway because my friends and bf know my username, sorry this might be long.

The title is a tad bit misleading, but let me start off by saying I love my boyfriend dearly. He’s a really a great guy and I love being with him. 

A little backstory: My [F/23] boyfriend’s [M/25] parents went through a very nasty divorce about a year ago. They were forced to sell his childhood home, and his mom moved into his grandmother’s small apartment.

After his parents sold the house, my bf moved in with his older brother and fiancée. BF pays them rent (a small amount, maybe a couple hundred dollars a month) but buys his own groceries, does his own laundry, etc. 

Now, this is my issue. BF talks about how his mom is planning on moving into a larger home because she wants her own place again. He says once she moves, he will live with her. At first he said he is doing it for moral support because of the divorce, but he then revealed he thinks paying rent is stupid. 

If it ever comes up in conversation, he will talk about how rent is throwing away money, a waste, etc. and how he will buy his own place instead. Now, this hurts my feelings because I have been on my own paying rent since college, but that’s a whole separate thing. 

As I mentioned, he says he would rather save up to buy a house, which I understand. However, I know there probably isn’t much saving going on because he always complains about how he needs to actually start saving and he’s so broke. I know for a fact he is making about $80,000 at his job, I don’t see why he can’t set aside enough to move out on his own. For reference, where we are, to live with roommates it would probably be about $500 - $800, or $1200 - $1500 to live alone. 

I think there is some insecurity going on, because a few of his close friends have already bought their own homes. 

So, WIBTA if I expressed these feelings to my BF? I don’t know how to approach this subject. I just think at age 25 it might be time to have some independence. 

TL;DR: BF currently lives with his older brother and is planning on moving back in with his mother once she gets a bigger house. He won’t  pay rent because he thinks it’s a waste of money. He says he would rather buy a house, but has put in little to no effort on saving money.

Now complete the following example-
input: This happened years ago but I thought I'd share. 

Friend = F

F started messaging me about how her college is racist and she is failing because of it. We are both Metis and have light skin, so it was odd. People can be very racist toward Indigenous People here but neither of us were noticeably Indigenous.

I asked for details and F said her prof had been asking her ""super hard"" questions during their classes and talked down to her. I asked F if she had reported the prof yet. F shrugged me off and said they ""wouldnt believe her"". 

At first I was like, ""okay fair enough."" But F was graded on only the midterms and finals which were all multiple choice.

So I said, ""You should definitely report it. If shes treating students like this she needs to go. How is it affecting your grades though if it gets marked by a computer? Maybe she's asking you the hard questions cause she thinks you are smart and know the answers?""

I asked mostly because I was hoping that there was some other explanation for it all.

I guess questioning her had angered her. I wasn't trying to offend her and was just trying to make sense of it all. F replied that the professor was just ""really fucking rude."" 

So I kind of just shrugged to myself and messaged her back, ""Are you sure it's because of race though? Maybe she doesn't like you for a different reason?"" 

This threw F into a rage. She ranted, ""you're white so you don't understand. Your family hasn't been through what mine has been through."" and ""if you dont believe there is racism in the schooling system we can no longer be friends.""

I was thinking of explaining myself, but I decided to just go to bed. I know there is racism and wasn't denying it.

(I will state that I dont tend to experience it myself because of my lightskin)

 I definitely didn't think it was relevant to bring up our families or my similar-to-her skin colour.

I still feel that she was over reacting.

But AITA for questioning her accusations of racism?

Now complete the following example-
input: Ok. Last night my partner and I were sitting on the couch together in my living room. I was playing Resident Evil 2: Remake and they said that it was very loud, so I lowered the volume from 18 to 14 (roughly 22%). 18-25 is the volume we normally watch TV at depending on the input source. At some point my partner says they need to get on a Skype video call (on their phone) with two other people. I say okay and they accept the call and put it on speaker phone at least 75% of max volume (as always). About 5 or so minutes into the call, this paraphrased exchange takes place:

Partner: God your game is loud. Wanna lower it?
Me: I already lowered the volume earlier.
Partner: Well, I can't hear my call.
Me: I can barely hear my game.
Person in the Skype call: (To my partner) Just use headphones.
Partner: I don't have headphones.
[I reach over and hand them a set of V-Moda Crossfade LP audiophile headphones with memory foam ear cushions]
Partner: I'm not wearing those. They're huge.

My claim that they are noise cancelling doesn't change their mind. Annoyed, I sigh and pause the game then remember that I have a wireless headset lying around. I go get it. Luckily it has a charge and I go back to playing my game until my partner ends their call 25 minutes or so later. 
After the call, my partner is still upset with me for being reluctant to lower the volume. I respond that I would have been less reluctant if they had asked nicely instead of barking at me. I also tell them that it's inconsiderate to be on the phone in the living room while people are using the tv and that it's customary to either use headphones or go into another area since phones are easier to move than tvs are. I ask them if they can see how they were being rude and apologize for it. They respond by saying they should have just not come to my house in the first place and go to bed.
The next morning, they are still upset and say that I was the one being rude. I hold my ground and maintain that they were in the wrong for both snapping at me and failing to observe common courtesy behavior. Suffice to say, we don't make up before we both have to go to work. Since we can't agree on this, I defer to Reddit. Am I the asshole?

well, I'm kind of the weird person that dates people online before meeting them. so I'm dating this girl, right? and we have been calling / facetiming each other and texting for a while now. about 3 months. so one day I told her ""goodnight, sleep well! text me when you wake up"" and she said ""goodnight, you too!"" and then in a desperate message she said something along the lines of ""almost told you I love you ahah"" I took this as kind of a hint that she wanted me to say it. so I kept that in mind. well, our conversation carried on despite us already saying goodnight and it being 3 AM. we were talking and getting really flirty with each other, like we do. but she told me something that she's been hiding from me- and rightfully so. apparently... she was married already. but she told me not to worry, and that they never talk any more and that her parents wanted it and that she didn't actually love the boy and all. it being 3 AM, I justified this. I brushed it off. at the end of the night, before we both went to bed, I told her I loved her- and I did. it wasn't a lie. but morning the next day I realized what she said. she's married. not dating someone else, literally married to another person. we were dating over the internet (with plans to meet btw)- how am I supposed to know she never talked to the guy. how can I trust her to be faithful to me if she couldn't to this guy- she said she dated him for four years before marrying him, and then she left him. how do I know she won't do that to me? I told her what I was feeling, and that I don't think I want to pursue a relationship and that we should part ways, and never talked to her again since that morning.

so reddit, AITA for saying i love you and then leaving, or is it justifiable being how easily manipulated I can be in the moment?

input: I've been together with my girl since 9th grade (about 8 years now). I know its about time we start to formalize things, get married and move together and all that but right now were both 22 years old, still in college and poor af. 
  
This past year my girlfriend has started looking at wedding rings, dresses and talking about our future wedding and all that. I understand her message clearly that she's ready to get married but I don't want to because its not financially wise to do so.   
  
Now I did make a mistake of telling her that I want to get married in the future (which means not now) and everytime we talk now its always about wedding stuff. She started planning everything and she's become a kind of bridezilla and I absolutely hate being around her right now. Honestly this kind of turns me off a lot and I told her that if she keeps this up I'll just break things off with her.  
  
She's already being super creepy about the specific shade of pink she wants everyone to wear, the $800 dress every bridesmaid has to buy, about how she has to fight with my mother for flowers and cake and all that. I think its extremely unreasonable to make people pay a fortune for a dress that will only be used one time and I'm certainly not ok with her fighting with my family. 
  

The constant wedding stuff brings unwanted and unneeded stress on top of everything going right now so AITA for telling her that?

Now complete the following example-
input: I am not that great of a writer so please bear with me as I try to start this out. I am 26, ex US Army going to college in a town near where I grew up. I just started dating a single mother about 2 weeks ago and it's like instant chemistry with all three of us. The boy's dad is an absolute dead beat, and being US Army I've seen plenty of those so I've done my best to make the boy feel like he's special and deserving of respect. 

I am also huge into DemoBass systems. My car is my passion. I drive a 2009 BMW M-series with the truck and back seat filled as best I can with sub-woofers. I get so much pride out of being the person you can hear coming from miles away. I've won local car and bass contests because it's something I put my heart and soul into. 

So here is where he stories cross paths. My girlfriend hates my system. She say's its obnoxious, it hurts her ears and it's a major sticking point between us progressing in our relationship. I tell her that I will always want to be loud and proud but I can turn it down when she's around. She agreed but told me she still doesn't like it. She also said that I am never to play my bass with her son in the car. I also agreed. 

Well yesterday, her dead beat ex didn't show up to pick up her son but she had to work. She asked me if I might be able to watch him for the day. I happily agreed. We were out cruising around and he kept begging me to crank my system up but I said your mom wouldn't like that. So finally we were at a light and some choad came up next to us with a weak ass system and finally my pride got the best of me and let Aiden absolutely crank the system. It was so loud and impressive that he was actually vibrating in his seat. We laughed so hard when the choad slinked away in his little rice grinder. I had the volume up for maybe 5 minutes before I said his mom wouldn't like it so we should turn it down.  All was good, five minutes of fun. 
I told Aiden we don't want to keep secrets from his mom but maybe lets just not talk about this and it was between us. 


So all was good, girlfriend was super appreciative that I watched him for the day and even started talking about the next night she has off and her mom can watch Aiden, she'll stay at my place for the first time. I was like on cloud nine. 


But then overnight I just started getting angry text after angry text from her because I guess Aiden told her about the choad and how we buried him at the intersection. I tried to respond that it was only five minutes, bass doesn't damage hearing anyways and he really loved it. She called me an asshole for violating her rule, she said I was immature for having the ""stupid bass"" anyways and her last text was ""we're done!"" before apparently blocking me. 

It's 541 AM here and I'm lost because things were going so well and now this? I'm just devastated and wish she would listen to reason. 


am I the asshole for this?

Now complete the following example-
input: This story has come to mind as it had happened 3 years ago when I was in university. 
We were assigned groups of three to design, brand and sell a FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) package.
Myself (OP), Mega B*tch (MB) and Nice guy (NG) were groped together despite barely talking to each other, we were the left overs that were swept into a group...

Day one of the group project and we had decided on the idea, we were to create a range of orange juice cartons, we had decided on color schemes, the name, all the basic branding. This project was fitting together and myself, MB and NG were getting along.

Day Two, in the morning I had woken up with a sore throat, dry cough and general aches throughout my body, my flat mates were experiencing similar symptoms and so we had decided to quarantine and stay in the flat. I had notified my group via Facebook messenger and NG was understanding, MB complained saying I was dead weight. After explaining my situation I offered to work from home (this was a design class and so I had all the software available on my laptop). MB refused, saying something like ""It wouldn't be the same"" If I were to work on it from home.

Day Three, Still sick, MB messages me asking if I'm going to be arriving to today's meeting. I had slept most of Day Two and so I hadn't seen this message yet. I said I would try to get out of bed but couldn't, I called the doctor and booked an appointment, nothing open until the next day. 

Day Four, MB has blocked me on Facebook and disbanded the chat group, at this point it's just me talking to NG, I ask if I can contribute at all and he declines, telling me I shouldn't participate.
I go to the doctors office, get a note and get my drugs.

Day Five, I feel amazing, the drugs worked and so I go to class, it's presentation day and so our groups are presenting their projects, Myself, MB and NG are called forward, MB tries to get a word in but the lecturer didn't care and shut her down, told us we had 5 minutes to sell our product, MB and NG had speech cards handy, I had my notes from day 1. we sold the product to the point we got an average mark.

I got my credits, had it placed in my portfolio and got an award for achieving a certain grade on all my projects. I explained my situation to my tutor and he told me I still did my part but I feel guilty that I was mooching off of the group,

NG and myself still keep contact and I even got him a job designing websites for a firm, MB still has me blocked and according to my other friends I get bought up as a mooch every once and a while when she has a few too many drinks... So AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: For a bit of context, earlier in the year this girl who I had been decent friends with was dropping a ton of hints that she wanted to go to her high schools' homecoming with me. I didn't want her to go without a date and she was clear that she wanted to go with a friend, so I offered to go with her.

The dance was alright, though we were never really that close of friends, so we only really had a couple of awkward conversations. During the dance I kept on looking for water or finding other friends so that we would have something to do/talk about. All in all, I was willing to do this because it meant she wasn't friendless at HC. 

After homecoming, things got a bit weird. From time to time she would approach me with really uncomfortably intense conversations, and got really close to me. Around then I was figuring that she liked me, despite the fact that I had essentially friend zoned her when agreeing to go to HC as friends. Asking around, a couple of my friends told me that she did in fact like me.

Things continued to be awkward until her schools Sadie Hawkins dance came around, and she asked me to it AS FRIENDS. 

At this point I was just confused. I thought going with her to HC was a mercy move, because her closer friends all had dates, but now she was asking so early that she could have chosen anyone else that was a closer friend. Obviously she was asking me as a date, which makes me wonder why she emphasized going as friends.

I lied and said I was busy that day, but then the polar vortex led to that dance being rescheduled, so she asked again. I knew I couldn't lie again, so I told her the truth, that I felt uncomfortable going to the dance with her. 

Things went back to the way they were, but she was still being uncomfortably intense, so I began avoiding her, since my words were clearly not working. Whenever she would approach me, I would keep our conversations polite and brief, then I would leave soon after.

AITA for doing this? I'm just really tired of dealing with her and I don't want to lead her on. My hope is that she will lose interest in me and move on to someone else, but I'm also afraid that I might kinda be the A-hole for avoiding her. Help!

Now complete the following example-
input: I'm a university student that lives in a house with 5 other students (two couples, and two singles, all close friends of mine). I spend a large majority of my time with the first couple and we hang out, play games, and watch movies together every night. The others in the house are always welcome, but are usually doing their own thing. 

Last week, the three of us decided that we were going to go to this Folk/Punk night at a rundown bar in town on Wednesday, and we brought it up consistently throughout the week. We invited the others, but didn't really have much hope since it seemed like it was going to be a weird and probably lame show, and they didn't show much interest. No one brought it up to us, or asked when we were going, so we assumed it was just going to be the three of us.

We ended up making a night of it, going to this art market at a brewery before heading to the show, and it turned out to be a lot of fun. Super weird, kinda uncomfortable at times, but it was good to get out of the house and try something new, and the music was better than we had expected. 

Since it was a Wednesday, and we had early class in the morning we were back to the house by 11. Two of our roommates were sitting on the couches talking, and looked unhappy when we walked in. We tried to tell them about the night, but they straight up ignored us and went to bed, only saying goodnight to each other, and acting really cold. This was odd, because like I said, we're all good friends who usually catch up at the end of the day. 

Today I found out that the reason they were acting so weird is that the one of them was apparently planning on coming with us, and was mad that we had left without her. 

So AITA for leaving, even if we didn't know she was planning on coming?

Now complete the following example-
input: 
To make this easier, I’ll come up with a name, let’s just call him Jim.
   
He’s an online friend the same age as me, and we’re both from Britain, and this year our year group has some really “important” exams. Thing is, my friend seems to be studying or doing homework *all the time*, he has maybe an hour free time every day which I find ridiculous because I have many other friends my age from my country and while they’re all mostly revising and doing work, it’s not like its completely invading their life, and I still get to see them and hang out for longer than hour intervals, y’know?
   
As well as this, I have a very big vendetta against the school system in this country, and he is well aware of this. Because of school and the way it works, as a person with aspergers, I have struggled immensely. I don’t know if trauma is the right word, but because of incidents with schools I’ve developed depression and anxiety. I can’t talk to any teachers or even consider home tutoring, let alone schooling because it causes me to have a panic attack and I just break down.
   
Jim knows all of this, yet if I ever criticise the school system or suggest it’s less than good, he gets annoyed. I’ll just say something like “It’s stupid how much homework they give you” and he’ll get defensive. If I ever mention the school system is harmful he gets mad and says it’s not and that it’s all just me, and my fault for “being lazy and not doing what I’m told”.
   
I’ve asked him multiple times to please just stop talking to me about his school problems because it leaves a bad taste in my mouth and because if I ever dare criticise the fact he’s tasked with so much work he gets upset. I have lots of other friends who know I hate school and avoid bringing it up often so I don’t feel uncomfortable, but it seems to be the only thing Jim ever talks or thinks about anymore.
   
We had a big argument a week ago because he was going on about exams again and I said that the people who run the schools are stupid or assholes or something like that. I don’t know if he agrees with me but is too prideful to admit he’s bending over backwards for a shit cause, or if he genuinely doesn’t see any problems because he has no problems, despite the statistics of school related depression rising.
   
I told him “I don’t want to talk to you anymore” and blocked him. He’s said nothing, despite being blocked for a week and me apparently being one of his closest friends.

Now complete the following example-
input: TL;DR: I can't deal with my youngest sibling and prefer not to be around him

I (young adult male) am currently living in with my parents and school-aged siblings. The youngest is in elementary school. We'll call him Charlie.

Charlie was an unexpected addition to our family towards the beginning of the decade. I should note that the sibling before him was born *nine* years prior. This represents a significant age gap and makes it hard for any of us to relate to a kid his age. 

Charlie acts out. Constantly. He's an unreasonably picky eater, has to constantly be told to do things like knock on doors or not stand on the furniture because he ""forgets,"" and in general just has no respect for other people or their personal space. I think this is mostly due to a lack of discipline and my parents being too old, weary and busy to properly raise him, but that's another story.

I should make it clear that I don't go out of my way to abuse or be mean to him. It's just that being around him at all is really hard on my anxiety. Hell, just being in an office all day wears me out. When I come home, all I really want to do is be in my room, alone. I used to be able to do things like sit down and eat dinner with my family, something which I'm no longer willing to do because all of our dinner situations are either Charlie wanting to leave the table and go watch TV or having to be coerced into eating his food. That is, if Mom or Dad didn't just take extra time to make him his own meal.

Thing is, I used to try to be more active about setting an example for Charlie. I would try to keep him from watching/playing violent games or viewing explicit Youtube videos. Of course, being in a shared home, I usually don't get the final say in any of those things. Any attempts to discipline him (as in, telling him to stop or pulling him away) will just result in my parents scolding me in front of everyone. It's just taken so much out of me, and I don't think it's worth the hassle anymore.

I'll still do things like make him food or babysit him if I'm asked to. That's fair enough, since I'm still living in the family home. I do those things out of duty to my parents. But outside of that, I just prefer not to have anything do with Charlie. I'm not mentally equipped for dealing with him and I think it's best for both of us if I keep my distance. I feel bad because part of me feels it's the responsibility of me as an older sibling to try to have a positive influence on him. On the other hand, I never chose for him to be born into the family. I'm fourteen years older than him and I can't relate to him at all. I also feel that my parents aren't doing their part in raising him properly, especially since they brought him into the world in the first place. AITA?

input: **throwaway because my guild uses reddit to communicate. i do know that lgbtq issues can be contentious and can be seen as baiting but i have read through similar posts i searched on this reddit and haven't found any very similar issues. i promise i am not trying to be inflammatory and will try to be as respectful as possible in my language.**

i am one of the guild leaders for a gay male guild on world of warcraft. for us, having a space to be openly gay around other openly gay guys is comforting. wow still has a lot of homophobia, especially in raiding guilds. some of us have also met up in real life once or twice yearly. general lgbtq\*, genderqueer, and lesbian guilds also exist.

recently, a new member joined our guild who self-identified as gay and gender non-conforming transman. in their words, they were born a female but dress in a more masculine style so they don't feel comfortable using a female identity, but also maintain female physiology and are interested in men. from the guild's perspective, there is no issue here and they were fully welcomed.

the issue arose in our guild discord server. we are 18+ and we have a #nsfw channel where we share adult images. this channel is opt-in, clearly marked, and not mandatory. when new member joined, they began to share some pornographic material of trans men (no bottom surgery). no one had an issue with this but they did not much attention if any at all because i think this type of pornography is less popular with our members.

new member complained in private that they felt excluded because other images shared got comments but not theirs. we let them know that they were welcome to share images but that people were free to comment on whichever images they liked. we didn't hear back. a few days later the user shared some revealing selfies. one user replied ""wow, looking good"" but then someone else shared something else and the attention was redirected there. the new user said the person who shared after them was transphobic and trying to drown out their images because it had a vagina and not a penis pictured (their words).

i re-messaged the user in the private that the drama isn't appreciated and that there was nothing transphobic about what the other user did and name-calling was unacceptable. the user replied to us that they wouldn't stand by if someone was being transphobic. they continued name-calling in the public channel so i didn't hesitate to remove them from the in-game guild and the chat server.

the next day, users that weren't online at the time saw the remnants of the conversation (i removed the personal photos for privacy) but one took issue and felt like the situation was transphobic. ultimately this led to a heated discussion amongst members. i loathe how much drama this has caused.

**was i the asshole or is this just a case of a very emotional issue bringing out a more heated, sensitive side in some people? thank you guys for reading all of this.**

input: So I‘m 20 and still living with my parents. I do a lot of stuff that my islamic parents don‘t approve of, like not believing in god, having sex before marriage, drinking and smoking yada yada

But I believe in being true to myself, so I don‘t really hide anything about my lifestyle, but we don‘t talk about it either.

Last week I came home late and began stumbling around in the flat because I was shitfacedly drunk. My dad saw me and asked if I had been drinking. I said yes, and he didn‘t have an answer for that. So I went to sleep.

Some days later he complained to my brothers about it, so one of them came to me and told me that I should have said no. I argued that I would feel like I‘d insult him if I lied blatantly in his face like that. My brothers‘ argument is that they know, but they at least want to live in the illusion that I‘m not doing anything „bad“. Like I just shouldn‘t adress the elephant in the room.

Now I‘m not so sure anymore. I feel like I‘d set my integrity aside for their comfort. They already know all my shit. I don‘t like lying to them. So, AITA?

TL;DR: Should I lie to my parents about my drinking, even though they know already? They say they’d be more relaxed.

Now complete the following example-
input: My grandfather was taken to hospital 3-4 months ago to the hospital because he was having a hard time breathing. He was moved to ICU same night and stayed there for 2&amp;1/2 months and after New Years was sent home.

He came home with a breathing machine attached to his neck and a feeding tube in his stomach and has one more for bladder, we were thought how to clean all that and got bunch of stuff related to his care, we had to hire a nurse for 2 weeks because even the doctors suggested they reckoned that’s how long it would take us to learn. This is all normal it can happen to any of us.( I hope no one has to go thourgh this tho.)

Now the part I’m maybe being an arsehole about, I’ve been working for 2 years since I graduated not the best but it was something rather then nothing. Couple of weeks after  my grandfather got sick I was let go from the place I was working in, bad wage, no extra pay for overtime since they found this method to cover it all legal no issues, they aren’t a bad company and all have been nice but I had to leave at 5-6 am for work and came at 8-9 pm (traffic is a nightmare). I had saved up money it was all good.

My grandfathers sickness required a lot and we had to pay for quite a few things and the most expensive 2 were nurse(3 of them coming whenever and whichever got time from their regular work.) and some medications which wasn’t covered we had to buy. Nurses cost nearly a third of my monthly wage in the company I used to work at.

A good chunk of my savings went to that while my father used what he earned for getting the bed and other items we require like the bed and the special thing it should be placed on so we can hone him upside down or straighten him and stuff.

I got a loan from bank for this as well and I’m paying it by myself and I have very little remain from my savings which I don’t want to give it to him just because he wants to get the best stuff rather then getting the mediocre ones. 

I may sound heartless and maybe at this point I am, this isn’t our first time taking care of a bedridden relative my grandmother was paralyzed when I was 6 and lived for 18 years I helped with that too and now helping with my grandfather.

Forgot to say my grandfather is 92. He isn’t conscious and more like in a blank state he doesn’t respond but occasionally stares ahead.

input: Some background info: I am a student in Turkey. Sometimes my moms comes to visit. I use Airbnb to rent an apartment so I can stay with her for the week or two she is here for. 



I rented this apartment and paid 1800 TL for 16 days. 1800 is like 370 dollars. 
First off, the apartment wasn’t as clean as it is. Even something as simple as the oven wasn’t clean! 

We go with it and say this is fine. It’s not big deal.
She texts me yesterday STATING she is coming to the apartment tomorrow to take some stuff from her room. I remain very polite and I say of course. Just let me know when before. 

She goes off saying it’s her apartment and leaves me some exclamation mark for asking when she will come exactly. I ignore her texts and I don’t know what to do now tbh. I don’t if she will just show up at my doorstep or what exactly.

I am just a bit worried she will kick us out or something since it’s her apartment and I only used Airbnb to book it. So basically no legal contract or whatnot. 

Am I the asshole for creating a fuss about her invading our privacy without even giving a notice?

input: This happened just now. Sorry if this is obvious, but I'm a little uncertain, maybe we're both assholes. 

My brother and I decided earlier today that he would pick me up from the train station because he would drop of stuff at my place and pick up my broken guitar. It's much snow outside now, slippery and I have luggage without wheels.

When I got to my train he texted me and said that he wants to watch a football game(EU) so he will be late/won't pick me up, because he thinks it will be entertaining. We started arguing, my point being that we had already decided that he would pick me up. I compared this with that if I would be the one picking him up and then said that I won't do it because I would want to be entertained, he would get mad at me. He then told me ""STFU, I want to watch the game now"".

I gave him a chance to apologize for the STFU and then I would take the bus home and he could come a little later and drop of the stuff. He then said that he has nothing to apologize for, that I'm acting like a spoiled teenager. So now my mom will drop off the stuff tomorrow after work instead and I said that he's not welcome until he apologizes.

Am I the asshole?

input: On the weekends my (M23) roommate (F23) doesn’t have, and she has a strange sleep schedule (4:00AM-4:00PM). She recently bought a puppy, without giving me very much heads up. She keeps it in a kennel while they sleep. So often I will let the dog out so she will stop yelping , this way I can focus on my work, as I am a full time student. Well the last two days it has had an accident in the kennel and wouldn’t quit yelping. It was the worst shit of all time, it’s still in the house a day later!!! So both times I woke my roommate up and asked her nicely to take care of it. Both times she did. But the second day she was obviously upset about it. Later in the day she writes a set of “dog rules”. Some where as follows.

•if taken out of kennel by someone other than (roommate) you are taking full responsibility of the mess inside and outside of the kennel.

• do not take dog out of the kennel unless taken outside and walk first or leave for whenever (roommate) is ready to take out.

• if you can’t handle smell, or noise,  you have car keys you can leave.

I told her that “if I take her out, so she’ll stop yelping, I will clean up any mess she makes after that point. Though I shouldn’t have to. Normal human beings are up at 10:00AM-12:00PM and have already walked their dogs. But those other rules, I am not going to follow. I pay rent to stay here and I need to study/do homework. Even if I am not studying and just watching TV I will wake you up. I shouldn’t have to sit here smelling and listening to your dog. It’s yours and you WILL take responsibility for it. You’re not gonna tell me to leave a place that I pay money for, because you want to sleep the afternoon away. It’s illogical and unethical.” 

So AITA here??? My boy Wyatt (my best friend/her boyfriend) thinks I am in the right, but he’s scared to say anything as this is his first girlfriend and he doesn’t wanna mess stuff up. Plus I ain’t no snitch.

Now complete the following example-
input: My now husband and I got married 1.5 months ago. We had 6 people on each side of the bridal party. This wedding took 3 full years to plan and prepare for. When I got engaged, most of the bridesmaids were very single, including Anna, the ""star"" of this story. Two of them were in long term relationships. I wanted to just give the two partnered bridesmaids plus ones. Anna seemed offended by this, because my wedding was then years off, and she was actually dating her now husband at the time (though it was casual. 

I eventually got pushed by my mother to give all of them plus ones. Anna actually continued to date that guy, and married him four months before my wedding at two months pregnant. She brought her new husband as her plus one (who I never met prior) and convinced one of the other bridesmaids to take her friend as hers (when she KNEW we didn't like him). 

She was hugely pregnant, and didn't refrain from showing it off. We're both fairly young (25) and in my husband's culture, getting pregnant before late 20s/30s, married or not, is basically a teenage pregnancy and drew ATTENTION. She also has a vibrant personality and has a way of eclipsing everyone around her. Her husband is also very tall and incredibly attractive, which drew a lot of attention.

All anyone spoke about or of was Anna's pregnancy and her attractive husband. Even in the line, people were asking about that ""electric woman"" and of her pregnancy/marriage/life. When they got up to dance, all eyes were on them. Anna's friend ended up hooking up with my brother, outing him as gay and causing a huge scandal.

I ended up leaving midway through the reception in tears, and never attended the next morning's brunch. Anna and her entourage left early the next morning and also didn't attend. I can't even look at the pictures without crying and desperately want a do over.

I'm not a bridezilla, but this was beyond the pale. It felt like a celebration of Anna's marriage. I'm sorry, but I put so much planning, effort, and money into this while someone that got pregnant without a thought and married spur of the moment reaped the benefits. 

I honestly feel like Anna owes me a wedding and did all of this as revenge for me offending her years ago. Am I wrong?

input: Last night my wife was having a going away dinner with a couple of women from work, so I’m at home with the kids. 8 o’clock rolls around and I go upstairs to put my down to bed and notice a car parked in my wife’s parking spot. My apartment complex gives each home one assigned parking spot, but there are open spots sprinkled throughout the assigned spots and also parking on the street. It looked like there was a pretty big party going on so there is no parking up and down the street. I thought about letting it go, but it’s our spot and the weather was nasty and I didn’t want my wife to have to walk far in that weather. I called the apartments tow company and had the car towed. I settled down to watch some tv when I see ANOTHER car pull into our spot and dash off into the party before I could situate my son and go say something....so I had their car towed too. It is the apartment complex’s policy to inform any guest that the assigned spots aren’t to be parked in. So I’m wondering if you guys think I’m the Asshole.

input: I have a friend who is in a graduate program and qualified for an all-expenses-paid semester abroad in a third world country. Friend has severe and debilitating anxiety even with medication. Friend went on the trip and could only handle about a week before coming home. Friend used up the budget for the opportunity so it was not possible for another student to go in their place.

My mother and I were discussing the situation and I mentioned that as someone who has struggled with livelong debilitating anxiety, I would not have accepted the scholarship knowing I'd never be able to make it work in my current state and the money could be repurposed to another student. My mother (also prone to anxiety and depression) tearfully told me that I was an asshole and that people with anxiety have as much a right to trying to live a normal life as anyone. 

AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: My father likes to get off of work, and hang out at the bar for a few hours before he comes home. This has lead to some rocky behavior, and he’s come home drunk before, but this time, it’s a long drawn on mess.

I (20 F) attended the restaurant for the first time with my boyfriend (23 M) and we ordered some chicken wings (remember this for later). The entire experience wasn’t the best. Service was poor, bathrooms were filthy, and one of our wings was completely undercooked. 

Almost every chicken wing I’ve ever eaten has some cooked blood near the bone that appears as a dark brown or purple. No big deal there. However, as my boyfriend bit into one of the wings, the consistency was wrong, and it let out a decent amount of bright red blood. He said it tasted like iron as soon as he bit into it.

When brought the the attention of my dad’s favorite bartender, who was serving us, he told us “they’re supposed to be like that!” We asked for one order or wings to be removed from the bill. They removed it for us.

Immediately after, my boyfriend posts a negative review of the restaurant (one star), mentions the poor service and gross restrooms, and shares a photo of the wing.

Two days later, I get a phone call from my dad while he’s at the restaurant. He’s Incredibly upset at me because of a review I didn’t post. He went in a rant about how the guys at the bar are “his family” and that now he’s embarrassed to go back, as the bartender showed him the review. 

I tell my dad that the bartender should not have given him a hard time about the review, because he (my dad) was not the one who wrote it. I was told that I needed to get my boyfriend to delete the review.

I protested this. For one, I wasn’t the one who wrote it, so I didn’t feel I should be getting flack for it. I told my dad the following: 

“It isn’t my fault he wrote that. You have [S/O’s name’s] phone number, so you should talk to him directly about it instead of yelling at me. “ 

I went on to tell him that my s/o is entitled to his opinion, and went on to say “bad business practices deserve bad reviews so they can change and get better.” 

My dad still insists that I somehow make the review go away. I can’t do that on my own, as I’m not about to take my s/o’s phone and do it, but I’m certainly not going to tell my boyfriend what he can and can’t do. I continue to insist that the review isn’t my problem, but this has only lead to my boyfriend not being welcomed into my parents house any longer, and some strong words about my “piece of sh*** boyfriend thing” from my dad.

Am I really in the wrong? I don’t think I did anything unfavorable expect for stick up for my boyfriend

input: This particular use of the word is something of heard from other areas of the world for years, but not in my area of the US.  As an example she might say, ""We should do something this weekend, yeah?"" or ""I bet you'd like some carrot cake, yeah?"".  We've lived in the same area for years and this is a new thing that she started doing in the past couple of weeks.  My guess is that she's picked it up from some tv shows like the mother on Speechless or maybe the guy from Expedition Unknown.

I told her I thought it sounds forced.  She replied with an, ""alright then""  and that was the extent of the conversation.  She hasn't said it around me since.  I don't think the way I did it was the problem, but my concern is that she was trying to add something interesting to her personality by picking something like that up and I squashed that.  What could be worse is that she could still talk like that around others, but not me, which I wouldn't want.  I don't want to be controlling, but over use of words like literally, yeah and ""I know, right?"" really do start to get on my nerves. I suppose I could be over analyzing this, but I figure I'd ask.

input: My friends and I have wanted to go the Old Spaghetti Factory for a while, and my mom planned with their parents for us to go today. I was totally okay with that.

My sister just got back from college yesterday night and I didn't go to the airport with my family to get her because I was in the middle of baking cookies with a friend of mine when they left, and they didn't make it seem like they wanted me to come. I was actually told it would just be my mom and dad who went, and that my brother and I would be staying home. In addition, they said the flight was delayed so I wasn't sure if we would even be going that night.

Now that she's here in CA, she's going with the rest of the family to Logan's Candies, where we've all been planning to go for a while. We wanted to go during Thanksgiving but we couldn't because she was sick. Now that we can,  I was super excited to go with them.

My mom just walked in and told me they're going while I'm at the Old Spaghetti Factory with my friends. I'm pissed as hell that they planned it this way. It would be one thing if I was the one who planned going with my friends since I would be knowingly interrupting whatever plans and actively choosing my friends over my family, but I had no idea they were going to Logan's until just now. I can't bail on my friends now but something makes me wish I could have gone with my family.

I stopped a year ago. I no longer have a case of woman-hating disease. 

Now my sister (25M) is a staunch feminist so obviously, it was more horrifying to her when she found out I was an incel (I told her). However she also can't seem to take a joke.

Anyway we were watching some shitty ass movie and there's a scene where out of nowhere this bitch of a character gets bitch slapped. In the context of this movie, i think she deserved it and the first thing I did was to laugh. My sister then said ''Of course you'd laugh, you were an incel and hated women. Don't laugh during scenes like this it's harmful as fuck''.

LOL wutt?? So I just said back (with sarcasm):

''Yeah, that's right. I was an incel. I've hated women and children. I've hated everything that walks or crawls at one time or another. And I'm here to hate you''.

I was quoting the Unforgiven lol but clearly changed the lines to make into a joke. Then my sister said ''Don't be a fucking asshole and make jokes like that. It's harmful and you're disgusting''. Wtf why is my own sister still acting like this?? AITA?

input: Tl;dr: GF went out with her friends. She then sent me videos of her dancing with two guys at someone's house. I got angry. 

Sorry if I get a bit incomprehensible, I've got quite a lot of drinks in my system. I'll give you a bit of backstory:

I've been with my girlfriend for a half a year. We knew each other for a few years but we started dating just recently. I've moved into her city for a university and we really hit it off. We've got a lot of in common, we like the same movies, we like to take walks, we have similar sense of humor etc 

The issue of cheating never really crossed my mind since everything was great. Her family likes me, my family likes her and I'm even planning to help her brother build a PC as a kind of bonding experience.

I never wanted to isolate her from her friends, so whenever she wanted to go out with them (a mix of male and female friends) I had no issue. But this Friday seemed a bit off.

I've been out of town due to some family thing and she went out to a bar with her friends again. I've been working well into the night so I expected some texts or photos from her, as was the usual. She sent some things but around midnight she sent me goodnight message. I asked her if she was at home, she said no and that she didn't want to text afterwards. I've been okay with that, she's been drinking after all.

At around 2 am she sent me two videos on Snapchat. In them, she was singing and dancing with two of her male friends at someone's house. I didn't see anyone else in the videos, so I assumed they were alone in there. She sent me a message at 5 am that she was finally home and going to sleep.

When I saw that in the morning, I got really angry. I didn't tell her though, even though I probably should. She even asked me if I'm angry and I said no but I'm pretty sure she can tell that I'm not ok since I haven't been texting her at all.

Am I wrong to get angry in this situation?

Now complete the following example-
input: Some backstory, about a year ago our roommate moves in with my fiancé and myself. Met him from Craig’s list seemed cool shared a lot of the same interests as us. We had a generous price for the room and utilities, about 40% of the total rent and utilities, and since he was struggling getting hours at work he really wanted the room. Problem was he had a cat and the complex has a strict no pets rule. Found he could claim the cat as an Emotional Support Animal then we would be fine to move in. Helped him get that sorted, I payed for his pet deposit which was 50$. Great all set to move in, he said he’s moving in on the 14 of the month. We didn’t care about the day but then he said he’s only paying half the months rent. Kinda annoyed but my fiancé and I do ok enough financially and we know what it’s like to struggle so we said ok half of the rent. We also smoke weed and he did as well, we smoked him out constantly and he never offered any back. Everything goes fine-ish for about 6 months complaints here and there about the dishes piling up which is 99% our fault since he doesn’t cook and was totally. He started looking for new jobs for better pay, found one and got fired, found another job and one that paid way more. He knocked on the door to my fiancé and I’s room crying with laughter excited for his new job. We were close at the time and he said “I was so excited I just wanted to tell someone”. After that he goes full ghost on us never says more than hi or sup. Won’t answer texts, discord, nothing. See him occasionally in the kitchen when he uses the microwave and that’s hit. Recently my fiancé left the stove on, and my roommate noticed and turned it off. Came to talked to me about he saying it was irresponsible and that the safety of his stuff and his cat could have burned away. I kinda shrugged it off this kind of thing happened occasionally I won’t lie. I had kinda a shit week (not saying this justifies it just giving details). I guess he didn’t like the way I reacted so he talked to my fiancé about it and I guess they got kinda heated. About a couple months ago he says that we need to be quiet by 11pm, we say we’ll try our best but we’re both night owls and play games late at night and shit get heated some times ya know? Tonight I was playing games with friends and my fiancé and I got too loud again and he sent my fiancé a text saying “I guess this isn’t going to end. I’m moving out”. We tried to be good roommates but you be the judge reddit AITA?

TLDR: Tried to accommodate our roommate as much as possible financially and as a friend. Starts ghosting us when he gets a new job only talks to us when he has a complaint and is trying to set our bed time because his work schedule.

Anyway, I had been getting along with my in laws reasonably well lately and was approached last month when they planned this and they said they’d love to have the party at their house and they’d pitch in for food and decorations and invite my family and only certain family members on their side as quite a few of them are drama filled, toxic people. 

Now less than a week before hand, I find out she’s invited 4 whole families from the extended family I had not agreed on. No heads up or anything, just invited them all. I don’t really have a big problem with most of these people, I stay out of drama and after almost a decade of being a part of this family, they leave me out of it. Now here’s the part where I might be an asshole. One of these families is my father in law’s sister. She has a history of severe depression and doesn’t have much family of her own in the area. She’s a lovely person, she loves my kids, and they love her too. She’s been very depressed lately and so my in laws invited her to the party. I like to keep parties small and wanted just immediate family and wouldn’t normally have invited her, but whatever, that part isn’t the big deal. Here’s what is: her new husband is hugely racist. Uses the N word frequently, says things like “people should keep to their own kind” referring to interracial couples. Reminisces of segregation, thinks only white male land owners should vote, etc. Also is VERY vocal on such issues. Most of my husband family chalks it up to him being “from another generation”. I think that’s utter bullshit and shouldn’t be tolerated from anyone no matter their age. I don’t want him there, ESPECIALLY after my mother in law invited my sibling who is in an interracial marriage and has three young children who shouldn’t be exposed to such hate at their cousins birthday party.  I understand this is their house and they have the right to invite who they want. So am I the asshole for insisting he not be there whether or not the aunt will come?

Now complete the following example-
input: TLDR- dude below me vomits multiple time a day; now my room is starting to smell like vomit


So I live in an apartment that has one floor above me and one below me. The walls are EXTREMELY thin, so we all can hear each other all the time. Since my lease started in August, I’ve noticed that I hear the sound of vomiting every morning and every afternoon. It is very obviously vomiting and it happens multiple times a day, every day, without fail. Although it’s a bit disruptive and gross to hear, I’ve never said anything because like, obviously the guy is having a rough enough time as is; I’m sure he doesn’t want to be puking just as much as I don’t want to hear it. 

Lately though, as it’s begun to heat up, my bedroom has begun to smell like puke. You know that smell after you clean up puke but it still lingers? Like that. I figure it’s coming from his bathroom that is probably directly below me. 

Would I be an asshole for calling the leasing office about this? I’m honestly not even sure what they could do besides notify him about the fact that others can hear/smell it.

Now complete the following example-
input: The past two months have been pretty drama-filled among me and my various friend groups, sides have been taken, all that petty bs. All of it stemmed from my actions coming out of a relationship. This girl (19f) and I (20m) were together for about a year and a half. Things were great for the first year or so, but then we started to have some issues that ultimately ended in her breaking it off with me. Both of us knew it's probably what was best, but she was the one to make the final decision, and we ended things rather amicably.

That being said, I struggled initially as I had grown quite accustomed to the relationship and was at a loss now that it wasn't there anymore. My emotional state was probably the worst it's ever been, and my doctor put me on Xanax when needed for about a week and a half immediately following the initial onset. After the first week of having my emotions regulated and viewing the situation from mostly a logical standpoint, I came to grips with the fact that we had a *very* unhealthy relationship. My life improved, I had more motivation to do things for myself, etc. I made a tinder a few weeks after we broke up, and matched with this girl I had had an English class with a year or so ago. On our first date, it turns out that this new girl (NG) had recently met with my ex through a mutual friend, and they were now part of a friend group. They weren't really friends, more like acquaintances, at least according to what NG told me. I figured it wasn't a big deal since my ex broke up with me, and they weren't good friends. We continued going on dates periodically, and we eventually decided that neither of us really wanted to get into a *serious* relationship right now as we were both fresh out of long-term relationships. And then it got out that we were ""seeing"" each other, and that's when things went south.

My ex refused to talk to me for a few days, and was very upset with me, claiming that what I did was disrespectful to our relationship, and proved to her that the time I spent with her meant nothing. This obviously isn't the case; I loved this girl so much, but things just didn't work out and I was okay with that. This led into a few weeks of drama consisting of their friend group telling NG to just stop talking with me, and them eventually just straight up not talking with NG anymore. 

Jump ahead about two weeks, and it gets out that NG and I had made out w each other after one of our dates a few weeks prior. Everything had started to calm down, but this really just made everything flare up again. It's something I regret as I think it was something I did just because I missed the physical intimacy of a relationship, and wouldn't do it again if I was given the chance. 

That being said, I believe that my actions weren't asshole-y as she was the one to end the relationship. Isn't it my choice as to when I'm over the relationship and ready to move on?

input: Let me start by saying I used to be a pizza delivery guy, so I worked for tips and completely understand how it can be. So when I get pizza delivered, or I'm at a restaurant sitting at the table with a waitress/waiter I tip really well. Usuaully at LEAST 25%. 

Having said that, when I get a carry-out order, or the one that annoys me the most, when I go into a regular deli or something and order at the register, I never tip. In fact I actually get annoyed at the second one. I just ordered a sandwich at a deli and there was a tip jar sitting there and the receipt asked for a tip. 

WHY?? 

I worked in retail for countless years and never even remotely asked for a tip. Why the fuck is it somehow OK for it to be different because food?

input: For a school project my friends and I were paired up with a kid who usually keeps to himself. He usually sat by himself at lunch but we invited him to sit at our table to discuss the project. We even exchanged phone numbers and social media. After the project was over he continued sitting with us which was fine until he just started talking about his depression with us and how bad his life is and just bums us out and makes things awkward. When we sit with him there are topics we can’t discuss because when we do he looks really depressed (An example was yesterday when we were discussing plans we had with our girlfriends). Apparently he called my friend really late at night because he needed to talk to somebody. He tells us his problems almost everyday and always thanks us for being friends with him and that he’s glad he can talk to us. We’ve asked him to stop telling us these things and that he should seek professional help but he says his family can’t afford it. I have no problems being friends with him but I really don’t want or think I’m suited to be his personal therapist. My friends are saying if he doesn’t stop they’re going to ask him to go back to sitting alone because he’s starting to make them feel depressed and I kind of agree.

Now complete the following example-
input: Throwaway account

I played lords mobile a few months ago and I joined this clan. As it is a pay to win type game my wife only let me spend 15 a week which I used mostly on heroes. This allowed me to get moderately powerful and I made a few friends. I met this dude (I am assuming he is a he and not the she he said and we will get to why later it’s important) who posing as a female (again assumed) recruited me to his guild out of mine. 

He attracted me with saying he was good friends with the top guild protection yada yada. And did pretty good Sith Lord role play which I found entertaining so I joined. He was overly flirtatious and after I joined the line app group he/she decided to try to keep me from going else where by giving himself/herself to me and sent me supposed pics of herself. 

Before even thinking about reverse image I could tell things were amiss as the images were not of the same person. Not to say the bodies weren’t similar but my suspicion was confirmed when reverse image look up showed was a rips from two different Swedish instagrammers and he/she claimed to live in Florida. 

Now I admit I didn’t tell my wife what I found or what was happening and I regret that but essentially I decided to play along but worked in the back ground to destabilize the guild. 

Read:I made a dummy account and through it fed her details to bad guys and generally did what I could to destroy her as by the end it came out she was doing this to like 9 other people and would commonly just send out straight porn and claim it was her (no face, but I will say he learned how to gain and lose a tan fast) my wife says i crossed a line even though I didn’t send pics I just sent words.

I showed her all the conversations and my evidence that manipulation was at hand and that I was merely enjoying the mind games cause I am a truck driver and traffic makes me feel like being evil sometimes but we disagree on what we call it. She admitted she knows I’d never do anything physical but she think I went to far with the ruse and I should have called him on his bs and moved on. 

I stopped playing lord’s mobile since and behave. The wife has forgiven me but we are working to rebuild trust. 

So Reddit, am I the asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: First time posting here. The title sounds awful but let me explain.

A little detail about me, from time to time, I like picking up or dropping off people (that I know) on my way to or back from school since I think that It's a nice thing to do, you know, save em a mile of walking or even money (bus rides). I drive a van at the time so, plenty of room. The girl that I picked up is someone I knew since elementary and middle school. My then girlfriend, NOW ex, and I were dating for about a months so I was in that phase where I wanted to impress her by showing her, or in this case, telling her how caring I can be.

The day before this all went down, I asked my girlfriend If she was down to go on a movie date with me, to which she replied with a happy ""yes"". Fast forward a day and It's around 4pm. I got out of work and was on my way to Walmart. While driving I saw a girl that I knew from Elementary and her family, 3 younger siblings, one looked like she was about 15 years of age, the other two looked no older than 7-8, along with her mother and what I assume to be her bf/brother, walking out of Walmart with heavy baggage. Thought nothing of it, went into Walmart got what I needed and left. Drove back from Walmart, I saw the same girl and her family. Still carrying heavy looking groceries. The kids year old were carrying 2 bag each, looking a little too heavy. The bf/bro had a bag of coals on a should and bunch bags with on the other. Everyone had something to carry. Feeling sorry, I pulled over, waited for the family to reach my van, which I then got out of the van and asked if they'd like a ride home and that I wouldn't mind. They reluctantly agreed. I helped loading their groceries onto my van and asked for their address We were off. The family thanked me after I dropped them off at their house and apologized for the inconvenience, which I didn't mind. I was happy to help.

Later that day, 5:45pm, movie starts at 6:10, I picked up my girlfriend and we were off to the theaters. Wanting to brag to her about how caring of a boyfriend I am. Told her that I saw an old friend from elementary, who happens to be a female, and her family, walking with a heavy load. Offered to give them a ride home. My girlfriend goes silent throughout the whole ride to the theater. Half way through the movie, she silently blew up at me for, and I quote, ""Picking up a slutty bitch in the streets and having the balls to tell her about it"" That REALLY took me by surprise. Baffled, I said ""Wait what? That's what you took from my story? I picked up a FAMILY not just A girl"" Kid you not, she replied ""Her family's not the problem here. You don't talk to your girlfriend about picking up sluts"" I didn't want cause a scene and left with her. I tried explaining to her once more on the way out but she just kept saying the same thing over and over. Eventually I gave up and apologized for picking up a girl, dropped her off at her place and didn't message her that night. AITA here?

input:  To be honest, I really don’t know how to title this one without giving the whole story away so here it goes. My boyfriend (30M) and I (25F) rent a house together in a nice town by the ocean. We have an great landlord that can sometimes be weird but otherwise he is a good guy. The other day I was home alone, smoking some weed and cleaning around the house. There was a knock and doorbell ring at the door, so obviously I go to answer it (and spray some febreze first lol). Random guy says “Hello I’m so and so from a local solar panel company and I was wondering if I could come in and take a look inside the house and the attic.” I glance behind him and I don’t see a car with any solar panel company logo. I say something along the lines of no, I wasn’t informed by my landlord that anyone would be stopping by so I’m sorry but have a good day. He insisted. He said something like please I’m supposed to do this, are you sure he isn’t here etc. etc. I again say no, told him to call my landlord then and proceeded to shut the door. That was that, stranger saunters off. 

 Later on that day, landlord stops by and is kind of annoyed with me. Landlord says“ that guy drove two hours to come here and you just sent him off like that. You should buy him a six pack or something to say sorry!” He kept going on about it. I told him next time someone is stopping by to inform me because I will never let a stranger in the house regardless if I am alone or not. 

 Also, I did not mention this is not the first time he has sent someone by without informing me and I have shut the door in their face. I don’t believe I am in the wrong here but I also am hyper aware of crimes/rapes/murders that have happened because of situations like this. I am not sure if I’m being overly cautious because of all of the terrible shit I read and if I’m the asshole here and owe some people apologies.

Now complete the following example-
input: I have a group chat with a few friends for the purpose of getting together and doing things, as well as just having fun and messing around. We like to get together every once and a while to hang out, and do some recreational activities. We all have fairly busy schedules, as we are all adults, so planning on doing things together can be a bit of a hassle sometimes. It’s nice to be able to get together at least once a week, but sometimes not even that is possible because our schedules don’t line up. 

I understand that people get busy and sometimes plans don’t work out, that’s just life. I’ve noticed however whenever I pitch an idea to do something on a particular day, not ONCE has the plan actually gone through. I’m understanding if my friends are busy and it doesn’t work for them, but when they say “that’s a great idea, let’s go!” or “works for me!” Isn’t that kind of expected that they should be able to go, or am I just crazy? It also seems when any of them make plans, it usually works for most of them and goes through. It kinda makes me feel like a shitty person how I try to make plans with my friends and it seems like they don’t really give a shit.

This most recent incident, I asked a few days ago if anyone wanted to get dinner, where two of my friends said they could go and one said they probably couldn’t. When the day arrives, I ask where everyone wants to go and I get no responses. Half an hour after we were supposed to meet up, one of my friends messages us saying that they have too much to do and can’t make it. The other friend straight up doesn’t respond. Third friend doesn’t either but they said they probably couldn’t anyways so I wasn’t upset about that. I reply “awesome, I guess I’ll just let you guys make all the plans since all of mine fall through.” Nothing. They even read it too. 

I then said: “cool, I guess nobody gives a shit,” and left the group chat. Now they’re individually messaging me but I’m not gonna respond because I don’t care about their justifications for being shitty friends. If you say you’re going to an event or enthusiastically respond in such a manner, then I don’t know why it would be unreasonable for me to be upset when it falls through last minute. Now if this happened once, it wouldn’t be the end of the world, but it seems like every damn time I try and set something up, this shit happens.

It makes me feel like trash when this happens. I still like hanging out with them, but it feels like it’s on their terms and never mine. Are my feelings justified or am I just being an asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: So I was brought up in a pretty conservative Pakistani household and had Islam burnt into my mind throughout my childhood and teenage years (praying five times a day, reading the quran, going to the mosque every week, fasting during ramadan). I was utterly devoted to the religion to the point where I voluntarily memorized about half the quran (it’s a pretty huge book). 

After starting college 3 years ago and learning more about evolution and scientific theory in general, I stopped being able to reconcile science with religion. I chose to believe in science because it actually offered evidence for the ideas it promoted. I haven’t prayed or read the quran for almost 3 years but I’ve been pretending to still be Muslim in front of my parents and relatives. Most of my friends know I’m an atheist and they’re pretty chill about it. 

I recently went on a trip with my dad for a few days and he asked me if I still prayed. Because he’s always been the more open-minded of my parents, I decided to take a chance and tell him part of the truth (that I had doubts about religion and that I didn’t really pray anymore). He promised not to tell my mother and seemed to be have taken it well during the trip. 

Well, imagine my surprise when I found both my parents crying after I got back from work the next week. He’d not only told my mom what I confided in him, but was now demanding that I go talk with a mufti to “clear my doubts”. My mom kept saying “you’re gonna lose your entire family if you don’t come back to Islam”. I told them I have nothing against other Muslims but I personally just can’t believe in religion anymore. When they realized I was being serious about this, they told me if they died, it would be my fault. My dad said “if Islam didn’t prohibit it, I might’ve already killed myself because of this”. 

My parents have always supported me, financially and emotionally. They brought me up with love and made sure I never wanted for anything. I’ve always loved and respected them and tried to be a good son. Now they say that I’ve destroyed my life and theirs by not believing in God anymore and made their lives meaningless. They think that I should follow the religion if only to repay their kindness and love. 

I feel very guilty about my part in all this. Obviously, I should never have told them about my beliefs and just kept pretending. But now the cat’s out of the bag and I’ve messed everything up. If I’m the asshole in this scenario, I’ll try to go back to praying daily and reading the quran, but is it really that bad of me to wish my parents loved me unconditionally?

Now complete the following example-
input: So here's the context.

Our high school's Junior Student Council (JSC) came to me asking if I'd like to help them set up our school's 3rd prom night. Having the equipment (i.e speakers, mixer, cables, etc..), I said sure, but for a price.
 
JSC agreed to put the rate of $9.51/hr (PHP500/hr)  for my equipment and I threw in free service into the deal in their proposal (as they're the ones assigned to make the event happen this year).
 I also explained that they were paying for 1/55th of what the equipment  orignally cost (basically $2091.15+ or PHP110,000+) 

1 week later, I hear back from them.
Apparently, the school admins rejected the offer, saying that I ""should be willing to do it for free"".


AITA?

I‘d like some advice or insight on this as I‘m still relatively confused on what I should be doing/saying.

Now complete the following example-
input: *TL;DR: I can get annoying from the intensity of my interests and how much I talk about them, I got put in my place, but felt attacked and don't know if that's a reasonable reaction or what to do about it.* 

This is a pretty small issue, but here goes.

I have a group of good friends ranging in age from older teen to young adult. We have a couple group chats (various circles of people) that we chat on. My friends and I have ADHD and/or autism, which means we struggle with social cues and sarcasm. We also tend to get really, *really* into things and talk about them a lot. It can be difficult to shut up, but I try and I at least make sure that other, especially less assertive, people have space to talk too. We also all have anxiety. All of us are aware of each other's quirks and struggles and are supportive.

I really like my original characters, and I talk about them a lot. Like, a *lot*. But they get why I'm so interested and they love to discuss their own characters with me and we go back and forth. My friends jokingly hate two of my characters because they're villains, and they make fun of me sometimes because I defend the characters and my love for them. This is almost always funny for everyone involved and it's a nonissue.

Yesterday, I compared one of my characters to a different, video game, character that they really like. This offended my friends (longer story, but yeah it was insulting, I get why they're unhappy) and they started teasing me and making memes about my mistake and about me being so obsessed with the character that I can't not reference him everywhere. When I got embarrassed and asked them to stop, they just posted the memes in a different chat so more people can see. I don't think they realized I was serious, I didn't make it super clear (again, we suck at social cues) and that's my own fault. They've talked about unrelated stuff since, I felt too ashamed to participate. I left one of the chats this happened in and am considering leaving the others until I'm less embarrassed and until the jokes are buried under more conversations. I'll come back later, try a lot harder to stop referencing this interest, because this is deffo not friendship-ending material and they like me otherwise. It feels so childish to be upset over something so small and even more childish to ask them to stop because I'm taking this way too seriously...

AITA for being so upset about this, and for leaving? How should I fix this?

Now complete the following example-
input:   

My roommate moved into my fully furnished apartment last August. Utilities are all in my name, but the internet had been in my former roommate’s name. I asked new roommate to put the internet in her name. She was agreeable and shopped around for a provider. I told her I had a router that we could use, but by the time she picked a provider, I was out of the state on vacation. Move in day for her was while I was gone, and in the 4 days until I returned, she had set up the internet and had ended up buying a router instead of asking me where my old one was or paying to rent one from the provider. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, 5 months later, we are finally sorting out utilities, and I get a text from her asking me to pay her $30 for the router she had purchased. I asked her what would happen if/when one of us moved out, would I get my money back or would one person buy the other one out? She then said she will switch to renting a router from the provider, which would cost us an additional $13/mo, and also requested that I pay her $25, or $5/month, for my use of the router from August-Dec. I refused, as it wasn’t making sense, and asked her if we could just talk about it in person instead of over text. But she persisted. She then told me to “forget” that she ever bought the router and to pay her my half of the cost of what the rental fee would have been if we had gotten a rental router starting back in August, which would be $6.50/mo or $32.50 (more than half of what she paid for the router.) I refused again, and told her we should just talk about this in person.

&amp;#x200B;

Please help me wrap my head around this and give me a reality check if needed. She and I have not had any disagreements, and up until now, have had a really laid back relationship (one of us buys toilet paper or soap and the other just buys it the next time sort of thing, even though if we are splitting hairs I have bought the majority of things in bulk from Costco.)  I just need some perspective and help reframing things before we talk again.

Now complete the following example-
input: So I left my mom and dad’s house last night in a big old pissy huff because of an argument that we had on this subject and I’m still angry mainly because I can’t figure out how I feel about this.

I’ve known about my cousin’s wedding for about six months now and my mom and dad went and got my immediate family plane tickets and a place to stay in the town where it’s taking place. I also have been helping to plan and generally get hyped about one of my coworkers’ bachelorette party. We met pretty recently but were really hitting it off as friends and I feel like it has the potential to be a very good friendship. Plus it’s the first bachelorette party I’ve ever ever been invited to and I’m actually super stoked. 

HOWEVER I literally just realized it’s the same weekend as said wedding because I am kind of a poor plan-aheader. I went ahead and told my parents that I may pull out of the wedding festivities and instead send them a nice gift and a message. This is not a cousin who I have spoken with in maybe 5 years save the occasional back and forth on Instagram chat. Of course my mom and sister immediately leapt at my throat, all, “Gee maybe you should uphold the first commitment you made?” I come from a rather passive-aggressive family. 

My dad meanwhile is over here like, If you can manage to get your flight refunded or switched to another trip and then pay me for it I’m cool with it. *But make sure this is really what you want to do.* (ominous dad voice)

IDK, am I the asshole here? I’m 25, don’t feel like I need to be going along with all the things my folks decide I need to do anymore, and sometimes things come up and you just can’t make it. Life is short. Also I have like no female friends and I’m so terrible at making friends. I’m thinking this party, all booze and poor decisions aside, could be exactly what I need in order to stay sane/ not feel so fucking lonely and hopeless. Help? 

**TL;DR:** Just realized my cousin’s wedding falls on the same weekend as a bachelorette party I was just invited to — AITA for wanting to bail on the wedding?

input: Apparently I’m the last person to notice that the Words With Friends game is also a way to hook up (women take note)! I recently downloaded the app out of boredom and got talking to what seemed like a lovely guy. We got on well and swapped numbers, this soon turned into a LOT of flirting, him suggesting we meet, he sent me photos, and we talked every day for about a week. 
He told me was single, he’d been divorced for a year and had no children.
Having recently watched a lot of catfish, I thought I’d just check he was a real person. I put his phone number into Facebook and found his business profile with his photos and full name on it. I wasn’t too bothered and what he’d said so far matched up to this business page, so once I’d seen that I didn’t look any further. 
I noticed one day that he’d blocked my number and sent me a message on words with friends saying that his phone was broken but he could still talk on the game as he has an iPad - red flag!
So I decided to put his full name into Facebook having discovered it on his business page, and found his personal profile, his wife’s and plenty of photos of his new baby! Needless to say I blocked him straight away.
Now this all happened about a month ago, but it’s been playing on my mind because I would hate to be her and not know.

Now complete the following example-
input: My girlfriend and I have been dating for over 2 years, and ever since I went to college the relationship has begun to fall apart. It was really hard at first and I could tell that she was having just as hard of a time as I was. We would both do our best to drive up to see each other, and we would often take turns every other week. However a few months later she made a new friend and ever since then she stopped making an effort to see me, and I could definitely tell I was becoming less of a priority to her. 

She started hanging out with her every single weekend and never decided to come see me. 
Her excuse was that she doesn’t have enough money for gas to come see me, yet it’s only a 30 minute difference of a drive from her friend’s house. We eventually went on vacation during winter break, and we definitely had a lot of fun. But during the night and sometimes during the day she would barely give me any attention and would only talk to her friend over text. I even noticed that she was way more excited in her texting with her than she ever was with me. 

A month later she finally decided to come see me. I was super excited and I finally thought she was still into me. But as soon as she came up she went to my bed and slept the rest of the night and didn’t spend a single second with me. Over my 2 years she would never stay up late with me, but I found out she would often stay up until 2 AM with her friend. 

Just last week her grandfather passed away, and I was doing my best to comfort her over text until I was able to come up for break and do a better job of comforting her in person. Apparently I wasn’t doing a very good job of comforting her though. We didn’t hang out that Friday because she said she would be too sad, but she promised to see me on Saturday for as much time as she could before she had to go to work. 

I woke up on Saturday finally excited to see my girlfriend after 2 months, and I find out she went to breakfast with her friend without telling me instead. I immediately felt horrible and I really felt that I wasn’t a priority anymore. She didn’t get back until 2 and decided to invite me just 3 hours before she had to go to work, meaning I would only get 2 hours to see her. For me, this was the breaking point and I decided to break up with her. An hour after I did this she said she had to see her friend in order to be comforted, and she told me it was ridiculous to break up with her over sometime like this, especially due to the timing of her grandfather’s death. AITA?

As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. 

&amp;#x200B;

   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. 

&amp;#x200B;

   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?
output: ",splitting the Uber costs 50/50 even though there were 3 of us

Now complete the following example-
input: So a bunch of college buddies of mine have a thread where we talk constantly. We’re much older no, but back in the day we all used to be varsity athletes. Obviously we are no longer in that sort of shape but we still talk about girls and things the same way.

While most of the guys in the thread have kinda got on with their lives, there’s one buddy who’s always trying to attack me and a few other “group outsiders” with snarky put downs. He also always talks about girls in a really rough way. Like anytime someone brings up a girl they’re seeing or a social media girl/tinder girl he jumps in there asking for pics, nudes, w/e and then judges the shit out of her making crappy comments.

Soooo a few weeks ago we were all talking and one friend brought up he was thinking about seeing this one tinder girl. Everyone asked for pics. Friend was unsure whether to go on the date cause of the timing and cause he can’t really tell if she’s attractive or not from her pics. I said he had nothing to loose by doing it. Then our more obnoxious friend hops in and asks me if I have eyes cause clearly this girl’s a horse. I respond by asking him if he’s looked in the mirror recently. That devolved into a huge debate where I was called an asshole by the whole friend group for defending a stranger over my buddy. Idk I feel like he needed a wake up slap to let him know he was being a dick but maybe calling him out like that was uncalled for. It was a friendly conversation until I went there. I just don’t like this stuff. Getting made fun of all the time is annoying and we should be at a point in our lives where we’re not just thinking about the physical. I think he needs to grow up. Am I wrong?

Now complete the following example-
input: (TL;DR at bottom) So once a month, my friends and I cook dinner together. There's 6 of us who usually participate. Half of us cook, the other half cleans up. Today, we decide to make hamburgers and fries. One of my friends decided they wanted to eat baked potatoes instead. That's cool, we got plenty of potatoes for her to cook with, no worries. She decides to cook 3 potatoes. She was also one of the ones assigned to help cook, so she and I did most of the cutting of potatoes for fries for the rest of us.

We get our first batch done. We eat a few, make sure they taste alright, no problems, maybe a little more salt. I go help my other friend who's cooking the hamburger meat. I check back every once in a while on the 2nd batch, and notice that friend who wanted baked potatoes is still snacking on the fries. I let it go, because well, they're fries and she helped cut them.

I run to the restroom real quick, come back and she's still snacking on the fries. Then it hits me that, hey, she's got 3 potatoes waiting for her in the oven still, so like wtf? So now I'm keeping an eye on her because a) the fries are for everyone else, and b) she's cooking an alternative meal that equates to the hamburger and fries.

I hint that she's got potatoes waiting for her in the oven, so slow down on the fries. Didn't want to seem too forward about it, but I don't think she took the hint. We got a little down time in between cooking, and she goes back to eat more of the fries. By this time, about a third of the 1st batch is probably gone now, with most of that being her eating them. I decide to confront her and basically said ""Can you stop eating the fries? You've got your baked potatoes and we need to have enough fries for everyone else to eat with their hamburgers."" I walk away because I always feel awkward having to confront people, plus I felt a little guilty for having to do so.

A few minutes later, she walks up to me and says that the baked potatoes are only substituting the hamburger, not the fries, so she's allowed to eat the fries. I didn't say anything back because I felt like I was in the right for calling her out, and also that I thought that reasoning was stupid since she's cooking 3 potatoes. Maybe if it was just 1, but 3?

Anyway, she didn't eat anymore until after everyone got their fries and there was less than a handful left over up for grabs, so I guess my message was understood. But she did disappear for the rest of the time, so I'm pretty sure I upset her and she didn't want to stick around me anymore. We've only exchanged passing glances since, so idk how she's feeling about it. I feel bad since she did help cut them, but on the other hand, I feel like she ate more than enough to compensate for that role. AITA?

Sidenote: another friend didn't like the fries. Flat out said they were undercooked and raw (uneven cooking since some fries were cut larger, but all were definitely cooked enough to be edible; I reckon she's used to conventional fried fries only). Literally convulsed and spat out the fry into the trash and decided to eat cereal instead. Kind of still pissed about that, like bitch why don't you put it in the oven and cook it then? And did you have to be so fucking loud about your displeasement? Ungrateful and disrespectful. Anyway, just wanted that off my chest. Anyone who has cooked for others will understand how I felt. u __ u thankfully, everyone else enjoyed the fries.

TL;DR - friend group makes dinner of hamburger &amp; fries, 1 friend decides to make alternative meal of 3 baked potatoes using same potatoes used for fries. Friend eats 1/3 of 1st batch of fries. I call her out and tell her to stop since they're for everyone else whose eating hamburgers. She says her baked potatoes only substitute the hamburger and should be able to eat fries. I called bullshit, and she doesn't get to eat anymore until everyone else gets to grab their fries first. Friend hasn't talked to me since and disappeared for the rest of the time except to come eat. I feel bad now.

Now complete the following example-
input: So, to give some background I've been with my husband for around 13 years \[high school sweethearts\] and I'm 8 months pregnant with our first child. My BIL and SIL have a 6-month-old \[the first grandchild\] and have been together for 3 years. BIL + SIL moved close to us and his mom still lives where we're all originally from. My MIL has always shown a preference for my SIL ever since her and my BiL got married - which tbh, my SIL is amazing, and a great person. I love her too. MIL and I have a decent relationship overall, and communicate regularly.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, when my SIL was pregnant with niece my MIL was enamored. Everyday asking how SIL was feeling throughout her pregnancy, sending her pregnancy gifts, sending boxes upon boxes of gifts for baby \[which went against SIL wishes, as she told everyone to not buy any gifts until after the baby was born as they do back where she's from, but that's another story.\] My MIL always wanted belly pictures and cried when they first initially told her they were pregnant. I know all this because we share a group chat in a chat app, and have for years. We also saw her reaction to the baby announcement because they taped it - it was honestly very sweet.

&amp;#x200B;

So, husband and I finally get pregnant \[we had some trouble\] and I'm excited to move into this new chapter with MIL  - but that hasn't been the case. When we announced our pregnancy to her, her reaction was ""You waited this long to tell me?"" \[Note: We told her within the same week she was told about my niece - 13 weeks\]. That's the video my partner and I have to look back on. I have received 0 pregnancy gifts, and when she came out to visit us she brought my niece a box of gifts, and brought us 2 onesies - which I tried really hard to be as appreciative as possible for. Throughout the visit, she didn't ask me once how I was feeling, and only asked to touch my belly after my husband asked her multiple times to feel our baby move. \[This was her final day on a weeklong trip\]. I also try to send her weekly updates on his size, and I get a smile emoji back -- god this sounds so petty, but if you see how she responds to pictures of my niece \[in and out of the belly\] there's a clear difference.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, onto the AITA moment -- something I've complained about to my husband is the fact that my MIL has not been really showing any concern with how I'm doing throughout the pregnancy. Last night, she sent me and him a private message asking to make sure that she had the correct date on my BIL and SILs anniversary, which is this weekend, because she was sending them a gift, a gift card to a restaurant, and a card. \[Our anniversary was 2 months ago.. and well, we got nothing\]. After not responding to that for a while she then sent, oh, and -me- how are you feeling?

&amp;#x200B;

I was a bit put off by being what I considered an afterthought, so I didn't respond. My husband came up to me a few hours later and didn't think I had seen it. I explained my PoV, and he was just kind of quiet. After I asked him if he would like me to respond, he said that he understood where I was coming from, but that I had previously complained about her not asking me how I was doing, and that by not responding I was just reinforcing her to not ask me again. He also mentioned that I might be being overly sensitive due to being 8 months along right now and that his mom was/is so much more excited about my niece was because it was the first grandbaby vs second, and it's not a slight against me.

&amp;#x200B;

I was feeling pretty strongly about this last night, but as I see her messages to us go unresponded to I can't help but feel like an ass- she is also the kind of person who will take this as a major slight against her and it will cause problems. AITA, or being too petty? Or can I claim this as my hill to die on?

Now complete the following example-
input: I haven't had any traumatic experiences with alcohol or anything, and this idea wasn't brainwashed into me by anyone. But I've just come to accept it as part of my personal philosophy and I don't want to give it up. 

Essentially, I'm almost 21 and have never had alcohol, ever (never even been to a party, that's the kind of person I am). I never want to. I don't care if times get tough, I would prefer to resort to healthier coping mechanisms, thanks. I also certainly don't need it to have fun. And it smells bad. I have no need nor want to drink.

Since my 21st is coming up in a few months, my boyfriend who is a couple years older than me keeps saying that he will get me some nice champagne for my birthday and he keeps talking about it like he will expect me to have some. I don't want to, and I keep telling him that, but since my birthday isn't super soon neither of us sound very serious about it either way. 

He drinks a normal amount, which I'm fine with, I just don't want to drink, even on my birthday. I am worried that my boyfriend and any other people who may remember my birthday will keep pressuring me to drink, and if I don't, they will think I am lame/annoying/straightedge/an asshole. 

WIBTA if I don't drink, even a little, on my 21st birthday, or drink really ever? Part of me feels like with our current culture I will be seen as the asshole because I may be seen as holier-than-thou person who won't just chill and have a good time, or possibly fit in with others (I don't know anyone who doesn't drink AT ALL). That part of me says I should just suck it up and drink for one day. But the other part of me doesn't want to budge.

input: I just moved to an awesome little ski town with my SO. I went remote at my current marketing job to do so. It's a pretty high stress position. I have to work late almost every weekday, 9-10 hours.

She has a good bit of money saved from her summer job and is currently working very little, and enjoying it.

She often complains that I work too much and hates that I have to schedule plans for us around my job. Today she was especially aggressive about it and I blew up at her, said she was only making a stressful job fucking worse every damn day.

She wants me to quit and work for the mountain (a decent pay drop). Says I should pursue my happiness or whatever.  Thing is, I'm not sitting on a pile of cash like her. Plus she never hesitates to let me buy her shit, complains when I don't, and complains when I ask the same of her. I've got nice shit I want to buy for myself too, and this job helps me do that!

But, idk, I yelled at her quite a bit today about making my life hell because she's moderately inconvenienced. I may be jealous she has the freedom to work just a little and shop around for a job she really loves, but, fuck, I'm working so hard so I can do that for me too.

input: I’ve been with my girlfriend for almost a year and I love her to death from earth the the endless sky above, but while talking with her on the phone she mentioned her manager, at the restaurants she works at, she said her manager showed her what Ecstasy looks like, it was her first time seeing what it looks like and her manager said she was gonna go home and try it with her boyfriend and let her know if she should try it. My girlfriend is sweet and innocent and jokes around a lot but she seemed serious to me about highly considering taking this if her manager told her too, she is overly nice which isn’t always bad but she tends to be easily influenced  by people she trust or have known for a while. She was even persuaded to eat a weed cupcake by one of our friends, when months before we said we would never eat anything with weed in it or smoke weed at all. It’s happened before where people have taken advantage of her kindness and it’s happen to me as well so I don’t wanna see anything bad happen to her at all, while on the phone I said in our convo;

Me: I’m sorry but I can’t stay if you decide to take drugs, I won’t come back either cause that’s not something that’s good for either of us at all

Her: it’ll be fine as long as I’m in a controlled environment and with people I trust, like you.

Me: Nope, can’t do it, im sorry I love you and all but I can’t stay and won’t come back if you decide to use drugs I just can’t, that’s not something I want for us

After that she went silent for a bit but only until her mom came to pick her up from work, I didn’t really think much about my response until she texted me before going to bed, which made me feel like an ass

“Hey, don't threaten to leave me again. That hurts. I understand if you don't want me to do something but don't threaten to leave an never come back. Please.”

I don’t know if me text response was any good either cause I decided to say this

“Sorry....I just don't want anything to do with drugs at all, no weed or anything like that, I'm sorry but I'm serious, if your on drugs like that I'm not gonna be able to trust it, I just want you far away from it cause that kind of shit can kill people, I don't want you to die just cause your manager said try it, I know it's an asshole thing to say but I can't stay if you gonna let people influence you that easily....I love you to death and I don't wanna have to break up with you over drugs cause that's just dumb, and that's why I didn't eat the weed brownie or muffin or whatever either, cause it can cause addiction just as easy as one time, I don't want that for you either, that's also why when I vape I keep you away from the smoke and try not to hit your face and say to move to the other side of me, I don't want to hurt you with that or see you get hurt all because you were just told to take a drug because it would feel good....I'm sorry but I'm being hurtfully real, if you take drugs I'm not staying”

input: This happened around two years ago, but I just discovered this subreddit and I had an interesting argument with some roommates back in the day that I think is appropriate for discussion.

&amp;#x200B;

I (male) used to live with three women, one of which was my girlfriend, in a small three bedroom apartment. We got along really well for most of the time that we were living with one another except for this one specific incident that still bothers me to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a viral video of a 4 year old russian girl ""fluently"" speaking seven languages. Here is the link to the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa0vQh3uSdw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa0vQh3uSdw)

&amp;#x200B;

We were all watching this video in the living room on the TV, and after watching the video, I said something along the lines of ""That's pretty cool, but there's no way that little girl fluently speaks seven languages.""

My roommates challenged my logic by saying ""Some people are just smarter than you, just because you couldn't speak seven languages when you were four doesn't mean she can't!"" 

This struck me as a kind of troll-y comment, because I in no way insinuated that I was more intelligent than this 4 year old girl-- rather; that it was very unlikely she was truly proficient in seven languages. They called me a total asshole for even remotely doubting this little Russian girl's language skills and made me feel like crap for having any doubts as to the video or the girl's legitimacy. 

It became such a heated discussion that there was actual tension in the air, and ultimately I apologized to them because it seemed to really make them upset. To this day I am impressed by the girl speaking 7 clear sentences on live TV and nailing it but (and maybe I'm wrong here) there's no freaking way that ANY four year old proficiently and fluently speaks ANY languages above a basic toddler level. 

AITA here lol?

Now complete the following example-
input: Backstory information: my husband is military, we’ve known I’d be moving sometime in the future for a year now, and we’ve known it was overseas for over six months now. 

I was talking with my sister about how excited I am to finally be leaving soon, and she stated that she was under the impression I’d want to have a going away party before I leave. I don’t. 

I could see myself wanting to have a dinner with my parents, siblings, and grandparents. I have a few friends that I’ll hang out with sometime before I go. And I’ll make it over to my in-laws house too. 

The people that seem to be upset that I’m leaving are the people that I see at family parties once or twice a year, and the friends I haven’t seen since leaving school. I don’t see the point in having a party where I’ll see people I don’t see in my everyday life, or even often in my life at all. It feels superficial and weird to me. 

When I told my sister this, she gave me a look that made it seem like I was being irrational and then gave me an, “okay, if that’s how you feel.” 

My husband said something about how I should make my rounds to say goodbye to people too, and there are people that I will do this with, but I don’t see the need to have a going away party to invite a bunch of people who I already live my life without seeing, or honestly of making it a big deal of leaving at all.

Is this one of those things where you’re supposed to just suck it up and do for the people around you? Am I the asshole here for not wanting to?

Now complete the following example-
input: This just happened.  My brother and I live together.  Almost everything we split 50/50.  Our place has two refrigerators, one in the kitchen (the main one) and another in the basement.  I'm trying very hard to lose weight and the best way that works for me is to not see any sugary junk food around, otherwise it haunts my mind.  So, I moved all my food into the basement fridge and informed my brother about this.  I tell him the main fridge is all his and that I have a goal to stop opening or looking inside of it.  He typically has ice cream, pudding, donuts, and similar stuff in there.  The basement fridge is slightly more inconvenient.  Ownership of the fridges are also split 50/50, so he seemed cool with that. 

Yesterday, I cooked whole wheat spaghetti that's been sitting around forever.  I told my brother he's free to eat some.  Afterwards, I finish cleaning up and I put the leftovers into the basement fridge.

The next day, I open the basement fridge and see the spaghetti is missing.  I ask him if it's in the main fridge.  He says it is.  I ask, ""Could you take it out for me?""  He says no.  I'm flustered by this but I ask again politely, ""Please, bro.  I'm trying to take the fridge thing seriously.""  Reluctantly, he gets up and goes to the main fridge.  He's giving me shit and calling me childish the entire time.  Im waiting around the corner because I dont want to see inside the main fridge.  He opens it and holds the door.  ""Take it,"" he says with his arms up and eyes wide like I'm crazy.  I explain that I don't want to even look inside, but I suspect he's trying to test my resolve or something.

He refuses to take it out and I just explode at the top of my lungs, ""TAKE IT OUT!!""  I was actually a bit shocked about how loud I was.  I'm usually quiet and reserved for years at a time.  Anyway, he takes the spaghetti out, gives it to me, and then flips out on me saying I'm crazy and childish and that he doesn't give a fuck about my goal.  We argued so hard that I felt lightheaded and he said he might throw up.  It was intense.

I seek wisdom.

 AITA?

I want to add that we both have plans to move out on our own in the very near future, and we are usually not in each other's way about things.

I just don't like talking to her when she's drunk now, she used to get a little bit verbally abusive while she was drunk but we had a talk and she's a lot better about that. I still don't feel like talking to her though because I know I'll become an emotional babysitter and she won't remember the conversation.

Now complete the following example-
input: Backstory: She and I have been together for just over 3 years. We both graduated college 1.5 years ago. We both wanted to get out of this town immediately after graduating, but she had an opportunity to further her education just after graduation. We decided to stay for the extra year and a half, with the agreement that we would leave as soon as she finished school. 


It’s finally just about time for her to graduate. I’ve been working a low-paying, dead-end “college” job for the past 3 years. I finally got a job offer in our dream city, and am incredibly excited to start. Perfect, right? Well, she’s just finishing up clinicals, and has been assisting a neurologist for the past 2 weeks. She and the neurologist apparently work well together, and he offered her a position at his surgery. 

This is the field she wants to work in, and is now very conflicted. On one hand, she wants to move with me. On the other, while I have a job set up there, she doesn’t. She keeps suggesting that I should move first while she works here and gains experience. However, in the medical field, you generally don’t get hired for less than a year. I really don’t want us to have to live 8 hours apart for the next 1+ years, especially since we are supposed to be starting our lives together. Additionally, I have really bad experiences from a past long-distance relationship, and absolutely do not want to go through that again. 


Her mother also keeps encouraging her to take the job and do long-distance. She’s a military wife, and has spent years apart from her husband at a time. She keeps telling my fiancée that “it’s no big deal,” even though, for me, it is. 


My question is, AITA for being adamant that we don’t make our relationship long-distance?

Now complete the following example-
input: Ok, so I'm brazilian and this is important for two reasons:
1) Our families are larger and everybody is much more dependent on one another comparing to northern countries - people here usually stay at their parents' houses until they can fully support themselves or get married, and lots of families (such as mine) remain at their hometowns until death or something special like a job offer happens. Therefore, it's unlikely that I can just ignore this issue as I'll probably be pressured to meet them in a near future.
2) The recent presidential election really divided the nation in people who support Bolsonaro and people who strongly oppose him, like me. It was no surprise to anyone that my uncle would vote for him: he's always had extremely racist, homophobic and misogynistic opinions, and had no shame on sharing them even before Bolsonaro made it ""OK"". 
The thing is during the campaign things got really intense so I decided to cut bonds with him, even writing a message to my family stating I could no longer regard as my relative someone who supports the execution or exclusion of 80% of the people I hang out with. At the time most of my family supported my decision, since everyone was very nervous about the possibility of the now president winning. However, now that things have settled down and with a new baby on the family, everyone is surrounding him with love, something I just don't feel comfortable on doing no matter how much I respect and applaud his decision of adopting a child with his wife. I wish all the best for their family but I have no intentions on meeting them right now, as I would have no idea what face I'd keep or what I'd say to someone who  is absolutely the opposite of me. I am sure that my mom will say that I'm an asshole if I tell her all of this when eventually my time comes to go there, so I need to check others' opinions first. So Reddit, am I the asshole here? Also, Am I an asshole for sincerely feeling sorry for this kid's likely education, even though he is much better with a supporting family?

tl;dr: I cut bonds with my racist, homophobe uncle and have no intentions on meeting him just because he now has a child. AITA?

input: okay so under just normal circumstances YTA would be a straight forward no-brainer, but hear me out.

(we live in a dorm, at uni,  in close enough proximity to each other to be able to see each other)

&amp;#x200B;

so I don't usually sleep a lot (I go to bed late and get up early), but I was extra tired so I went to bed at about 9:00 P.M.  It didn't take me long to fall asleep even though my roommate was playing on his console. Anyways, he constantly keeps waking me up: turning lights on and off, yelling at people in chat, and slamming shit when he gets pissed he dies. I'm sleeping intermittently, and he finally decides it time to go to sleep somewhere around 12-12:30 A.M. he's super loud and wakes me up as he's getting ready for bed/doing random shit (if I purposefully kept him up bc of this tho...major YTA. because usually I'm not in the room at this time and normally awake if i am).

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm awake

&amp;#x200B;

I mostly just lay in my bed trying to go back to sleep as he passes out, and can't. so i get bored around 1:30 and start fucking around on reddit, and eventually see a post that reminds me of the dc aquaman movie that i still hadn't seen at about 3 A.M.  So i decide to watch aquaman, and look over at my desk to get my earbuds.

&amp;#x200B;

but my earbuds aren't there.........

&amp;#x200B;

I must have left them in my car. My roommate is dead asleep by this point, and he usually doesn't wake up super easy. so i figure playing it out loud is fine as long as it's quiet enough that it doesn't wake him up. I don't see him move at all, and didn't figure he woke up. So 5 A.M. rolls around and his alarm goes off. He gets up, gets ready for PT, and makes a rude comment about me watching a movie since 3. 

&amp;#x200B;

The comment didn't really bother me because iv'e told him plenty of times to tell me if I'm doing anything that's getting on his nerves/keeping him from doing shit he needs to do. mostly I'm just confused as to why he didn't tell me to shut the hell up when I woke him up instead of waiting 3 hours.

input: This all happened just now and I'm really confused.

Today we got both got off class a little earlier as usual, so we went home together. When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.

Fast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.

Am I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.

Now complete the following example-
input: I'll get this out of the way, I feel like an incredible asshole here, but maybe it's one of those things where she's overreacting a bit. I honestly don't know and maybe it doesn't matter because we have to move on one way or another. 


So backstory on this, fiancé grew up in smallish mountain town north of Albuquerque, NM as did her parents and both sets of grandparents. Both grandparents got engaged in the town plaza because it was sort of the thing to do back in the day. Her parents also got engaged in the plaza but in a much more informal ""hippieish"" manner in the 70s, but it was still the same location. 


When we seriously started talking about marriage she told me flat out (to paraphrase) ""I don't care about the ring, I don't care about you asking my dad for 'permission', I don't care how much you spend, what time of year it is or if it's freezing outside; I want you to propose in the Taos Plaza."" I was like cool...I can do that. 


So we've been talking about rings for maybe the last six months and I finally bought one that I feel definitely fit her personality. I stupidly told her best friend and best friend told her. So last weekend we decided to spend the weekend in her hometown skiing. As the weekend came to a close I could tell she was getting antsier and antsier but it honestly didn't clue in what the deal was. As we drove past the plaza on the way back to Albuquerque she even said ""he look, it's the plaza...we should stop!""


Because I'm an IDIOT it didn't clue me in what she was talking about and I was the good computer engineer and said something like ""no, no we have a schedule to keep, work tomorrow!"" So the whole way home she was that kind of like mad/sad and wasn't really talking to me. I figured she was tired and didn't make much of it. 


So next day I saw her best friend at work (she works with me) and she basically said that I really blew it because girlfriend was expecting me to propose on the trip. In an a-ha moment I was like that's what she was mad. So I took her out to a nice dinner Tuesday night and got on one knee and proposed to her in a restaurant. She said yes  but I could tell she was still really upset. I asked her what was wrong and she very openly told me (again paraphrasing) ""I love you and want to marry you, but for almost a year and half I've told you I want one thing and one thing only from my proposal and it's goin to take me a long time to not be upset that you didn't listen to me."" 


So the moment that was supposed to symbolize the start of our new life together ended with her taking most of her food home in a doggy bag, leaving to her apartment by herself and her telling me ""I really love you, but I'm really upset and I need some time before I see you again"" and kissing me on the cheek. I know she'll come around but I don't know when. 


So I full on acknowledge I'm an idiot, but am I an asshole?

input: My 16-years-old brother goes to school by a motorbike and it has been broken from last saturday, suddenly, it worked again on sunday early morning but i still told him to go fix it. He had the whole sunday yesterday( i got some places to be then so i told him to find a garage to fix it). I'm sure i gave him enough money to replace any part of his bike, it was even enough to replace half that bike but when he got home by sunday noon :
Me: -yo, how is your bike now?
He: -I'm not sure, it wasn't fixed
Me: -what, what wasn't fixed? 
He: -mmmm, i went, i went but they said it may have just a futile problem and as you see, it still works, i rode it the whole morning
Me: - rode where? 
He: -mmmm, i was hanging out with friends
Me:- yeah, cool, you stupid ass, what did i tell you, it's broken meaning it's broken and cannot fix itself, you can ride it now but it can be broken back at any time. Again, i'm telling you, go right this afternoon and fix it anyway or don't you dare ask my help when it is broken back. 
He:- ok
Then he was outside till i went to bed and go to school today morning, i didn't know if his bike was fixed and today he just texted me: 
-help me, the bike is broken again 
Me: - what, wasn't it fixed?
He: - actually, no, i......
Me: - shut the hell up, you didn't listen to me, go fuck your self.
He: - i know, but it's raining right now and i didn't bring a raincoat, come get me home i promise i'll go fix it later
Me: -fuck no, i don't care you stupid ass.
 So i let him walk his bike home a 6km way or if he's not stupid that much he can stop by a garage somewhere but i guess not, i don't even bring a raincoat just because he didn't see a raindrop in the morning. 
If you wonder, in my country, 16years old kids are still at 10th grade and they go to school 6 days a week, 4 hours a day so my brother leaves school at 11am, he hasn't got home yet.

input: So I just got a new job in a different city and I’m about to leave for who knows how long. I told my friend and he insisted we go to lunch. We had already been tried to go to lunch twice this month but he would also fall through and it wouldn’t happen. So today he said he could go but he forgot had to do an audit at his job and it would be later than normal lunch time. He suggested Saturday and I agreed but then he insisted we go today. 

Cut to now and he just canceled today, then wanted to change it to beers and tonight. I told him I couldn’t because I’m on a pretty strict diet right now and more importantly he’s canceled so much that I just don’t trust him keeping these plans. Needless to say he blew up and wants to make me feel guilty for not wanting to go later. He also called me like 6 times in the  last hour to which I didn’t answer cause I’ve made myself clear. 

Now am I the Asshole for putting my foot down? I know this sounds like a shit post but I do feel bad for not doing it but at this point I’m fed up.

Now complete the following example-
input: Started a new job about a month ago. Good job, but it's the kind where mistake are very easy to make. My trainer and I are basically splitting the duties of a single role, we each take half, with her watching and always available to help. 

Anyways, today a found a case that had several errors on it. A page was missing I had look up, some of the information was filed incorrectly, etc. easy stuff to mess up. But it was a lot, so I needed her help to sort it out. At one point during the review of it, she makes a comment that clearly indicates she thinks I did it. Now, that is a fair assumption, they are easy mistake to make, i made them, and I'm new. Her tone wasn't accusatory, she wasn't going to report the error or anything, no one is getting it trouble. The thing is *this time* it's on her. Her name and employee number is all over the case. Would I have been this asshole if I had advised her this was all on her?

Bonus info: she is pregnant and in pain from preexisting medical issue exacerbated by the pregnancy. She is always kind and understanding with me, but I get the feeling she can be a bitch. Also, her and our boss worked together for almost a decade at this and another firm. So it may not be wise to call her out even if I'm not the asshole...

Now complete the following example-
input: So earlier today I went to a coffee shop and the parking spaces are very tight there. It didnt help that there was a car that was parked too far out (who was preventing multiple customers in the lot to move around) that was making it extra tight. Anyways when I left due to the fact that the car was making it difficult I had my friend step outside to guide me and make sure I didnt hit the car behind me. She does this thing were she literally stands inbetween any potential car I might hit and we make sure I don’t hit any cars otherwise I’d hit her (I know very dangerous but we’ve been doing this for awhile and im extremely careful NOT to hit her) Anyways I was getting a bit too close and she bangs on my car for me to stop so I obviously stop immediently, by then I’ve had enough room to pull out safely so she hops in the car and we get ready to leave before a man interrupts us, here is the dialogue:

So you’re just gonna drive away and pretend you didn’t hit that car? 

My friend very confused and says “She didn’t hit that car I swear it, I was literally standing in between the cars if you heard or saw her hit it she hit my leg.”

He insists that I most definitely hit the car and I step out of my car because at this point i’m very flustered thinking I hit the car. A third person in my car a part of my party assured me I did not hit the car but the man was insistent that I did.

He begins threatening to take a picture of my license plate (which he did) as my friend explains to him and tries to assure him I most definitely didn’t hit the car. I asked my friend “Are you sure I didn’t hit the car?” And then looked to him and said “Sir are you sure I hit the car” and he looked over to her and said “If you’re not gonna be honest about it I can just let the person inside know what she did.” I am not a confrontational person at all and this really made me anxious but my friend began getting very frustrated as he was accusing her of being a liar. We said if we hit the car we had no problem letting the owner know (We really had no problem with that) but he went inside the restaurant. I reflected in the middle of the lot what to do if I should go inside and explain myself to him. But I am so sure I DID NOT HIT THE CAR. My friend is SURE 100% I didn’t hit the car. A man we were friendly with in the coffee place came out as he was curious to the situation and I explained it, he said “I would just leave, you didn’t hit the car.” We stayed in the parking lot for a good 10 minutes to see if the guy who confronted us may come out with a person. My friends all agreed that we should just go so I drove away. But I felt really bad and wrong for this... That man was really convinced I hit the car and I felt like I was a criminal for just leaving ... He has my plate number and I’m afraid if there is a scratch on that car (even if its not from me) I might be blamed for it. I understand he was just trying to be a good citizen and I commend him for that but it really bugged me that he refused to reason with us and accused my friend of lying. It’s just been bugging me all day. AITA for just leaving?

In my culture, we really aren't allowed to date (middle eastern). All of our marriages are basically arranged (what I mean by this is me and the girl both have to agree, so it is consensual). I'm going through college right now and so is she. 

Me and her have some disagreements about some things, some things that I really will not get into. I'm also getting nervous. I feel like a few months ago I was in HS, now I am about to get married and leave my home. 

I don't know why. I guess I never appreciated living at home. I still feel like a kid. Everything is already booked and cannot be cancelled. Prior parties which costed a good amount of money. Wedding invitations to HUNDREDS of people are already made. 

I agreed to it. They asked me if I was ready and they found a girl and yeah. She's going to be pissed more than I can put into words if I say nevermind. My parents will be angry beyond words, so will her parents.

Now complete the following example-
input: so for context: my girlfriend and i have been together for over a year now and we have a very good relationship (despite being ldr), open communication, very clear boundaries and just supporting each other well - i am very happy in this relationship. my girlfriend is quite religious and not really an overtly sexual person, we have a comfortable sexual contact but havent been physical so far (which means we sext) because she wants to wait til marriage, which i respect completly

but this morning i wake up to texts from her sending me a screenshot of a convo she had with some dude that asked her to sell pictures of herself in a bathing suit, talking abt his porn addiction and what not inbetween and she seemed like? relatively receptive to it until he asked for straight up nudes where she got creeped out and blocked him...

her comment on those screenshots was like ""haha lol i almost sold pics to this guy until he got creepy"" where i am just at a loss of words bc  


1) i think he was creepy before asking for nudes i mean that guy asked on advise on his porn/hentai addiction before going on before how beautiful and hot and what not she is

2) where is the difference between selling bathing suit pics and nudes in terms of creepiness, i mean its obvious what the guy wouldve done with those images...

3) the fact that she even entertained the thought of selling suggestive pictures of herself is very ??? to me, i feel upset and hurt  


now i do not condemn sex work or selling nudes of urself or whatever at all, i think its a persons free decision and they may do as they like

however i think the persons partner should absolutely be ok with and aware of everything happening in this department - my girlfriend and i NEVER talked about this before, and we talk a lot about sexual boundaries, so i was really not at all considering something like this to even ever coming up since my gf is very conservative when it comes to sex

i messaged her and told her that i am upset and hurt, especially because she once told me she doesnt agree/gets upset when i call someone else than her ""hot"" in passing (and in more of a ""oh this person looks attractive objectively"" and not ""i am attracted to them"" way) which i stopped doing after that despite thinking it wasnt really an issue - but since it made my gf feel bad/upset i respected it, so i assumed the same would go for her  


i am definetly going to talk to her about this issue further, i doubt that we wont be able to resolve it but i really need some input from a neutral source on this topic: do i have the right to be upset over my gf considering to sell suggestive pictures without my ""consent""? shes her own person and if we werent together i would have no issue with this, or even if she wouldve discussed doing this with me before i would probably react differently. AITA for being upset at her for this?

Now complete the following example-
input: Me (14) and my mom had a fight today. The problem about this is that my mom insists on being right all the time. She will argue her point to no end even if she knows she’s wrong. So today we were doing scripture study for about 45 minutes and my brother complained about how long it took. My mom said that it wasn’t that long and that “We started at 10:30” I chimed in and corrected her saying that we actually started at 10. She flipped out at me because “I wasn’t supporting her” I told her that she was right and that I shouldn’t have said that because I knew that’s the only way it wouldn’t cause a fight. Then she just keeps attacking me about it. I replied a few times and also tried to stop the fight a few more times. Eventually I got tired of it and told her that it wasn’t a big deal and she gets offended about everything. This has proven itself to be true over the past few months. She recently didn’t like the way my dad replied to someone he was talking to. She tried to correct him and he “Ok” in a bit of an exasperated voice. She went crazy telling him how rude he was and that his tone was mean. She’s done this multiple times recently. So after I say that she get offended by everything and she says she doesn’t, she talks to my dad and eventually they get to a point where she is upset that he was on his phone checking emails during scripture study and she tells him “It really hurts my feelings when ur on ur phone” I thought this was funny cuz she just said she wasn’t offended by everything. She came back into my room multiple times after to tell me about what a bad person I am even thought I’ve been patient with her for the past couple months. 

So, am I the asshole?

My husband and I have been together for 4 years married for 8 months. We recently separated a few months ago and are living in seperated homes. We're working on it, been going to marriage counseling. He brings up, plus has mentioned it in the past that he feels like previous men in my life have had better sexual experiences (threesomes) with me and I've given them ""more"" than I give him. I explain to him that under certain circumstances I would be comfortable with random person, one night stand situation. Not anybody we know personally. I really love him and just wouldn't feel comfortable doing that with him! I don't really want to share my husband with anybody... I feel like we're committed to each other and that's something I did with less committed individuals. I'm not entirely shutting it down either, I just haven't encountered a situation that I would be down with. Apparently this really bothers him. AITA? Is he the asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: I’m 19 years old going on 20 in a few months. I still live with my parents because I attend community college in my hometown. I’ll be transferring and going to college a couple of hours away in the fall. 

I’ve started going to therapy after I asked my parents if they would let me go (aka let me use their insurance and be okay with me going) to help me with my anxiety. I have social anxiety disorder as well as some generalized anxiety. I’ve struggled with my mental health for what I think has been pretty much my whole life, or at least as long as I can remember, but within the last couple of years I’ve become way more cognizant of it and it’s been bothering me a lot more and interfering with my daily/weekly life. So I asked to go. 

My mom went with me to my first appointment. I told her it was fine if she came with me to see the office or meet the psychologist at the end of my appointment but that she wouldn’t be able to sit in with me because that’s not allowed (and also I didn’t really want to her to, but I didn’t tell her that. I didn’t want to hurt her feelings). She tried to sit in my appointment anyway and my psychologist very nicely said she couldn’t basically and that she would talk to her at the end of the session. 

I learned that my mom told my psychologist stuff at the end of the session that just blatantly isn’t true and isn’t really relevant to treating my anxiety. I know she was just trying to help and is just worried about me as a mother, but it frustrated me. I told her I could go to therapy by myself from now on, which I was planning on doing anyway since I’m 19 years old. 

I went to another appointment recently and she tried to ask me details about it as soon as I got home. I wasn’t really in the mood for talking about it so I told her that sometimes I wasn’t going to tell her all the details about every appointment; that I was 19 and therapy is a personal thing, that it’s not like going to the doctor for the flu. She said that she had ‘been on this journey with me’ with I fully realize since she’s my mother and I don’t plan to leave her in the dark. But then she said that she pays for it, insinuating that since she pays for it I should tell her all that goes on, which really bothered me since I don’t think that entitles her to knowing intimate details about my sessions. Then she asked if I didn’t want to tell her because I was talking about her in therapy. I said no, because I’m not. I’m doing CBT, not talk therapy. Also even if I were, I don’t have much bad to say about my family. 

I felt bad about what I said earlier so I told her that it wasn’t that I didn’t want to talk to her about it, it was that I didn’t have much to say, which was partially true. Then I saw she had read the little stack of papers my therapist had given me without asking me, which annoyed me a little bit. I didn’t say anything but the principle of that is wrong imo. 

Then today I came home earlier than usual from college because I had stuff at home I needed to get done and she asked me why I hadn’t gone to a club meeting I usually go to. I told her why and she started berating me about not going and telling me that ‘it’s hard to feel sorry for me’. Basically saying it’s hard to feel sorry for me about my anxiety when I don’t go places like that. But I usually do. 

That hurt my feelings and so I said that she can’t expect me to go into intimate details about my mental health when she says stuff like that, and that I don’t have to tell her anything especially when she says stuff like that. She stopped me from saying anything else. 

Am I the asshole? 

TDLR: I’ve started going to therapy for anxiety disorders. Mom wants me to tell her lots of details about sessions and mental health but isn’t very compassionate or knowledgeable about it and I responded.

input: My dad always unplugs the router at 10pm and takes it with him to his bed, so I connected another router in my bedroom without his knowledge, which I turn on when he takes it.

He says the reason he takes it is because my little brother will play games all night if it’s left on.

My router has a different ID and password which my brother doesn’t know, so he can’t access it.

My dad also doesn’t pay for any extra for bandwidth at certain times or anything.

I like to do coursework late because I have bad insomnia so I’d rather just do something productive or play games.

input: Anonymous for the voiceless (Google them) were doing one of their protests in my city recently, and since I had time to kill before my train arrived I stopped to investigate.

One of the protestors struck up a conversation with me, and for the most part she seemed pretty chill. She talked about how we exploit farm animals, I talked about the food chain and human evolution, yadda yadda... and eventually I agreed that humans could live solely on plants if we wanted to, and that it would be better for both our health and the environment if we did.

She then asked me ""So why aren't you vegan?"" and I responded with ""Because I don't want my friends and family to see me as a self-righteous snob.""

Unsurprisingly she was quite offended, so I told her all about the things PETA do, about about all the times I've been called 'murderer' for eating meat, about the sort of things that vegans have a reputation for (you all know what I'm talking about) and I also told her the story of that bride who wanted a vegan-only wedding which made the rounds on Reddit not long ago. My explaining failed to un-offend her, so I said that I would consider being vegan if veganism ever fixed its public image, and went to catch my train.

This was last weekend and I still feel like I was a bit too blunt with my answer... Am I the asshole?

Now complete the following example-
input: This happened yesterday and I'm kind of conflicted over it. For some context, I am currently in the process of transferring to a different college. I've been in the process since the beginning of the semester but only just left my roomates know this past Thursday. We're pretty friendly but we aren't that close so I didnt really want to discuss it until I was sure I was leaving, hence why I waited so long. 

Separately I had been annoyed with this particular roomate, we'll call her M, since she has a habit of leaving piles of unwashed dishes in the sink for days at a time and expected me to wash them for her, so I had been avoiding her a bit to begin with. 

This past weekend I went out of state and on my way back yesterday afternoon I received a series panicked texts/messages from a family member, N, saying she was ""worried about me and wanted to know if I was okay"" emotionally. I was confused by this since it seemed to come pretty out of nowhere, I have struggled with depression in the past but I've been pretty open about that as well as about the fact that I'd been doing very well recently. 

Apparently N received a series of messages from M on facebook, that I have screenshots of, telling her that I was a suicide risk and was isolating myself and not talking to anyone and asking her to keep watch over me since switching schools seemed like ""another way"" for me to isolate myself. She also said that I had been ""displaying a lot of red flags"" and ""got angry whenever she tried to bring it up"" (which in my memory she never has?), as well as not talking to B, our other roomate. N has a panic disorder and so when she received these messages and then couldn't immediately get ahold of me (as I was out of town), she had a panic attack.

When I got home I had all of the roomates, theres only 4 of us including myself and B and we were all already aware of the situation, come to the common room and sit down to talk about it. I asked her why she said those things about me, and her reasoning came down to ""you weren't talking to me"". I told her that she crossed a major line by going to my family first and telling lies about me, and that she had no right to assume things about my personal life and act like they were true. She started to say that she would do differently in the future but I cut her off and asked her to please in the future keep it to herself because she clearly doesn't have a very good grasp on my state of mind. I thanked her for her concern but told her that, I feel like I'm unable to trust her with details about my personal life and apologized in advance if I was more distant going forward. When I said this she started crying, and I left the room.

I understand that M likely had good intentions with this but I was furious that she didn't talk to me, or even to B, who I actually am friends with, about it first. The fact that she ""tattled"" on me to a family member who she doesnt know crossed a major personal boundary in my eyes. Especially since I had a really bad experiance with this type of thing when an ex-friend of mine in high school tried to get me committed by making false reports about me. M knew about this, and so I feel like she should have known the degree of paranoia that it would give me for this to have been handled like this. 

I feel like I handled things as politely as I could have but I feel really bad about making her cry, AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: Last week I purchased a Volcano on ebay for $300. For those of you that dont know, the Volcano is a vaporizer that is used for the ole devils lettuce. Its a tank of a unit thats known for  for its sturdiness and basically lasting forever. The unit was described as used which I figured was fine - maybe some scuffs or some residue but whatever. The listing also described and pictured a traveling case. Cool.

 I get it a week later and the case has a hole in the back the size of a quarter. My friend points out that you could fit the plug through so you can just keep it in the case the whole time when using it. It made sense and then I didnt care so much.

Then i go to plug it up and see the grounding prong is missing on the power cable, but theres still a hole im the cable as if one had been there before. I contacted the manufacturer of the vape with the serial number and confirm that its a 2011 unit and should, in fact, have a ground prong.The Volcano uses up 100 - 111 watts of electricity when its on. Neither of these defects were pictured (although the hole in the case I dont care so much about). 

I take pictures and open up a refund request on ebay. The seller offered me a $20 refund because it was ""fully operational"" (he is correct, it does turn on and function) and he ""only sold it cause he was in a motorcycle accident and needed money."" 

 
I rejected the refund and want to pursue a full refund through ebay if necessary but kind of feel bad too. I know it functions, but but the cable just sketches me out, as well as the fact that he imtentiomally chose not to picture either thing. WIBTA?

input: Two years ago, my grandfather passed away. I was working in marketing departmen at this  small branch office of a huge company that sold soil fertilizers at the time. I could not attend the funeral since it was what we call busy month. But I promised my upset Dad that I would take a week off and visit grandpa's grave the following month. 

My general manager was a tiny man with some bad tempers so I submitted my leave request when he was in a good mood. But he refused my 7 days off request and trimmed it to 4 days only. (Take it or leave it he said). I tried talking to the human resources about it since my grandpa was buried in a remote village and it would take me 48 hours to get there by bus from the nearest airport. But my manager would not approve it. 
So I flew back home and found out there had been a fight in my family concerning the inheritance which included a house and acres of land. I needed to stay there until the problem was solved. So I called the company's human resources to ask if it's possible to get more days off at least until I was not needed to sign some papers regarding grandpa's inheritance.

The company told me it was not possible. There were only 2 options left for me. To fly back to work or to quit the job. I chose the latter since I loved my family and wanted to set things right among us. 
But apparently the company acquired me to go through a one month notice procedure before my last day. This was not written down on the contract though. If I didn't do it, then they would not give me my last salary, bonuses and others included. This upset me since I had worked my ass off for them taking long hours into the night. And as far as this resignation procedure went at the company, nobody else had ever been forced to go through the one month procedure before. It was as if they were trying to get me in trouble or something. But since I did not want to complicate the matter because I was still focusing on my family problem as well, I opted to let it go, though still bitter about it. It was a lot of money to let go after all. 

A few weeks later, one of the company's clients contacted me (not knowing I had quit) regarding some products that had arrived in bad conditions, broken and dented.  The truth is, in a rush to sell them the company did not bother at all to check which products were still in good condition to send.
Because they needed to replace all the old ones left in the store room ASAP, which was one of the reasons why my manager wanted me to come back soon in the first place. 
The manager was well aware of it but one of my colleagues had told me he had overheard him saying 'The shipment is to blame. Just get rid of those craps'.

In a rush of vengeance, I told the client about it. I've heard the manager has been suspended and the client has sued him and the company for it. Now that my family's problem has subsided, I feel a little pang of guilt for getting him in trouble though. AITA here?

Now complete the following example-
input: Me and my friend play a few days every week, *on top* of both days on the weekends. Today, I asked if he could play. No response, fine. I message again 2 hours later. He says no. Fine. I message again an hour later. Again, no. Ok. I ask another hour later, and he flips out. I'm mad at him for being so pissed at the fact that I asked twice in 2 hours, and that hes saying hes stopping it before it ""becomes a thing"". He's mad that I asked. AITA for being mad at him for this?

input: So this was this new year, and some context, I’m Male and 16, and she’s the same age, now, we were both at a mutual friend house, and we used to know each other but hadn’t seen each other in 3 years or so.

So we’re both there with her younger brother, and our friend and her younger brother, so later into the night we get drunk, and end up making out, but then at about 5 in the morning we end up spooning and I won’t go in to detail, but I fingered her (sorry for the crude language) now, I want to make it clear now, that while we were both a bit drunk she was clearly consenting, and was keeping my hand down there if I tried to pull away. So this happens, we go to sleep.

Next morning, everything’s good, we kiss a little bit more, but then that afternoon once I’m on the car in the way home, I try and text her and she reads it and doesn’t respond, so I leave it and try again later.

Eventually I get a message back saying that she was fine in the morning, but then as she remembered more she felt more embarrassed, and then said she didn’t want to talk to me anymore, so I left her alone 

Am I the asshole? I feel terrible about it still, and don’t know if I did something wrong

input: In the grocery store earlier I watched a man move an empty box off of the shelf to get what he needed and then throw it on the ground. I waited until he rounded the corner and picked it back up to put on the shelf. I looked up and apparently he had come back to that aisle for something and we made eye contact before he turned away and left. My husband said it was a dick move on my part and I should have just “let him make his mistakes” and made sure he was gone before picking it up. He looked pretty embarrassed and it’s possible he was coming back to pick the box up. AITA?

One of them constantly ignores me when I'm talking, so keeping a straight conversation is pretty much impossible. He also always talks about how many girls he knows and how he touches them (I wish I was kidding tbh).

The other one is super childish and always does stupid shit. He steals from me (sometimes even breaks the stolen item and the returns it to me saying that it's not a big deal), is constantly screaming and trying to embarass me in front of girls.

At this point, I'm just tired of being constantly ignored and made fun of in some way.

Now complete the following example-
input: Burner account cause friends know my main account 

Background, I'm currently a junior in high school, friend is a senior. We were real close friends for 3 years. This happened a couple of months ago, but a recent argument with someone else brought it up again and I've always been worried I was in the wrong. Now I have the tool of this sub. 

So me and her had an argument a few months back to which she blocked me for a petty reason (I already got judgement from others on that). A month goes by and I finally find I'm unblocked, ask her if she's still mad, and she says no. After this though, I have to initiate every single interaction, from talking to texting to spending time together (which she always declined). She didn't even say hello in the halls. Only on 2 occasions does she show any effort, once the day after I texted her where she came over and sat with me for the final 10 mins of a study hall we share and the week before Christmas break. 

She asked to spend time with me on the coming Saturday but I had to decline as we had plans with family from out of town and would be gone the whole day. So over the first few days of break she occasionally sends me memes when we're not having a conversation, and those we do have I initiated. 

Fast forward to the day after Christmas and she blows up on me (all through texting mind you) for never talking to her, never spending time with her, etc despite me always asking and texting nearly every other day. When I call her out on this, she responds with ""well you could say hi once in a while"" which rather confused me. 

Once we both calmed down after more arguing, I tell her that if she's not going to put in any effort then neither will I. She reads this and blocks me and it remains that way now. I've made no attempt to fix it this time. 

Which I why I come here. As I said, recent conversations brought this up again and I've had some people tell me to get into contact somehow and others say not to and I'm at a loss. I'm worried I didn't do the right thing, and am seeking more mature judgement. So, AITA for not trying to fix it this time? 

TL;DR friend gets mad at me for “not giving them enough attention” despite me initiating anything we do, blocks me when called out and given a choice 

I apologize for any formatting, grammar or spelling errors. I'm on mobile and its a bit late where I live.

Now complete the following example-
input: So let me start off by stating I'm not looking to start a witch hunt, so I'm trying to give as less personal info and stuff as possible while still giving enough information to understand the situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago there was a kickstarter I really wanted to support because the thing in question was something I could see becoming a really great product, and the person behind it was someone I had always respected. The problem was that kickstarter requires credit card, which most people in my country don't have anymore because it's seen as pretty outdated. So I talked to the person behind it and asked if we could back it in any other way. After a few times and several ways of trying to get in touch they publicaly stated that they would start accepting paypal donations  as well. Since I trusted them, I agreed and donated through paypal(May 27, 2018). The person clearly stated several times that they wanted us to donated and e-mail them PERSONALLY (This becomes important later) with our transaction info and other things required for the kickstarter. After a month or so, I had still hadn't gotten a reply, so I e-mailed again because I thought ""well, they might have missed it who knows"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I waited, and waited, and waited. I popped in on some of their online livestreams to ask about it and the answers was pretty much the same everytime: ""Yeah I read you e-mail this morning you will get a reply very soon"". So in november I went to reddit to look for answers. (And yes I realise this is enough info for people to know exactly who I'm talking about but that's not import here) There I found a thread, with several people who had the exact same issue. Months had passed and no one had gotten a single reply on anything. Now obviously this was a public complaint, so surprise surprise we got a reply. Sort of. ""Yo I'm sorry but e-mail me and cc x person we'll sort it out."" So I did. No reply, and the CC adress was a fake one as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

On february 10th, 2019, I e-mailed once more. I asked for info about my payment, but I also mentioned that they would be  starting a 2nd kickstarter for the same thing soon, and I felt like I should warn people if I kept getting no reply. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got a reply to this one. Within literally 30 minutes. And that's what left an extremely sour taste in my mouth. The moment publicaly talking about this is mentioned, they're suddenly able to reply? It might have been fine if they just gave info about my payment, but instead I got a very hostile reply. They basically said I shouldn't complain, that they weren't able to do customer supportfor 2500 people personally(Which was BS because they literally asked for it), and cancel my order. I replied stating once more that I didn't want to put them in a bad light, but I needed some pressure to have them reply, I was sorry that was my mistake, but okay. I haven't heard from them since and my money is still gone. Am I in the wrong here?

Now complete the following example-
input: New here so if I haven’t understood one of the rules please let me know!

I have a tricky situation I’m going through as of late.  I’m in a long term relationship.  We aren’t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We’ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She’s 19. 

My “stepdaughter” and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn’t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  

After that I’ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I’m still kind when I’m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  

I thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I’ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fiancé loves having her here, but I’ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fiancé and I.   

I really feel like I’ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it’s time to push her out of the nest.  I’m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don’t really care how she takes it.   My fiancé will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it’s for the best.

input: Forgive my mobile usage:

Now don’t get me wrong I’m white(half Mexican but very white passing) as well but I’d  say I’m more educated than my mom on race my sister is black and she tells me her struggle as a black individual and how she goes about her life.

My mom joined a group called “the witches layer” (or something like that) on Facebook and was going about until she saw a post(posted by an Asian lady) saying that she’s “quite simply tired of getting asked what race she is” 

This resulted in many white people saying that 
“They are sorry” and many other PoC people saying how they know the experience.

My mom commented that “all white people are not racist and doesn’t see why all the white people are apologizing for something they didn’t do” 
This resulted in the leader saying that “even though they don’t need to apologize it shows the community that most white people know and you as a white woman should be educated which you are!”
 
Then my mom for no reason stated “I’m not white, I’m half Native American/Irish and my ex boyfriend is Mexican as well as my now husband and one daughter is black” 

This sent the leader into a angry state commenting “I feel your using PoC people as a token to get your way in these discussions, I know that you can talk about whatever you want but this conversation is more for people with this type of struggle”

Then she was blocked. 

She told me expecting me to be on her side that 
“She has a right to go into this discussion because she was hit on for her race all the time”

I told her flat out “that you kind of are using me, my sister, and step dad as a token to get your way as a white individual into these conversations so you can trash PoC people and ‘school’ them”

She went ballistic and said she wasn’t white and that she has as much of a struggle as a ‘native American/Irish’ person in the community I told her again “mom you’re white passing so am I” 

She then texted us this: [text message](https://imgur.com/gallery/nlYe3xY)

So reddit! AITA? 

TL;DR my mom got angry because leader of group said she was using ‘black people as tokens’ and I ultimately agreed on that.

input: So I've known my buddy P the best part of 10 years . I watched him turn from a teenage apprentice to a head chef to business owner and back to sous chef after losing it all through stupid mistakes (drugs) hes now 26 this year , lives in a shithole home with his parents and 4 younger brothers (nothing wrong with the structure or the parents they just never clean up after themselves) he met a girl about 6 months ago and they are officially in a relationship. Hes changed (obviously) so now I don't see him as much and when I do it with his gf .. again not a problem she's actually quite nice.  Just in that 21 year old ""let's party"" frame of mind constantly .. anyway... 

The last 3 or 4 times I saw him he was asking me a lot of questions about kids (having had my own son at 26 under very different circumstances eg my own place in a relationship for 6 years etc etc ) so I out right asked him if his gf was pregnant he said ""no but we are going to start trying soon"" 

I told him straight ""You aren't ready for a child , you need your own space, you are in massive debt, you have only been with your gf 6 months you still have so much to learn about each other, you work like 100 hour weeks, how are you going to do that with a baby keeping you up all night "" he told me I don't know what I'm talking about  and if I can do it at 26 so can he. 

I've had to bail him out 3 times in his life due to him jumping the gun to early and I feel like hes using the thought of a baby to distract him from his current problems 

I'm just trying to protect him but I know he took it the wrong way and didn't really get where I was coming from. 

So reddit.. am I the asshole? Should I apologise ? Should I let him make his own mistakes or should I come at it from a different angle ?

Now complete the following example-
input: As the title states, I stopped mid-sex due to something my girlfriend said. Without going into a heap of information I’ll give you guys a little context. We’ve been arguing recently, and the main basis of that is that my girlfriend has a few selfish and entitled tendencies, we’re both women and have been together for eight years now.

A small example of this is when I was working in the office the other day and ended up having to counsel a very good friend of mine through a life crisis that was urgent for about an hour and as a result I didn’t get any work done. Partner enters just after I get off the phone and expresses her annoyance that I’d put time into my friend instead of her, and now was going to have to spend extra time making up for it finishing my work. This is a rarity that I bring work home, I spend a *lot* of time with my partner, it was just a situation that came up. Quite obviously this is bullshit and I told her so. But this is the type of low level crap that I’m having to deal with recently. My friend genuinely needed me, it wasn’t trivial.

So anyway, back to the asshole moment. We’re enjoying a bit of time together (last night) and I’m in the act of giving her oral, I’d been doing it for about fifteen minutes at this point and moved onto kissing her in other places before communicating that I wanted her to change position so I could do something a little different to her. No hurry to orgasm, I just wanted to shake it up a little. Her response?

“Well I was happy with you just playing with me to be honest”

Now this in itself isn’t an issue, and usually I’d be like “no probs” and go to town down there. But it was the tone. The tone was the same one she used in the office, slightly petulant, a little whiny and entitled. I stopped what I was doing and told her I’d lost the horn, which I had. I was also very annoyed and couldn’t quite put my finger on it at the time (no pun intended). 

So now I’m the person who gave her partner blue balls because she had the audacity to tell me she was enjoying something I was doing and wanted it to continue, but with a tone that would make you want to send her to her room because she sounded like a bratty kid.

AMITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: This happened 3 weeks ago, but I barely talked to the teacher today because of several reasons: 1) My brother hesitated on telling me because he was told he could get it back that same Friday. 2) I can only go Mondays and Wednesdays. 3) She was absent last Monday I went. And 4) We had spring break.
So my middle-schooler brother was wearing a black ""Subscribe to PewDiePie"" hoodie he had just bought a week prior. The hoodie was out of dress code for the color and the logo. He insisted on taking it to school because other kids wore all kinds of stuff and they didn't get in trouble. I know that just because other people do it, it doesn't make it right.
Anyway, this teacher saw him in the hallway and asked him to give it over. He did. Well, this lady left the hoodie on a cubby by the door. Mind you, when I went today, I had to wait about 10 minutes in her classroom because she was out and about somewhere. Obviously, she is careless about what goes on in her classroom.
When she finally decided to come back, I presented myself and reminded her of my brother and the hoodie. I then asked her what she's going to do about the situation. She told me ""I told him to look in the lost and found."" *Turns to my brother* ""DiD yOu LoOk In ThE lOsT aNd FoUnD?""
That's when she made me mad. Like okay ogre-looking-ass, you really expect a middle schooler who stole a hoodie to return the hoodie to the lost and found?
My brother then tells her that he looked multiple times and she looks at me with a ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ look. I then say, Thank you, I'm going to take it to (insert principal's name). *I *personally *know *the *principal, *although *she *might *not *remember *me *because *she *was *an *administrator *at ""my *high *school *a *few *years *ago.
I go down to the office, and ask if I can speak to (insert principal's name) for an issue with a teacher. They tell me I have to speak to administration first, and I need to get a written note from my parents to do so since I'm not the legal guardian.
I guess I have to mention now that my dad works past the time the school closes and my mom is recovering from a surgery which she had 2 weeks ago. That's why I am doing all of this.
Anyway, AITAH for expecting the teacher to pay for what she took and lost? The hoodie was only $20 because my brother had it made. It's not like it's a big deal for her or I to get it made again. I just think it's unfair for my brother. If this was a cellphone we're talking about, and she lost it, I think it would be just as big of a deal. Why couldn't she just tell him to put it in his locker or bag or just carry it. It's her fault it's lost, so she should be responsible for paying for it.

Now complete the following example-
input: Some background - 17 year old guy, biological parents divorced when I was at least 5 and I went to live with my mom. In court it was determined that my biological father (will refer to him as biodad, reasons later) would be the one to pay alimony if anyone was going to, but my mom, being the kind person she is, decided to let it slide. I would see him every once in a while but I lived with mom.
Fast forward to 6 or 7 years ago when I was 11 or so, my mom remarries to my stepdad (whom I refer to as dad, hence confusion with titles) and we move in with him and his two children. His wife/their mom passed away many years before. From here on out the visits with biodad become even fewer and further between, essentially being holidays and 3-day weekends.
Another fast forward to this past year or so. My dad and I have agreed (with mom's consent) that my relationship with biodad has zero benefit to our family, and that we should slowly start reducing the number of times I see him. He has tried to poison my beliefs with his, which are essentially that HE agreed not to pay HER alimony, and that HE was the one that made sure they separated peacefully. All not true, obviously. And also, he decided to smoke weed in front of me on several occasions and every time we would go visit it was at his convenience and so he would have to do as little work as possible, and when I was there he was working so I was chilling at his (my grandparents, his parents', I should add) house. If I'm gonna chill I can chill at my house. He lives 2 and a half hours away in Delaware.
We start cutting him out pretty well and make some good excuses, and he buys it for the most part. This goes on for a bit until the beginning of December. What he does before a holiday is essentially pester the fuck out of me with texts like ""Hey got any dates for our visit yet?"" Or ""Hey do you know when you can come down?"" And it got to the point where I was sick of it.
My parents and I carefully crafted a response that used legitimate excuses (stretching them a bit) to say ""I can't come to you, but maybe you can come here and we can go out to dinner"" and he doesn't buy it.
15 or so minutes later I get a response - ""I don't think so. Maybe next year. Merry Christmas."" Then - ""Don't bother responding that's bullshit and you know it"" and ""take care"" and my parents and I are just kinda meh about it. Another 15 min and I get two more: ""btw lose my number"" and ""asshole"".
Then he texted my dad. He essentially said ""hey I don't think I can trust [mans_best_comrade] tonight can you keep an eye on him? We were arguing and I just laid him out"" which was so manipulative I had to laugh.
They called the next day and my dad essentially listened to him scream about what an ungrateful, condescending asshole I am. That's all that was.
So here we are, and he hasn't said a word to me since the ""asshole"" text. However, I've been using his Netflix account for years since he offered it to me, and I just thought about the fact that he probably doesn't know I'm using it without his permission. Is this a dick move or is it alright given the circumstances? (Keep in mind I'm fairly certain I'm NTA with the texting situation, I'm asking about the Netflix deal) 
Really sorry it's so long it's just a lot of background!!! Thank you!!
TL;DR toxic Biological father called bullshit on excuse to not see him, is now pretending I don't exist to teach me a lesson, but I'm using his Netflix without him knowing.

Now complete the following example-
input: I’ll try to keep it brief. I’ve played video games my whole life, and playing them with friends is the best way I consider to experience them.

I’ve had a friend group since leaving HS of about 8 people, and we play Smash very frequently, which is probably my best game as I’ve sunk many hours into it.

To be realistic, no one in this group is at my skill level, and this results in maybe one game in a few hours going to one of my other friends while I’m playing.

During play, I try to push the wins off as either luck or downplay the win entirely. I don’t try to be cocky, and look towards what my friends do right when they play me instead of what they do wrong.

Recently, my friends have been getting more frustrated when playing me, making snide comments about why I’m allowed to play, and even an extreme situation of feeling unsafe at the anger one of my best friends in that group has shown when losing certain matchups.

I can understand that it’s frustrating to lose, but when I’ve tried to sandbag in the past, it either doesn’t work or I get called out for it. I’m getting really bitter about the situation that I might consider not playing smash with them when the time comes.

I’ve recently tried to think about it from their point of view, that maybe me downplaying my wins might make me look like I’m bragging. AITA?

He asked to me to do the favor of hiding these items or  do whatever i want with them. Because apparently the cops know about him stealing these items and they’re most likely doing some investigation. I asked him several times to tell me what happened, he replied by saying the less you know the better and said that he’ll tell me the full story tomorrow. I told him that im not gonna do him the favor unless he tells me what exactly is going on in detail right at that moment. He insisted that he can’t tell me right now. I asked why ask me for the favor and not someone else, he said he does not have anyone else. So i said no and he took a train back home. Which means he spent money to go to my house, and go back (expensive train) to get nothing out of it. Now i do feel bad, because he has done me a lot of favors but i just had to sit this one out.

Now complete the following example-
input: Recently, I(17M) have moved out of my dad's to go to my mom's. This all happened after multiple arguments with my dad during us moving into a new house. This culminated into a big argument where my dad threatened to beat me if I didn't get out of his way when I was trying to get him to calm down as my stepmom came into the house drunk. Add to it having to hear my stepmom ask for me to drive her away from everything, I felt like I was going to break.

So, I decided then I was going to go to my mom's. My dad was very upset. He constantly told me about how he tried his best to raise me and he's sorry I don't like him, but I don't dislike him. He's my dad and I love him. Still, he's continued in texts saying that I have changed and to be careful of who I trust. My mom says it's just him being a narcissist, but what if he's right?

Now complete the following example-
input: My boyfriend and I, both in our mid 20s are together for four years. There has been an issue with a female co worker of his for over two years. He hang out at her house in secret 1.5 yrs ago, I found out much later. He claims nothing happens. They still work together and text sometimes, but less frequent. He swears he won't hang out with her - she has send inappropriate texts and such.

We live together in our own house. I leave every monday morning to another city and come back tuesday morning for work issues. This means he is alone for 24 hours.

This tuesday morning 10am I got out of the bus and saw that girl walking to the bus. We live in a small craphole place, with nothing to do. We have a supermarket, a bakery, one tiny clothing store and that is it. This girl lives in another city, works in another city and studies in another city. I know she has NO friends or family in our town, because she mentioned it earlier to my boyfriend. (""You are the only one I know that wants to live in that crap place!"")

What was her reason to be there, so early in the morning? I came home and my boyfriend was in bed asleep, with the window and curtains open. He always sleeps with the window and curtains closed. Also his jacket lay on the floor near the door. We live together for 4 months and his jacket never laid on the floor before.

I confronted and he said she was not there and has never been to our house. Then I decided to check his internet history. Yes, fellow redditors, I know this is wrong but I do NOT want a rant about this - I know how much Redditors want to burn alive people who do this. I checked it. It was a mistake. I know. Please no rant about how bad it is or how my relationship is doomed already.

So I saw that the evening before he watched some netflix on his tablet until 11PM. After that, things get weird. He watched youtube on his mobile from 11.00 to 11.19 PM. This is odd, because I am with this guy for 4 years and he NEVER watches youtube on his phone when he is inside the house. He always only does this when he is in the bus, outside or whatever. However no busses drove at that moment so that can't be true. After 23.19 there was no signs of activity anymore on his phone, tablet or computer.

He set up an alarm clock at 22.59 PM. 

The first next activity was next day 08.04 am when he put off his alarm clock, and then 08.30 on Whatsapp.

He has a car that he shares with his mom. Wednesday we got into the car and he said; Mom keeps asking bout the car and drives my fuel till its empty. And I said; no she didn't asked for the car for at least 2 weeks why you bring this up? He just said oh it bothers me.

He kept bringing up this girl a couple of times. ""I don't think it was her, I think you saw it wrong. Probably can't be her"" blah blah. 

He got angry and sad when I asked him if he cheated and he denied all and called me paranoid.

So, fellow Redditors. What do you think? Am I the asshole for accusing him of cheating?

AITA

First off obligatory, I'm a lurker on Reddit, not really a poster so I hope I'm following all the rules.

Second, I got the nerve to write this after seeing all the posts lamenting posts seeking validation on here.

This story likely has two assholes me (27), him (29) but maybe it's just me, where I'm mostly concerned and wondering if I am, in fact, the asshole is with the very last step: Where I cut my friend off and stopped trying. I'll tell it as simply as I can.

This summer I fell into a very deep depression after a bad breakup, which led to a quickly deteriorating relationship with my parents (they liked her more than me and me more when I was with her), and this put a huge strain on me and my job suffered. I hadn't had a roommate in the better part of a decade but I was doing so poorly on my own that I knew I was only looking for one more excuse to commit suicide. Depression has been a part of my life since I was 12 but I'd always been able to cope, up until this summer. I was high most days/nights and developed an issue with painkillers and alcohol. My friend of about 6 months had quickly become one of my best friends and always found an excuse to ask me to move in with him long before all this went down - his motivation was self-admitted as saving on rent money and the fact that this was his first time living alone and didn't like it, also friendship. Me (introvert), him (extrovert).

I took him up on the offer one day, explained to him my reason why was that I was afraid to be alone and my lease was up in 3 months anyway. His landlord didn't give a rip about leases and signing papers (another conversation for another day) and that meant everyone was fine with me living there for as long as I needed/wanted. Where things get complicated is with my buddies arrangement he said clearly I would owe no rent on the months I was still paying my old rent. I'd cover all the utilities for those months and generally, he'd just be a good dude. For my old apartment, I was still on the hook for 3 months rent, unless someone started a new lease with them. It would be a per diem kind of thing...1,000/m is $33/day so if someone took over on the 15th of the last month, that would be $500 back to me. Someone did take over on the 23rd of the second month ($231 back to me). I paid rent full rent to my friend on the 3rd month. I did not give him the $231 as I probably should have, reason being was my suffering career which was 100% commission (tag [r/choosingbeggers](https://www.reddit.com/r/choosingbeggers)) and I did cover all the utilities for the first two months, we went 50/50 on everything after that.

Two months go by. I'm stoned and drunk most nights, I'm making just enough money to pay my bills, eat ramen, and go to therapy for the first time. Never been this kind of broke. I'm not at all better and wouldn't be for several months. My priest, friend, and trusty counsel-giver suggests education and seminary. Says he doesn't care if I become a religious or not and suggests I use this as a way to get a free education, find a new lease on life, and pursue a living that actually means something to me. After a month of deliberation, I took him up on it. I actually get excited again, like really excited, like watched a sunrise and smiled while sipping coffee kind of excited.

I tell my roommate, and first words out of his mouth is ""moocher"" he immediately says I won't make it and shouldn't do it. I was shocked. I explained that I was open to the religious life but also not expecting it and the diocese knew that, they were just willing to take a chance on me and so I would take a chance on them. I explained that if this didn't work out, the education would still afford me a better, more fulfilling life than I had been living before and I saw this as a way out of my depression and into better living. At this point, he demanded the full second month's rent, which I did not pay and was already 2 months ago, and began wanting rent on a weekly basis. I did pay the rent weekly but told him no on the second months rent as that was already long since spent and couldn't do back payments like that.

Every single day he tells me I won't make it in school. Every day I tell him I don't care, I'm trying. I begin to cut him out as just one more negative voice in my head.

Some time goes by, he wants all new tires for his truck. He was going to trade labor to the guy for about a quarter of the cost. Me, being the genius that I am just got a new credit card with an introductory $150 bonus if I spent $500 or more in three months, my 400 IQ continues to kick in and I tell him to put it on my card and I'll give him $50 of it. $840 goes onto the credit card. He pays back $400. I go to school. He gives me two post-dated checks for the remaining $480 spread out over one month. I had no problem with this.

He cancels both checks a week after I leave and says he'll Venmo me the money when he's ready. I text him once a week for two months, he always says he'll send it next week or next pay period. After 8 weeks of this I give up. This whole time he's been making about 3X as much as me with similar bills. I apply the $150 to the bill and donate plasma to pay off the rest. 18 credits and 15hrs/week of service work, an actual job wasn't practical, wise, or actually allowed.

He continues to text me periodically, condescending remarks like ""making lots of friends?"" ""Did you remember your lunch?"". If this doesn't sound condescending, just trust that I know his humor.

Even when the texts got nicer, I stopped responding and the friendship is over with me feeling like he stuck me with a credit card debt I had no good way of repaying and a whole lot of negative feedback from a friend who was supposed to have my back.

TL;DR: Friend helped me out with a place to stay as I recovered from depression. Education was offered to me as a means to a new lease on life and I accepted the offer. The friend gave me daily negative feedback on my decision to the point that I had already begun to shut him out before leaving. He left me with credit card debt and negativity and so I cut him out.

I'm a digital and traditional artist and in one of my classes we create t shirts and things (socks, lanyards, water bottles, stickers, you name it). I'm a big fan of putting my art on t shirts so I can sell them.

M wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

Now complete the following example-
input: Info: I’m a 22yr old college student trying to earn money for books, food, and some occasional fun. I tried working a regular job only to have my grades fall. 

So I’ve been driving Lyft for a few months, and it didn’t take me very long to notice that MOST people don’t tip after their ride. No matter how great the ride is (I usually have pretty good convo, and I offer amenities like a charger and usually give the riders a chance to pick the music for the ride), most people just ride and move on with their day. I receive a tip 10-20% of the time according to my ride history. Although it makes me angry, I’ve pretty much gotten used to it. 

Here’s the thing- tips make the difference between earning decent money (15-20 an hour) and earning less than minimum wage on some days. It gets really shitty sometimes, especially since Lyft/Uber drivers have to use their own gas (don’t get paid) to travel to the pickup location. This may not seem like much, but with gas prices going back up, it really adds up over time and eats into the already terrible pay. 

I understand that I can get another job, but since I have class during the day and really don’t want to sacrifice my studies, I pretty much have no other option. The freedom that ride-sharing gives you to work whenever you want is a real benefit. 

***So to try to boost my earnings,I grabbed an envelope and wrote “Tips for gas and rides that didn’t suck” on it and hung it in my car. Although when I have it up, I usually do get more tips than normal, I kind of feel like an asshole for possibly pressuring people into giving me a tip. Sometimes I can tell it makes people uncomfortable. ***

TBH I have a problem with the fact that most people will tip their waiter but not their driver. I feel like giving someone a ride is much more personal than serving at a restaurant, as it requires more personal conversation, and you literally have their life in your hands while they’re in the car. I feel a good quality ride + good conversation + a few extra amenities is equivalent to a waiter giving you good service in a restaurant (what else can you possibly do during a short ride to campus or to the store). Maybe because people don’t know how little I get paid? The app makes it really easy to tip, but since people don’t see that screen until after they get out the car, it’s a lot easier for them to stiff drivers on the tip because they don’t have to do it in front of other people and will probably never see that driver again.

Am I pressuring/manipulating people? If so, how can I encourage tipping without being asshole if I’m already doing my best to provide a good service. 

TLDR: I drive Lyft and the overwhelming majority of riders don’t tip, so I put a “tip jar” up to help encourage/remind people. 
output: ","putting a ""tip jar"" up when I drive Lyft"

input: My mom is going on a trip tomorrow.

She had a row with my stepfather just last night.

Stepfather is kind of a control freak and because they aren’t speaking, he tells me to weasel out information about my mother’s trip including the name and contact of her friends, the tour guide, where she is staying etc. 

He didn’t say it out loud but his tone clearly screams ‘Do this using any means necessary’ 

I think he wants me to break into my mom’s phone.

I know that him having this information will make my mom feel unhappy and betrayed.

I just think it’s an invasion of privacy and unfair for him to use me like this. I feel dirty.

Finally he gets fired because he's burnt out. Since then he's been rotating between shitty jobs and unemployment. The other day I told him that he should really consider becoming a teacher for the tenth time, and he replies that he has an interview for being a sales associate. I tell him that being a teacher has got to be better than what he's been doing for the last 15 years and would provide some stability and an opportunity for a decent salary. He replies it's not what he wants  to do and I say ""at this point it's not about what you want to do, it's about not losing your house"" he called me an asshole, but I don't see a better path forward for him. He says all the jobs he should qualify for don't call him back, and he doesn't want to search for a job that he would have to move for. I don't know what he is expecting to happen, but meanwhile he is going nowhere.

Now complete the following example-
input: Throaway cause, why not? My wife and I have been married for a couple years. It's just us so theres no kids or anything like that involved in our day to day life. We dated for a couple years before we got married and I think were pretty ok overall. 

However, my wife likes to make unhealthy decisions.
Now, I'm not the healthiest of guys. I'm not a glistening, washboard abs, ripped as heck guy, but I like to think I healthy. I can run a 5k pretty easily, I can do any hike in our area, I go the gym, I drink atleast 2 liters of water a day M-F etc etc.
And although I'm not as in shape as I'd like to, I try to be. Try, keyword.

My wife however, doesnt really seem like it. She seems unhappy with her health overall. I love my wife. And I care about. And in the past I've gently nudged her into the idea of being healthier.  Joining a gym, drinking more water(which she does do now according to her), doing yoga, eating less processed food etc. However her behaviors overall seem to stay the same. She complains of aches and pains, she has trouble sleeping sometimes, she complains of her weight and not being confident sometimes.

Like I said, I've tried gently nudging her, but now sometimes it slips out into critiques. I now tell her, you shouldn't do/eat/try/drink that, you should X this. Sometimes I feel like I'm losing my patience and sympathy.
Sometimes it leads to arguments.  

I love my wife, I really do. I push the importance of being healthy or trying in our 20s ,so itll pay dividends when were older but she doesnt seem to care. I dont need her to be a super model or an athlete.  I just want her happy and healthy.  I think the two are important and theres a balance you need to have. I try to be healthier myself but it doesnt seem like she does. I dont wanna see my wife suffering from illness related to this in our future.

So,AITA for critiquing my wife and maybe coming  off as critical now over her health choices? Should I mind my own bussiness? 
output: ",being critical of wife
