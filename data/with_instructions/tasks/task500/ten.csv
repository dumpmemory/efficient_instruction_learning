input: My boyfriend (well just call him M) and I are creators on Instagram (he is also on TikTok). I'm a digital and traditional artist and in one of my classes we create t shirts and things (socks, lanyards, water bottles, stickers, you name it). I'm a big fan of putting my art on t shirts so I can sell them.

M wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. 

M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying ""of course you dont know, because you never look.""

input: Im making a throwaway account because i don't want anyone to know this and this has had a really big emotional toll on me so please be respectful in the comments. I want to know who's in the wrong but please be respectful when doing so. So i've been dating my girlfriend for a few months now and i really felt like she was the one for me. I thought we were getting married. I remember when we were dating she used to talk about how wedgies were funny and she would give me them a lot. I did it to her a couple times back and i felt it was weird she seemed to enjoy them. She would even ask me to give her them too which was even weirder. Wedgies are supposed to be a prank, they hurt and are embarrassing, definitely not enjoyable to receive one. She was giving me wedgies every time we hung out and it was getting really really annoying and i'd tell her to stop. She'd calm for a bit but then revert to it. Eventually we're hanging out and she leaves to go the bathroom. I go on her computer to look up flight tickets or something and i see a closed tab of a youtube compilation of guys getting wedgies. There was also one of guys getting wedgies on google images and thats when i realized that wedgies are some sort of weird fetish. This whole time i felt i've been violated. SHe'd only did it a couple times in public in front of my close friends or hers so it wasn't that big of a deal but now knowing she gets sexual pleasure out of it I feel like she also cheated on me when she gave my guy friends wedgies too. I told her i figured out what is going on and that her wedgie fetish is disgusting and degerneate and i can't be with someone who gets turned on by that. She starts crying and she's on her knees begging me to not leave her and give her another chance and to find a way to work things out. I leave and everyday i get missed calls and texts which I've been ignoring. I'm considering maybe giving her a second chance but idk. AITA here? all my friends think so and her friends have been harassing me nonstop, i had to block them all on social media. Should i give me gf another chance or did she violate me? I really feel if the gender roles were swapped I would be considered the asshole

Now complete the following example-
input: So I often drink a couple of beers after work to wind down (not every day, but it’s a normal thing for me). Tonight I was watching tv and my son asked if he could try some. I held the bottle and let him have a small sip. I thought he might spit it out but he just kind of made a small face and that was it. 

My wife was right there when it happened and she gets this horrified look on her face. I say “he just had a small sip”. She said nothing and ends up putting our son down to bed and proceeds to let me have it in a the weird hushed/scream voice she uses when she’s upset but wants to be quiet. 

She said she thought for sure I would tell him no when he asked and she can’t believe I gave him alcohol. I explained why I didn’t think it was a big deal but she’s still pretty angry. I guess I’ve always been more easygoing when it comes to parenting...

Anyway I’m just wondering if what I did sounds so terrible to the average person. I mean, it’s not like I let him chug the whole bottle! I figured he was just curious about the taste, and now he knows. Literally one sip and that was it. (Although if you ask my wife she’ll say he had a “gulp” of it). 

So was I the asshole in this situation? (Using a throwaway because I post in other parenting subs on my main, and I don’t want any judginess spilling over).

Now complete the following example-
input: So my friend and I have been super close for like five years now, but living together for only a year.  In that one year though I've grown to not like his behavior.

We run with a very tight knit group that all know who the type of person he is, and when you don't see him as much, is a great guy.  But he's had a history of changing how he acts based on friends we have hanging around us.  When he's around those people he begins to insult me and my other roommate, who's also a close friend of ours.

We've told him before how we don't appreciate him insulting us, especially when he doesn't do that to his other friends.  His response was just that he didn't mean it to be rude, he just thought since we were close he could.  Even though we don't ""joke"" back.

But there was a part where he crossed a line for me.

I work with kids, so naturally he thinks it's funny to call me a pedophile.  Not only to other friends, one who also works with me, but his online friends (he games)  that I've never met.  I tell him to not do that, and he persists.

I'm also very close to someone with a kid.  And one night I was playing with the child, in front of the friend.  The child wanted to play foot doctor and asked me to take off my shoe and sock.  I thought I was cute so I recorded the interaction and put it on a social media story.

He then puts me in a group chat with a friend of ours, and then goes on ask me why I have videos of little girls playing with my feet.  And saying that he thought it was creepy.  He knows that girl and my relation to the mother and that's where I drew the line.

I told him to go fuck himself and have yet to talk to him again.  I've let other people know that I'm currently not on good terms with him and they have essentially said ""that's just how he jokes"" and made me out to be the bad guy for being stuck up and sensitive about it.

I don't think it's personally funny, especially when it's the child of a very good friend of mine.

AITA?

Now complete the following example-
input: My daughter is 9 and just started going to a new school in January because we moved. It is a public school in an urban city which is quite multicultural. She is half-Chinese and half-white. Although she is part Chinese, not many people can notice. Some have thought that she is Italian or Greek or even Irish for some reason.

Anyways, a month and a bit ago, my daughter came home a bit sad. I asked her what was wrong and she told me that in school, everyone shared what they did for the weekend. My daughter said that her family is Chinese so they celebrated Chinese New Year. The teacher (who is white) apparently told her “But you’re not Chinese. You shouldn’t lie.” My daughter said she felt embarassed in front of the whole class.

I was amused but also angry. I phoned her teacher and VERY CASUALLY told her that my daughter felt hurt by her being dismissive of her heritage. Her teacher was strangely defensive and asked me if I was accusing her of something. I said no and just that she should try being more open minded. 

A few days after this incident, my daughter said she felt like the teacher was treating her unfairly, namely refusing to let her go to the water fountain during class, giving her a “time out” for not lining up in time for recess, putting her on the spot to answer a question and berating her when she had the wrong answer. This time both my husband and I booked an appt to talk with the teacher, who was quite dismissive of us and very unhelpful. 

At this point it was affecting my daughter’s enjoyment of school. She would cry at night and beg me to send her back to her old school. Finally I had a talk with the principal, who told me that other parents have been accusing the teacher of racism in the past and said they’re trying to work with her. In the meantime my daughter was transferred to another class which worked out great.

Flash forward to last week when I was picking up my daughter from school. Her old teacher approached me and we made a bit of small talk, then she said casually, “Well Im not going to return to teach next year so I guess I can thank you.”

I was super taken aback. I told her I did NOT mean for her to lose her job. She then walked away from me.

I also learned from another parent that she was 4 kids and is a single mom. This made me extremely sad and I can’t help but feel guilty for playing a role in having her fired. My husband told me she was probably gonna get fired anyways and said I shouldn’t feel bad.

AITA though? I feel so so horrible knowing that she cannot support her 4 kids anymore partially because of my complaint against her.

input: I really can’t tell if I was being too insensitive or not. 

A few friends and I were invited to play some touch football at the beach one day with some random people we met who were throwing around a football. After a while we were getting out of breath from all the activity and one of the guys made a joke saying something like “I’m going to end up tearing my other ACL.”

He talked a bit about it a bit later on telling us how he tore his ACL in high school and how it sucked.

After a while of playing, we all getting very tired and almost falling over. I ended up tripping myself out of fatigue when running for the ball and said something along the lines of “I better watch out or I’ll end up tearing my ACL.”

After saying that, the guy who tore his ACL started to criticize me about how tearing an ACL is a serious thing and shouldn’t be joked about.

I understand tearing an ACL is serious but this guy seemed perfectly fine playing the game and I thought it wasn’t too serious of a thing for him since he was making a joke about it earlier. AITA?

I asked him to get out, and my memory is not perfect but it led to him punching me in the face. I got angry and punched him in the shoulder. He looked aghast and told me that I had to move out by tomorrow because he didn't want to son like me. I'm going to talk to him tomorrow and hope that we can come to some sort of compromise.

Now complete the following example-
input: So I just recently found this subreddit and figured I would share my story from a couple of years ago.

I was in the cinema with some friends watching Super Bowl. Patriots vs Falcons. We had booked our seats several weeks prior in order to get the best possible seats just below the walking area, so we could just jump down instead of having to go all the way around and inconvinience people.

When we got there some guy had taken the very center seat and refused to move. So after several minutes of confrontations and threatening with getting the usher he finally moved a couple of seats to the side. But before he could move he ""accidentally"" spilled cola on my seat. Now I spent the first quarter of the game sitting on a soaking wet seat. This was so fucking frustrating and I had a hard time enjoying myself for what is a fun night of tradition with my friends.

Patriots were really far behind and this guy was an annoyance constantly making hand signatures and grunting whenever the refs would make ""a wrong call"". We are roughly down to 5 minutes of the first half and Patriots are behind with 20-25 points and this guy goes out to get some drinks before the halftime show. As he goes away I prepare my revenge.

He had locked his seat so he could jump down instead of going around. I however had noticed this and decided to unlock his seat so it would go back and forwards whenever you move in the seat. He comes back with a very big cola and as he steps into his seat he gets surprised about it not being locked, he trips and spills his drink all over himself while me, my friends and a good chunk of the cinema burst out laughing.

He ends up leaving, presumably to go get cleaned up, however he never returned, which I figure was due to his team losing badly.

Well for people who remember Patriots overcame a 25 points deficit and managed to win in the biggest Super Bowl comeback in history and this guy missed it all because he had to spill drinks on a seat he didn't even pay for in the first place. 

I ended up feeling like an asshole but at the same time it felt so good after having to sit on a soaking seat for almost 5 hours.
