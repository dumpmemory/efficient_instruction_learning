 Person2:sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ?  
 Person1:        I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .  
 Person2:that Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ?  
 Person1:        I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy .  
 Person2:if you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ?  
 Person1:        I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy .  
 Person2:you're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us .  
 Person1:        the Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food .  
 Person2:the Taj it is then .  
 Person1:        shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?  
 Person2:they'll still charge us a corkage fee .  
 Person1:        that's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .  
 Person2:don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight .  
 Person1:        are you sure ? We could go Dutch .  
 Person2:no , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time .  
 Person1:        I won't argue with that ! Let's go !
