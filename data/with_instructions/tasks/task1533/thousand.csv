 Person1:        It's been a full two years since we last saw each other .  
 Person2:So it is , I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years .  
 Person1:        We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement .  
 Person2:I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products .  
 Person1:        Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line .  
 Person2:Thank you .  
 Person1:        But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end .  
 Person2:That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ?  
 Person1:        500 pieces .  
 Person2:No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts .  
 Person1:        All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission .  
 Person2:I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged .  
 Person1:        We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own .  
 Person2:No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction .  
 Person1:        Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products .  
 Person2:Yes , we've already prepared one . I've brought it with me . I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow .

The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer . My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that . My cousin will be the official photographer . I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . Did you know that she ’ s going to be a professional opera singer ?  
 Person1:        Ah ...  
 Person2:And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ’ ll get the Youth Group to serve us . I was thinking that your friend ’ s band could be our entertainment for the night . though they might have to tone it down a bit . Or we could hire a DJ . Your sister ’ s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ’ s their name again ? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine . And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ’ ll make our toasts ! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? Who else am I missing ? Oh , your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake !  
 Person1:        Wow .  
 Person2:See ? It ’ s going to be wonderful ! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of .  
 Person1:        If I survive the next six months .

 Person1:        What about affirmative action ? Hasn't legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy ?

 Person2:I don't mind . By contrast , I quite like the circumstances , as I can see a variety of people here , who can always give me tremendous inspiration . And the most important thing is coffee as it is my life .  
 Person1:        I can see that . Then what is your favorite coffee ?  
 Person2:Irish coffee is my favorite . But I can drink any other . I'm not particular on it .  
 Person1:        All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?  
 Person2:Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee .  
 Person1:        I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient .  
 Person2:Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world ?  
 Person1:        Which country makes the best coffee in the world ?  
 Person2:Many people think Brazil makes the best coffee . Brazil exports a lot of coffee . But I love Irish coffee . So it's hard to say . Just depends on your taste .  
 Person1:        I agree . I heard in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ?  
 Person2:Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee .  
 Person1:        No , we don't , especially the old people . But more and more young people fall for coffee .  
 Person2:I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffeehouses in China now .

input:  Person1:       Do you have much experience with kids ?  
 Person2:Yes . I have three sons . Actually I also have a grandson .  
 Person1:        To tell you the truth , sometimes I regret having a baby so early . I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby .  
 Person2:I understand . I was in your position before . At that time I couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . My husband seldom stayed at home .  
 Person1:        What about your mother ? Did she help you ?  
 Person2:Yes , she did a little . But you see , Americans are different from Chinese . You can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . She could baby-sit only once or twice a week . That ’ s it . I had to care for them most of the time .  
 Person1:        I see . So if my little family goes to America , I would end up taking care of my child all the time . My husband would have to make the bread for us . I just don ’ t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day .  
 Person2:Don ’ t worry . You can take night classes . I did that when I had kids . And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . Then you could find a job and work .  
 Person1:        Sounds not so easy to me . When that happens , I will be too old to learn .  
 Person2:No . You see , I went back to school to get my Master ’ s Degree when I was in my thirties . You won ’ t be older than that .

 Person2:Sure I am . But he responded by saying'what do you mean ? ' .  
 Person1:        I'm confused . Why did he say that ?  
 Person2:I felt the same at first . Later he told me that I'd better not give him any suggestions when he was sick . Offering unsolicited help or advice is like showing sympathy to the weak or the poor . But back in China , helping others is always regarded being kind .  
 Person1:        Absolutely . Now I understand why he responded that way .

 Person2:It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine .  
 Person1:        Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops .  
 Person2:Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , butoften times I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine .  
 Person1:        True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ?  
 Person2:Not funny .

 Person2:I don't have the day off . Our labor union is staging a nationwide strike today , all of the workers in our department are supporting the labor union by participating and not going in to work this week .  
 Person1:        Are you serious ? Why would they have to go to such extreme measures like a strike ? Doesn't your company have a pretty good corporate image ? I'll bet the folks at headquarters are going nuts over something as serious as a strike ...  
 Person2:It happens quite often , actually.Whenever there arises a dispute between the union and the executive group , the first thing they do is to call a strike . Usually it only lasts a day or two before both sides can come to an agreement and we start work again . Anyhow , it's a nice , unanticipated holiday ...

 Person1:        Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ?

 Person1:        Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right .  
 Person2:It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make .  
 Person1:        Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy .  
 Person2:That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs .  
 Person1:        And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common .  
 Person2:Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college .  
 Person1:        Well , at least going to college won't be too bad . Since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college .  
 Person2:They do , but it doesn't help too much . Having seven children means that the money situation in my home is always pretty tight .

 Person1:        Did you have any difficulty getting along with fellow students or teachers ?  
 Person2:No . Not at all . I'm quite easy-going .  
 Person1:        What's your strong points ?  
 Person2:Oh , I'm very responsible , I can make fast decisions , and I do not need much supervision . I enjoy completing challenging tasks .  
 Person1:        What do you dislike most about your job ?  
 Person2:Probably routine , dull work . Oh , I am much more enthusiastic if I'm given a challenge and responsibility .  
 Person1:        What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a supervisor and employee ?  
 Person2:A friendly one . I think an open , friendly , honest relationship should exist . An employee should feel she ( he ) can go to her ( his ) boss anytime with any kind of question .  
 Person1:        Sometimes working with a foreign company can be stressful . Foreigners tend to get excited or angry easily , and they show it . Are you sure you can handle this stress ? How do you deal with conflict in your present job ?  
 Person2:Well , there's a lot of stress in a Chinese company also , although much of it is below the surface . I have confidence in my ability to handle conflict . If I have a problem with a co-worker , I do everything I can to work it out directly with that person . If I am unable to work it out , then I ask a supervisor to help out . If my boss shouts at me , I try not to take it personally . I try my best to understand the stress he is under . It's kind of like being in a family . Often family members say things in the heat of the moment , but don't mean what they say . A company is like a family , it has good times and bad times .  
 Person1:        How do you feel about overtime work ?  
 Person2:That's no problem . I know that every company has busy periods . When this happens , I'm ready to put in as much time as necessary to get the job done .  
 Person1:        What is most important to you in a job ?

 Person1:        Thank goodness we're not rich and famous !  
 Person2:Being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich .

 Person1:        Who was chairing the meeting ?  
 Person2:Bob .  
 Person1:        Well , I can tell you from experience that Bob might come off a little strong sometimes .  
 Person2:That's exactly what happened ! He kept interrupting everyone with his own suggestions and did not want to hear what others had to say . Then he expected everyone to agree with him .  
 Person1:        What was the meeting about ?  
 Person2:We were trying to come up with ideas to streamline the office's workflow to make it more efficient .  
 Person1:        It's ironic that the meeting was anything but efficient .  
 Person2:Exactly . I had tons of ideas that I wanted to share , but they just wouldn't let me finish . What should I have done to get my point across ?  
 Person1:        You have to keep things short and sweet . When you get a chance to speak , try not to get into too many unnecessary details .  
 Person2:Short and sweet ? But what if I have to explain something complicated ?  
 Person1:        You can always bring up the main points during the meeting and speak to those who are directly involved after the meeting . Not everyone needs to know all that information .  
 Person2:That's a good idea , I think I will try that at the next meeting .

 Person1:        I think it sounds like a good system . But when is it convenient to meet ?  
 Person2:Well , today is Monday.Actually , for me Monday at this time would be the best . I am free from now until 11

 Person2:I think that for a lot of people , it ’ s just a way to try and show their country is better than other countries .  
 Person1:        I think the Olympics help to promote world peace .  
 Person2:I ’ m not sure about that . We still have many wars in the world . I think that the idea behind the Olympics is a good one , but the reality is that during the Olympics countries compete . There ’ s no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other .  
 Person1:        You are so pessimistic ! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed , skill , agility and strength . Most people hope to see someone from their country win , but I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete .

input:  Person1:       Now I know why I split up with Mike . We found we were simply not good for each other .  
 Person2:In what ways ?  
 Person1:        Well , he is a typical Sagittarius guy , while I am a Cancer . We aren't really compatible  
 Person2:Ha-ha , so you believe in astrology ?  
 Person1:        What's strange about that ! As a person born under the sign of Cancer , I am home-loving and wish for a peaceful family life . But according to astrology , Sagittarius guys are too adventurous and risk-taking.They seldom think of leading a settled and peaceful life .  
 Person2:Is that so ? I'm afraid it is too narrow-minded to judge people using astrology . It's all stereotypes !  
 Person1:        But in my case , the fact matches the theory . Mike is humorous , energetic , always as fresh as a daisy , but probably too ambitious . It frightens me !  
 Person2:But as far as I remember , you two caught on like a house on fire when you first met .  
 Person1:        Exactly . But later on , he cares more about his career than love . Work seems to be the better all , and all for him-so much that he doesn't even grudge sparing a day out with me .

 Person2:It ’ s a program about islam . It ’ s very interesting .  
 Person1:        Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?  
 Person2:They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  
 Person1:        Why do they go there ?  
 Person2:Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .  
 Person1:        When muslims pray , they face towards mecca .  
 Person2:That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .  
 Person1:        I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .  
 Person2:That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  
 Person1:        Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  
 Person2:Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .  
 Person1:        Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?  
 Person2:I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .  
 Person1:        Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?  
 Person2:Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way .

 Person2:Don ’ t worry . I don't think you ’ re going to lose your job over one mistake .  
 Person1:        It was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , one small mistake can cost the company millions .  
 Person2:But it wasn ’ t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do .  
 Person1:        That ’ s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ’ s nothing I can do about that . My boss won ’ t believe me if I tell him the truth .  
 Person2:Let ’ s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ?  
 Person1:        I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ’ d rather invest my money somehow .  
 Person2:Well , you can't have everything . Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job . When is your contract up on your apartment ?  
 Person1:        Next month . So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year .  
 Person2:Well , that ’ s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money .  
 Person1:        That ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work .  
 Person2:If you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money .  
 Person1:        I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing !

 Person2:But my salary will be 1100 dollars a month.Will you pay me that much for the first month ? Because , I mean , I won't be working so many hours .  
 Person1:        I understand . That's why I didn't write the date on the contract.For the first two weeks , we will pay you according to the hours you teach.When you have 22 hours of classes , then the contract will take effect.Is that alright with you ?

 Person2:Is my membership the same as paying club members ? I mean , can I get discounts at club hotels ?  
 Person1:        Absolutely . The only difference is in the restaurant and bar vouchers .  
 Person2:What are bar vouchers ?  
 Person1:        Paying club members get around 300 dollars a year in restaurant vouchers.The vouchers can be used in the restaurant or the lounge.But we don't offer vouchers to employees .

Now complete the following example-
input:  Person1:       Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background .  
 Person2:I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used .  
 Person1:        What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ?  
 Person2:Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input .  
 Person1:        Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ?  
 Person2:There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort .  
 Person1:        Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome .  
 Person2:I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done .  
 Person1:        What are your strengths and weaknesses ?  
 Person2:My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more .  
 Person1:        Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss .  
 Person2:I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day .  
 Person1:        When do you find a job satisfying ?  
 Person2:My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner .  
 Person1:        How would your coworkers describe you ?  
 Person2:First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously .  
 Person1:        Do you have any questions ?  
 Person2:Yes , I do . On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ?
