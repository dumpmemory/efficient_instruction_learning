 Person1:        It's been a full two years since we last saw each other .  
 Person2:So it is , I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years .  
 Person1:        We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement .  
 Person2:I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products .  
 Person1:        Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line .  
 Person2:Thank you .  
 Person1:        But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end .  
 Person2:That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ?  
 Person1:        500 pieces .  
 Person2:No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts .  
 Person1:        All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission .  
 Person2:I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged .  
 Person1:        We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own .  
 Person2:No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction .  
 Person1:        Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products .  
 Person2:Yes , we've already prepared one . I've brought it with me . I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow .

The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer . My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that . My cousin will be the official photographer . I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . Did you know that she ’ s going to be a professional opera singer ?  
 Person1:        Ah ...  
 Person2:And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ’ ll get the Youth Group to serve us . I was thinking that your friend ’ s band could be our entertainment for the night . though they might have to tone it down a bit . Or we could hire a DJ . Your sister ’ s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ’ s their name again ? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine . And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ’ ll make our toasts ! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? Who else am I missing ? Oh , your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake !  
 Person1:        Wow .  
 Person2:See ? It ’ s going to be wonderful ! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of .  
 Person1:        If I survive the next six months .

 Person1:        do you think the glass ceiling phenomena is because of traditional social customs ? Or are there more issues coming into play ?  
 Person2:I think it's a very complicated issue . A part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers . Don't underestimate the good ole ' boy system . Men have power , so it's easier for them to stay in power .  
 Person1:        What about affirmative action ? Hasn't legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy ?
