They both work.)', '3 tablespoons Regular (not virgin) olive oil, unflavored peanut oil or bacon fat (or any mixture). Don't use anything too pungent here as it messes with the taste.

Mix gently on the sheetpan and then place back into the oven.', 'Roast at 250 degrees F. for one more hour. Mix and separate every 15 minutes so that the individual ingredients will be separate (you need to be particularly careful with the apples as they tend to stick together).', 'Alternatively you can mix all ingredients together in the large bowl and then roast them for 1 hour 15 min at 250 degrees F, turning every 15 min to separate, but I found that the nuts are lacking taste (they don't get toasted enough) and the fruit gets a bit charred and bitter.', 'After pulling the trail mix from the oven, let it cool before eating or storing.

In a heatproof container or top of a double boiler, put the chocolate and oil. Place it over, but not touching, a saucepan of barely simmering water. Stir over the hot water until the chocolate melts and is smooth. Remove from over the water and let it cool and thicken slightly, about 10 minutes. Scrape the chocolate coating into a small bowl. Dip the bottom of each macaroon in the chocolate and place each cookie, chocolate bottom facing up or on its side on a wire rack. You will have some chocolate coating leftover for another use or to pour over ice cream. Let the macaroons sit until the chocolate coating is firm, about 1 hour. To speed the firming of the chocolate, refrigerate the macaroons on the rack for about 15 minutes.', 'Serve cold or at room temperature.

input: ingredients:  '1530 grams of ox tails', '4 tablespoons of oil', '50 grams (approx 10 large thin slices) of ginger, thinly sliced', '12 cloves of garlic, roughly chopped', '2 red chilis, optional', '3 star anise', '2 teaspoons red sichuan peppercorn, coarsely ground', '1 tablespoon granulated sugar', '1/3 cup rice wine, or sake', '1/2 cup soy sauce + 1/8 cup for adjusting', '1 cup chicken broth, or water', '1 teaspoon rice vinegar',<sep> directions: 'NOTE: Because this dish involves caramelising the sugar, I strongly recommend doing the initial sauteing/woking in a NON-STICK pot, then transferring the ingredients to an oven-proof pot (like cast-iron) to finish braising in the oven. In a non-stick pot, the caramelised sugar sticks to the meat instead of to the bottom of the pot, which can easily burn in my experience. This process is called 'red braise' in Chinese cooking, referring to the amber/red sheen from the caramel.\r\n\r\nIt\'s quite important to grind the red sichuan peppercorn because they can be a bit unpleasant to bite into. You can use a stone mortar or spice grinder to do this, but if you have none, simply wrap the peppercorns in 2 layers of paper towel and smash them with a hammer.', 'Preheat the oven on 320°F/165°C.\r\n\r\nRinse clean and dry the ox tails with a clean towel. Heat up a large non-stick wok, or deep saute-pan with 4 tbsp of oil over HIGH heat (don't worry about the amount of oil because it will be removed later). Brown the ox tails in batches until all surfaces are covered and no more blood is being released. Set the ox tails aside. Drain the oil and leave only 2 tbsp in the wok/pan, and turn the heat down to MEDIUM. Add the ginger slices and cook until they shrivel up and get nicely browned on the edges, approx 5 min. Add the ox tails back into the wok/pan, along with garlic (if you like it spicy, add 2 red chilis as well), star anise, sichuan peppercorn and granulated sugar. Turn the heat back on HIGH, and keep turning the ingredients until the sugar has fully caramelised, and all the ingredients are coated in deep brown, amber sheen.', 'Transfer ALL the ingredients into a cast-iron or oven-proof pot, and return it to the stove. Add the rice wine and 1/2 cup of soy sauce, and let it gently boil with all the ingredients for a minute (turn and evenly coat the ingredients). Then add the chicken broth or water, and bring back to a simmer. The amount of liquid shouldn't be able to cover the ingredients (this isn't a stew), and should taste slightly UNDER-SEASONED at this point because of the excess water, which will evaporate during the braising process. If it taste generally BLAND, then adjust with more soy sauce.', 'Transfer the pot (with the lid on) to the oven and let braise for 3 ~ 3 1/2 hours. Go back and turn the ox tails once every hour or so to ensure even braising. The ox tails should be very tender and almost falling off the bone, and the braising liquid should have reduced dramatically.', 'After braising, carefully remove the ox tails from the braising liquid without tearing them. Tilt the pot to direct all the braising liquid to one side, and skim off as much fat from the surface as you can, without reducing the actual sauce on the bottom (there should be QUITE a lot of fat). Discard the star anise and ginger slices (press on the gingers to extract as much sauce that's clinging onto them before discarding). Leave the garlics which should have melted into the sauce at this point. Return the ox tails back into the pot, and return it to the stove over HIGH heat. Add 1 tsp of rice vinegar and reduce the sauce SLIGHTLY, just until the ox tails are coated in a shiny sheen.\r\n\r\nServe the ox tails over hot steamed rice. They get even better the next day.'

input: ingredients:  'Whole White Wheat Pizza Crust', '2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast', '1 teaspoon honey', '3/4 cup warm water (between 110°F to 115°F degrees-use a thermometer for best results)', '1-1/2 cups white whole wheat flour', '1/2 teaspoon salt', '1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil', 'Sauce &amp; Toppings', '3/4 cup white wine cashew cream sauce (recipe listed in my personal recipe section on Food52)', '6 medium scallops', 'juice from 1/2 lemon', 'salt and pepper, to taste', '2 cups flat-leaf parsley, lightly packed', '2 cups fresh mozzarella cheese, grated', '1/2 cup parmigiano-reggiano cheese, finely grated',<sep> directions: 'In a medium bowl, dissolve the yeast and honey in the 3/4 cup of warm water. Let it sit until it begins to foam, about 5 minutes. Measure out white whole wheat flour, mix in the salt, blend in the the olive oil, and stir into the yeast and honey mixture until well-blended. Dough will be thick and sticky. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm area for at least an hour, or up to 8 hours. As time passes, mixture should begin to bubble and expand slightly, creating the 'sponge' starter.', 'Once the sponge has fermented and you're ready to use it (after 1 to 8 hours), adjust oven rack to the second lowest position in the oven, and place pizza stone on rack. Preheat to 500°F.', 'Prep most of the toppings. Wash and dry parsley, remove leaves from stems, measure out 2 cups, then set aside. Grate 2 cups mozzarella cheese and set aside. Grate 1/2 cup parmigiano-reggiano cheese on a fine grater and set aside. Measure out about 3/4 cup white wine cashew cream sauce, set aside.', 'To finish the crust, sprinkle a flat work surface with flour. Scrape the dough from the bowl onto floured surface, then sprinkle more flour over the dough and knead until smooth, adding more flour if dough is too sticky, and roll dough into a small ball. Measure out a large piece of parchment paper, about 15'x15', and place dough on it. Flatten the dough slightly into a disk. Starting from the center of the dough, begin to spread the dough with your fingers, pushing from the center outwards, creating a rim all around and shaping dough into a round. Continue to consistently press the dough outwards, and as you do, the rim will become smaller as the circle increases in size. Press dough outwards until about 12' to 14' in diameter. Slide a large pizza peel underneath parchment paper and dough. Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.', 'While the pizza dough is resting, remove scallops from refrigerator. Heat about a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat. When oil is hot and shimmering, add scallops and briefly sear on each side, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Scallops should be slightly undercooked as they will finish cooking in the oven on the pizza. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Squeeze lemon juice over scallops. Set aside.', 'To finish the pizza, spread white wine cashew cream sauce over entire pizza up to the rim. Cut scallops in half, and spread evenly over pizza. Sprinkle mozzarella over pizza, and then sprinkle most of the parmigiano-reggiano cheese over pizza, reserving a heaping tablespoon. Spread parsley over entire pizza, leaving scallops exposed as much as possible. It will look like it's a lot of parsley, but it will shrink down when it cooks in the oven. Sprinkle remaining parmigiano-reggiano cheese evenly over the pizza. Open oven door and carefully slide pizza and parchment paper onto pizza stone. Cook until cheese looks bubbly and is starting to brown slightly. Slide pizza peel underneath parchment paper and remove pizza from oven onto large cutting board or protected surface. Cut into eight slices.'
