They both work.)', '3 tablespoons Regular (not virgin) olive oil, unflavored peanut oil or bacon fat (or any mixture). Don't use anything too pungent here as it messes with the taste.

Mix gently on the sheetpan and then place back into the oven.', 'Roast at 250 degrees F. for one more hour. Mix and separate every 15 minutes so that the individual ingredients will be separate (you need to be particularly careful with the apples as they tend to stick together).', 'Alternatively you can mix all ingredients together in the large bowl and then roast them for 1 hour 15 min at 250 degrees F, turning every 15 min to separate, but I found that the nuts are lacking taste (they don't get toasted enough) and the fruit gets a bit charred and bitter.', 'After pulling the trail mix from the oven, let it cool before eating or storing. Should be stored in an airtight bag or container to preserve crispness.'

Use a rubber spatula to fold half of the whipped egg white into the coconut mixture, then fold in the remaining white. Using an ice cream scoop with a 1/4 cup capacity or a 1/4 cup measuring cup, scoop mounds of the coconut batter onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing the macaroons two inches apart.', 'Bake until the bottoms of the cookies and the tips of the coconut shreds are light brown, about 17 minutes. Cool the cookies on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. Slide a metal spatula under the macaroons to loosen them from the parchment and transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.', 'Make the chocolate coating. In a heatproof container or top of a double boiler, put the chocolate and oil. Place it over, but not touching, a saucepan of barely simmering water. Stir over the hot water until the chocolate melts and is smooth. Remove from over the water and let it cool and thicken slightly, about 10 minutes. Scrape the chocolate coating into a small bowl. Dip the bottom of each macaroon in the chocolate and place each cookie, chocolate bottom facing up or on its side on a wire rack. You will have some chocolate coating leftover for another use or to pour over ice cream. Let the macaroons sit until the chocolate coating is firm, about 1 hour. To speed the firming of the chocolate, refrigerate the macaroons on the rack for about 15 minutes.', 'Serve cold or at room temperature. Store in the refrigerator in a covered container for up to 5 days.'
