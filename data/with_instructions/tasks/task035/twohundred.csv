For your question, PersonY should be a well-agreed answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use the names of real people or generic names (e.g., Donald Trump, John Doe, etc.) in your question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank. Make sure that PersonX and PersonY have the same gender.

Do not use the names of real people or generic names (e.g., Donald Trump, John Doe, etc.) in your question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank. Make sure that PersonX and PersonY have the same gender.

Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question.
