Dr. Spencer Reid: She 's drugging her male victims in order to keep them under her control for forty - eight hours , and we believe she 's using them as breeding partners to help replace the child that she lost .
David Rossi: Her victims are surrogates for a male figure in her life . One she may have already killed . He could be a boyfriend or husband who most likely fathered the child she lost .
Aaron Hotchner: And the signs of torture indicate that she may blame the child 's father for this loss and is exacting her revenge on these victims .
Alex Blake: After they 're dead , she dismembers them for easier disposal .
Derek Morgan: The strength required to do this , and transport body parts , it 's likely that she 's working with a submissive partner she dominates with her agenda .
David Rossi: Based on the sophistication and patience required for these crimes , we believe this unsub is probably in her thirties and no older than her early forties , if pregnancy is her goal .
Jennifer 'JJ' Jareau: And she works at night , luring victims from parties or bars . She may even have an illness , or feign one to gain their sympathy .
Aaron Hotchner: Chad Dumont 's been missing for almost thirty hours , and if the unsub keeps to her schedule , he may still be alive . But time is of the essence .
Dr. Spencer Reid: Even though the first two victims are dead , we can certainly step up our game so we can give the victims ' families some answers

Matt Murdock: No . Do you believe he exists ? In this world , among us .
Father Lantom: You want the short answer or the long _ one _ ?
Matt Murdock: Just the truth .
Father Lantom: When I was in seminary , I was more studious than pious , more ... skeptical than most of my peers . I had this notion , which I was more than willing to speak about , at length , to whoever I could corner . That the Devil ... was inconsequential . Minor figure in the grand scheme .
Matt Murdock: Not very Catholic of you .
Father Lantom: Uh - huh , yeah . In my defense , in the scriptures , the Hebrew word "" Satan "" actually means "" adversary . "" It 's applied to any antagonist . Angels and humans , serpents and kings . Medieval theologians reinterpreted those passages to be about a single monstrous enemy . And , in my youthful zeal , I was certain I knew why : propaganda . Played up to drive people into the church .
Matt Murdock: So you do n't believe he exists .
Father Lantom: Am I done talking ?
Father Lantom: Sorry
Father Lantom: Years later , I was in Rwanda , trying to help local churches provide aid and sanctuary to refugees . I 'd become close with the village elder , Gahiji . He and his family had the respect of everybody , Hutu and Tutsi alike . He 'd helped them all ; through famines , disease . The militia liked to force Hutu villagers to murder their neighbors ... with machetes . But nobody would raise a hand against Gahiji . They said , "" Well ... how can we kill such a holy man ? "" . So the militia commander sent soldiers ... with orders to cut his head off ... in front of the entire village . Gahiji did n't try to put up a fight . Just asked for the chance to say goodbye to his family . By the time he was done , even the soldiers did n't wanna kill him . So they went to their commander and asked permission to shoot him . At least give him a quick death . The commander wanted to meet this man who had won the respect of so many . He went to Gahiji ... talked with him in his hut , for many hours . Then he dragged him out in front of his village and hacked him to pieces ... along with his entire family . In that man who took Gahiji 's life ... I saw the Devil . So yes , Matthew ... I believe he walks among us ; taking many forms .
