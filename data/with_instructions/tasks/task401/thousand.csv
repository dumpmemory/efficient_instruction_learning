Dr. Spencer Reid: She 's drugging her male victims in order to keep them under her control for forty - eight hours , and we believe she 's using them as breeding partners to help replace the child that she lost .
David Rossi: Her victims are surrogates for a male figure in her life . One she may have already killed . He could be a boyfriend or husband who most likely fathered the child she lost .
Aaron Hotchner: And the signs of torture indicate that she may blame the child 's father for this loss and is exacting her revenge on these victims .
Alex Blake: After they 're dead , she dismembers them for easier disposal .
Derek Morgan: The strength required to do this , and transport body parts , it 's likely that she 's working with a submissive partner she dominates with her agenda .
David Rossi: Based on the sophistication and patience required for these crimes , we believe this unsub is probably in her thirties and no older than her early forties , if pregnancy is her goal .
Jennifer 'JJ' Jareau: And she works at night , luring victims from parties or bars . She may even have an illness , or feign one to gain their sympathy .
Aaron Hotchner: Chad Dumont 's been missing for almost thirty hours , and if the unsub keeps to her schedule , he may still be alive . But time is of the essence .
Dr. Spencer Reid: Even though the first two victims are dead , we can certainly step up our game so we can give the victims ' families some answers

Father Lantom: You want the short answer or the long _ one _ ?
Matt Murdock: Just the truth .
Father Lantom: When I was in seminary , I was more studious than pious , more ... skeptical than most of my peers . I had this notion , which I was more than willing to speak about , at length , to whoever I could corner . That the Devil ... was inconsequential . Minor figure in the grand scheme .
Matt Murdock: Not very Catholic of you .
Father Lantom: Uh - huh , yeah . In my defense , in the scriptures , the Hebrew word "" Satan "" actually means "" adversary . "" It 's applied to any antagonist . Angels and humans , serpents and kings . Medieval theologians reinterpreted those passages to be about a single monstrous enemy . And , in my youthful zeal , I was certain I knew why : propaganda . Played up to drive people into the church .
Matt Murdock: So you do n't believe he exists .
Father Lantom: Am I done talking ?
Father Lantom: Sorry
Father Lantom: Years later , I was in Rwanda , trying to help local churches provide aid and sanctuary to refugees . I 'd become close with the village elder , Gahiji . He and his family had the respect of everybody , Hutu and Tutsi alike . He 'd helped them all ; through famines , disease . The militia liked to force Hutu villagers to murder their neighbors ... with machetes . But nobody would raise a hand against Gahiji . They said , "" Well ... how can we kill such a holy man ? "" . So the militia commander sent soldiers ... with orders to cut his head off ... in front of the entire village . Gahiji did n't try to put up a fight . Just asked for the chance to say goodbye to his family . By the time he was done , even the soldiers did n't wanna kill him . So they went to their commander and asked permission to shoot him . At least give him a quick death . The commander wanted to meet this man who had won the respect of so many . He went to Gahiji ... talked with him in his hut , for many hours . Then he dragged him out in front of his village and hacked him to pieces ... along with his entire family . In that man who took Gahiji 's life ... I saw the Devil . So yes , Matthew ... I believe he walks among us ; taking many forms .

Must have a press tent - it 's a wedding . I must see pictures of meself with other people I 'm in the programme with . Oh , now I 'm pregnant - we must televise the birth . Quick , see if Ryan Seacrest will present it . Maybe it 'll make E ! channel 's "" 100 Greatest Caesarians "" . I 'm not having a go at you . I 'm just sick of these celebrities just living their lives out in the open all the time . Why would you do that ? It 's like these pop stars who choose the perfect moment to go into rehab . They call their publicist before they call a taxi . Then they come out and they do their second autobiography - this _ one _ 's called "" Love Me or I 'll Kill Myself "" . Well , kill yourself then . And the papers lap it up . They follow us around and that makes people think we 're important , and that makes us think we 're important . If they stop following us around , taking pictures of us , those people would n't take to the streets going "" Oh quick , I need a picture of Cameron Diaz with a pimple "" . They would n't care ; they 'd get on with something else . They 'd get on with their lives . You open the paper and you see a picture of Lindsay Lohan getting out of a car , and the headline is "" Cover Up Lindsay , We Can See Your Knickers "" . Of course you can see her knickers - your photographer is lying in the road , pointing his camera up her dress to see her knickers ! You 're literally the gutter press . And fuck you , the makers of this show , as well . You ca n't wash your hands in this . You ca n't keep going "" Oh , it 's exploitation , but it 's what the public want "" . No , the Victorian freak show never went away . Now it 's called "" Big Brother "" or "" American Idol "" , where , in the preliminary rounds , we wheel out the bewildered to be sniggered at by multimillionaires . And fuck you for watching this at home . Shame on you . And shame on me . I 'm the worst of all 'cause I 'm one of those people that goes "" Oh , I 'm an entertainer , it 's in my blood "" . Yeah , it 's in my blood , 'cause a real job 's too hard . I would love to have been a doctor - too hard . Did n't want to put the work in . Would love to be a war hero - I 'm too scared . So I go "" Oh , it 's what I do "" . And I have someone bollocked if my cappuccino is cold , or if they look at me the wrong way . You know what a friend of mine once said ? They said I 'll never be happy 'cause I 'll never be famous enough . And they were right . And if you 're watching this , I 'm so sorry . You 're my best friend . You 're my only friend . And you never did anything wrong . It was everything else . I 'll never do that again . I 'll never treat you like that again . It 's eating me that you asked me a stupid question once , and I just ... I could 've answered it and I did n't , 'cause I was ... I 'll answer it now : I 'd be the penguin , 'cause I could eat the flying fish . I know what you 're thinking - "" why does n't the fish fly away ? "" Well , it ca n't really fly ; it 's all glide and flap . They should be called ' glidey flappy fish ' . I 'm so sorry .

David Rossi: He creates a character identity instead of a reality , and when a person steps outside of the parameters that the unsub has set for them , he strikes .
Jennifer Jareau: This unsub appears to be triggered by males acting on what he perceives to be character flaws . Seemingly innocuous infractions to us are magnified in the unsub 's psychosis .
Aaron Hotchner: Based on the planning and sophistication of the kills , we believe that he 's in his late thirties or forties .
Dr. Spencer Reid: The geographic profile tells us this unsub is not only dumping his victims downtown , he 's hunting there , too .
Derek Morgan: So this is where we need to redouble our efforts . Go building to building , door to door . This guy 's a fly on the wall ; he 's able to leanr secrets without anyone realizing he 's there .
Alex Blake: He 'll have a job that involves very little social interaction , but that puts him in a position where he can observe others unnoticed .
Jennifer Jareau: So we should look at service workers , groundskeepers , anyone paid to be invisible .
Aaron Hotchner: And we need to move quickly . This unsub is approaching some sort of perceived deadline . The closer it gets , the more erratic and dangerous he 'll become .

Tony Hitchman: Well , Mr. Hubbard , it 's obviously something that 's very wide - ranging , and if you ca n't describe it overall , perhaps we can begin at the beginning . How did you get into Scientology ? How did it all start ?
L. Ron Hubbard: Well , that - that is fairly easy . When I was , uh , a very young man , I spent most of my teens in Asia . And , uh , that is a , an area of the world , uh , where human misery and , uh , want , uh , are , uh , very visible , where , uh , Man has reached perhaps the lowest states of degradation , and a young man moving into that scene begins to ask the question , "" Why ? Why all this ? Why - What is this ? Uh , what depths can man fall to , and what is he , anyway ? "" And I began to ask this question , "" What is Man ? "" And , uh , I found oddly enough that nobody could tell me what Man was . Uh , what did he consist of , uh , where was he going , what was he doing ? I became very fascinated with this particular line of research and I made it my life 's work .
Tony Hitchman: Did you read widely of philosophy ?
L. Ron Hubbard: Yes , but the philosopher , of course , has spent most of his working years in his ivory towers , and he was pretty insulated from life . To really know life , you 've got to be part of life . You must get down and look , you must get into the , the nooks and crannies of existence there , you have to rub elbows with all kinds and types of men before you can finally establish what he is .
Tony Hitchman: And you in fact did this ?
L. Ron Hubbard: Yes , I 've slept with bandits in Mongolia and I 've , uh , uh , hunted , uh , with , uh pygmies in the Phillipines ; as a matter of fact , I 've studied _ 21 _ , uh , different primitive races , uh , including the white race ...

See the world , maybe be of service . Charlie did n't wanna go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale , which is what I would do . He did n't go to Paris or Amsterdam , which sounds fun .

I mean , we wo n't know because we dropped a building on him while we were kickin ' ass ... There 's no decision - making process here . We need to be put in check ! And whatever form that takes , I 'm game . If we ca n't accept limitations , we 're boundaryless , we 're no better than the bad guys .
Steve Rogers: Tony , if someone dies on your watch , you do n't give up .
Tony Stark: Who said we 're giving up ?
Steve Rogers: We are if we 're not taking responsibility for our actions . This document just shifts the blame .
Lt. Col. James Rhodes: Sorry , Steve , that ... that is dangerously arrogant . This is the United Nations we 're talking about . It 's not the World Security Council , it 's not S.H.I.E.L.D. , it 's not Hydra .
Steve Rogers: No , but it 's run by people with agendas and agendas change .
Tony Stark: That 's good ! That 's why I 'm here . When I realized what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands , I shut it down . Stopped manufacturing .
Steve Rogers: Tony , you * chose * to do that . If we sign this , we surrender our right to choose . What if this panel sends us somewhere we do n't think we should go ? What if there 's somewhere we need to go and they do n't let us ? We may not be perfect but the safest hands are still our own .
Tony Stark: If we do n't do this now , it 's gon na be done to us later . That 's the fact . That wo n't be pretty .

Aaron Hotchner: The unsub uses a garrote to strangle his victims . He strikes at night , and there have been no witnesses .
David Rossi: How much did he get ?
Aaron Hotchner: What 's odd . Each of the victims ' socio - economically is lower to middle class . It 's doubtful there would have been much cash , and there have been no charge attempts on any of the credit cards .

Penelope Garcia: That could be the sitch with the first two victims , but the latest _ one _ , Scott Delfino , he was on the phone with his roommate when he was attacked ; call cut out unexpectedly , repeated callbacks went straight to voicemail .
Aaron Hotchner: And Delfino 's body was found an hour later , indications were that he 'd been blitzed .

Jennifer Jareau: Well , that could be arrogance getting in the way , making his organization appear mixed . To me , that screams false confidence .
Derek Morgan: Which means the desperation is what 's driving him . It 's not about the kills , it 's about what the murders represent .
Jennifer Jareau: He 's mission oriented . He does n't want to kill them , he has to .
David Rossi: Which suggests the unsub has no personal connection to his victims .
Alex Blake: Except choking as a kill method is extremely personal . He feels each victim take their last breath .
Derek Morgan: What if the wallets are a form of depersonalization ? He 's stripping his victims of their identities .
Dr. Spencer Reid: Which means he may feel stripped of his own . If the wallets are trophies , he could be seeking recognition for his work .
Aaron Hotchner: And he may not stop killing until he gets that recognition . Let 's go .

Dexter Morgan: Maybe .
Dr. Evelyn Vogel: Mad scientists , trained to look at this as a biological mass , a body part . Yet , somehow , from all those firings of neurons , something ... intangible emerges . Emotions . Trust , morality , love . Unless you 're a psychopath . But even then , belief systems emerge ... as with the ... Bay Harbor Butcher . What was he like ?
Dexter Morgan: Who ?
Dr. Evelyn Vogel: The Bay Harbor Butcher . James Doakes . I- if I 'm not mistaken , he worked with you here in Miami Metro .
Dexter Morgan: He was angry . Had a short fuse .
Dr. Evelyn Vogel: Well , that does n't sound right to me . As a psychopath , he would be disassociated with his feelings , not quick to anger .
Dexter Morgan: Maybe he was n't a psychopath .
Dr. Evelyn Vogel: Oh , yes , the Bay Harbor Butcher was definitely a psychopath . He 'd have to be to masquerade the way he did . But he was an odd _ one _ , that 's for sure .
Dexter Morgan: You 're the expert .
Dr. Evelyn Vogel: Just the way he picked his victims - persons who , on the whole , had some sort of criminal background - speaks to a ... strong belief system , almost as if he operated with some sort of ... moral guidelines .
Dexter Morgan: "" Guidelines "" .
Dr. Evelyn Vogel: Yeah , clearly it was n't a moral choice , as psychopaths have no conscience . So , why else would he kill that way ?
Dexter Morgan: So he could ... get away with it as long as he did ? People are less likely to miss criminals when they disappear . Doakes was Special Ops ; maybe he picked it up from there .
Dr. Evelyn Vogel: Maybe he did . Makes an interesting case study . I wish I could have interviewed him .
Dexter Morgan: Sorry .
Dr. Evelyn Vogel: I look forward to working with you , Dexter Morgan .

Boomstick: At fifteen , he was already so powerful that the only worthy teachers left were gods ... and a talking cat , but mostly GODS ! He was only a kid and already , his power level was already enormous !
Vegeta: It 's over 9000 !
Boomstick: Not yet ! Okay , now it is .
Wizard: FALSE ! In the Japanese manga , Goku 's power level at that time was _ 8000 _ . But it does n't even matter because power levels are absurd . The entire point of introducing them was to show how unreliable and meaningless they were . By relying on power levels , the villains constantly underestimated the heroes . Therefore , using them to judge Goku 's abilities is pointless . Besides , the Daizenshuu says that ...
Boomstick: Dai - what now ?
Wizard: The Official Dragonball Encyclopedia . It states power levels eventually become immeasurable , not because they are so high they ca n't be measured , but because the characters , and hopefully the audience , have realized just how futile these numbers are . We can not judge Goku by his power level , nor can we through power scaling , the theory that he can achieve the same feats as lesser Dragonball characters . Goku 's abilities are tailored to his personal training and experiences , not to mention anatomy .
Boomstick: However , Goku does have a knack for mimicking ki techniques .
Wizard: Ki is metaphysical , made up of things such as vigor , courage and being in one 's true mind .
Boomstick: It 's basically a kind of natural life force energy and is a fundamental component of Daoist medicine and martial arts . Oh , and uh , it 's NOT magic !
Wizard: Dragonball creates a very distinct difference between ki and magic . Ki is dependent on the physical ability of the user and magic - users like Babidi are clearly using something different . Goku harnesses and manipulates his ki energy ...
Boomstick: Into badass lasers and stuff , like ki blasts , energy barriers and the Destructo Disc , which he totally stole from Krillin . The Solar Flare blinds opponents and the Spirit Bomb puts energy from other things into a giant death ball ... that takes freaking forever to make .
Wizard: And energy taken from sentient beings must be voluntary . The Spirit Bomb is fueled by positive energy which is only effective against those filled with negative energy , AKA evil . In the Super Android 13 film , Goku actually absorbs the ki gathered from the Spirit Bomb , becoming one with it , transforming and manipulating the energy himself .
Boomstick: But his two best moves are the Dragon Fist , where he super - charges his punch with a golden ki dragon and the one and only Kamehameha : a giant focused beam which every kid in the world has always wanted to do . Do n't lie , you 've tried it .
Wizard: Goku also uses ki for telekinesis and high - speed flight . He can even sense the power and location of other ki sources and then teleport directly to them with Instant Transmission .
Boomstick: Which is light speed !
Goku: You dematerialize and travel as a mass of light .
Wizard: Again , FALSE ! This is another mistake in translation . According to the original manga , "" Instant Transmission is ... well ... instant . "" Its only flaw is that it requires concentrated focus . Also , he can read minds .
Boomstick: Wait , what ? Is there no limit to this ki thing ?
Wizard: There is . Goku draws from a finite pool of ki energy . So to increase his power , Goku perfected the art of Kaio - Ken . This amplifies Goku 's ki , multiplying his strength , speed , defense and so on .
Boomstick: Only one problem : it puts a giant strain on body and can even kill him .

And once they 've pulled off their vicious acts , the _ two _ accept this as common behavior and become bored with normal activity . They live only for their new reality .

Now complete the following example-
input: Wizard:  So , Superman 's feats and skills are definitively measured . However , Goku 's are not and are difficult to judge . Not only does Dragonball heavily abuse cinematic time , but Goku 's final adventures in Dragonball GT are incredibly inconsistent due to his untimely transformation into a child . As ki is dependent on the physical body , his child form likely could not handle his own ki , sending his power into flux .
Boomstick: And obviously , we 're not using future Goku 'cause that would require a ridiculous amount of assumption . Not to mention we 'd have to use future Superman , who 's pretty much God . So , like Superman , we need to judge Goku in his prime .
Wizard: After experimenting with dozens of different theories , we discovered an iron - clad method to finding Goku 's limits , which we call the Gravity Formula , based around his training in increased gravity . Due to his style of training and Saiyan heritage , Goku increases his abilities proportionate to the amount of force he trains under . While in base form , Goku could lift just under 40 tons . This is equivalent to 586x normal Earth gravity , which we will use in the Gravity Formula along with the Super Saiyan multipliers to calculate Goku 's maximum potential .
Boomstick: Multiplying the 40 tons by the Super Saiyan forms means he can lift up to 160000 tons in Super Saiyan 4 , strong enough to pick up a continent ... or my ex - wife . Ha ha ! Right after Goku trained on King Kai 's planet , which has gravity 10x stronger than Earth 's , he flew across Snake Way Road as fast as possible to save his friends . It took him 28 hours , impressive since that 's 1000000 kilometers long .
Wizard: Except it 's filled with curves and Goku flew straight over it , so how far did he actually travel ? By comparing Goku 's height to a single spike , we can measure each curve . We can then remove those curves from the overall length . So it turns out that Goku actually flew 307000 kilometers , nearly 11000 km / h .
Boomstick: To see how fast his base form is at the end of the series , we run the Snake Way number through the gravity formula to find that his top speed clocks in at over 2 1/2 billion km / h , over 2x the speed of light .
Wizard: We can determine Goku 's durability through this bomb , which the brilliant Dr. Gero designed to kill Goku at age 25 , when his maximum potential was Kaio - Ken x4 .
Boomstick: Scans of the bomb display a TNT measurement of _ 657 _ . Bulma says the bomb could destroy the Earth , so this is likely measured in quadrillion megatons , since it takes at least 53 quadrillion megatons of force to destroy the Earth .
Wizard: So in his final form , Goku can survive up to nearly 35 sextillion megatons .
Boomstick: Goku does n't rely solely on his physical abilities . He amplifies his strength and durability with ki .
Wizard: But even though his ki reserves can not be measured , we can determine his maximum output . See , his ki attacks do not force him backward unless he allows them to .
Boomstick: Even when firing upward at full power , the ground beneath him remains untouched .
Wizard: Therefore , according to physics , his maximum output is at most equal to the amount of force he can withstand .
Boomstick: Luckily , we just calculated that with the Gero bomb .
output: ",measurement

And , just as ironically , missed one who would prove to be his greatest adversary .
Boomstick - Host: This lone Lombax 's name was Ratchet , and he spent most of his days stranded on a random planet , dicking around with mechanical stuff , and dreaming of one day exploring the galaxy . So , this alien ... kitty cat ... thing scrounged up all the scraps he can find , used his natural gift with machines , and built a space ship so incredible , it would finally take him off this boring planet once and for ...

Boomstick - Host: Yeah , see , he came from a robot killing machine making factory , but when the factory malfunctioned and made this little guy , it decided to scrap him for parts . So , naturally , he got the hell out of there , ended up with Ratchet , and together they became the greatest hero duo in the galaxy .
