Dr. Spencer Reid: She 's drugging her male victims in order to keep them under her control for forty - eight hours , and we believe she 's using them as breeding partners to help replace the child that she lost .
David Rossi: Her victims are surrogates for a male figure in her life . One she may have already killed . He could be a boyfriend or husband who most likely fathered the child she lost .
Aaron Hotchner: And the signs of torture indicate that she may blame the child 's father for this loss and is exacting her revenge on these victims .
Alex Blake: After they 're dead , she dismembers them for easier disposal .
Derek Morgan: The strength required to do this , and transport body parts , it 's likely that she 's working with a submissive partner she dominates with her agenda .
David Rossi: Based on the sophistication and patience required for these crimes , we believe this unsub is probably in her thirties and no older than her early forties , if pregnancy is her goal .
Jennifer 'JJ' Jareau: And she works at night , luring victims from parties or bars . She may even have an illness , or feign one to gain their sympathy .
Aaron Hotchner: Chad Dumont 's been missing for almost thirty hours , and if the unsub keeps to her schedule , he may still be alive . But time is of the essence .
Dr. Spencer Reid: Even though the first two victims are dead , we can certainly step up our game so we can give the victims ' families some answers
