Medical device manufacturers must also notify the FDA within five days of widely disseminating to health care providers in a foreign country communications relating to a change to the recommended reprocessing protocols, if any, for their device, or a safety concern about the device. The bill bans the devices if the manufacturers violate the notification requirements concerning those design or reprocessing changes or communications to foreign health care providers. The FDA must publish a list of the types of rapid assessment tests of reusable devices for which premarket notification must include proposed labeling, including validated instructions regarding sanitizing reusable devices.

input: Restoring Access to Medication and Improving Health Savings Act of 2016  This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to modify the rules that apply to health savings accounts (HSAs) and overpayments of subsidies under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  Restoring Access to Medication Act of 2016  The bill repeals provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, as added by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, that limit payments for medications from HSAs, medical savings accounts, and health flexible spending arrangements to only prescription drugs or insulin (thus allowing distributions from such accounts for over-the-counter drugs).  Health Care Security Act of 2016  The bill modifies the rules for HSAs with respect to catch-up contributions for married couples, medical expenses incurred before an HSA is established, and contribution limits.  If both spouses of a married couple have family coverage under a high deductible health plan, each spouse may make catch-up contributions to the same HSA. (Catch-up contributions are additional contributions which individuals who are at least 55 years of age may make to an HSA.)  If an HSA is established within 60 days of the beginning of coverage under a high deductible health plan, any distribution from the HSA used to pay a qualified medical expense incurred during that 60-day period after the health coverage began is excludible from gross income. (Under current law, the medical expense must be incurred on or after the date that the HSA is established.)  The bill increases the maximum contribution limits for HSAs to equal the maximum for the sum of the annual deductible and out-of-pocket expenses that may be required to be paid for covered benefits under a high deductible health plan.  Protecting Taxpayers by Recovering Improper Obamacare Subsidy Overpayments Act  The bill eliminates the limitation on the increase in tax imposed upon certain low-income families for advance payments of the tax credit for health insurance premium assistance that exceed the allowable amount of such credit.
