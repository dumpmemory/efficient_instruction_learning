input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

input: How do news sources tackle controversial issues? In this work, we take a data-driven approach to understand how controversy interplays with emotional expression and biased language in the news. We begin by introducing a new dataset of controversial and noncontroversial terms collected using crowdsourcing. Then, focusing on 15 major U.S. news outlets, we compare millions of articles discussing controversial and non-controversial issues over a span of 7 months. We find that in general, when it comes to controversial issues, the use of negative affect and biased language is prevalent, while the use of strong emotion is tempered. We also observe many differences across news sources. Using these findings, we show that we can indicate to what extent an issue is controversial, by comparing it with other issues in terms of how they are portrayed across different media.

input: Due to the intractable nature of exact lifted inference, research has recently focused on the discovery of accurate and efficient approximate inference algorithms in Statistical Relational Models (SRMs), such as Lifted First-Order Belief Propagation. FOBP simulates propositional factor graph belief propagation without constructing the ground factor graph by identifying and lifting over redundant message computations. In this work, we propose a generalization of FOBP called Lifted Generalized Belief Propagation, in which both the region structure and the message structure can be lifted. This approach allows more of the inference to be performed intra-region (in the exact inference step of BP), thereby allowing simulation of propagation on a graph structure with larger region scopes and fewer edges, while still maintaining tractability. We demonstrate that the resulting algorithm converges in fewer iterations to more accurate results on a variety of SRMs.

input: In last few years there are major changes and evolution has been done on classification of data. As the application area of technology is increases the size of data also increases. Classification of data becomes difficult because of unbounded size and imbalance nature of data. Class imbalance problem become greatest issue in data mining. Imbalance problem occur where one of the two classes having more sample than other classes. The most of algorithm are more focusing on classification of major sample while ignoring or misclassifying minority sample. The minority samples are those that rarely occur but very important. There are different methods available for classification of imbalance data set which is divided into three main categories, the algorithmic approach, datapreprocessing approach and feature selection approach. Each of this technique has their own advantages and disadvantages. In this paper systematic study of each approach is define which gives the right direction for research in class imbalance problem.

input: Words in natural language follow a Zipfian distribution whereby some words are frequent but most are rare. Learning representations for words in the “long tail” of this distribution requires enormous amounts of data. Representations of rare words trained directly on end-tasks are usually poor, requiring us to pre-train embeddings on external data, or treat all rare words as out-of-vocabulary words with a unique representation. We provide a method for predicting embeddings of rare words on the fly from small amounts of auxiliary data with a network trained against the end task. We show that this improves results against baselines where embeddings are trained on the end task in a reading comprehension task, a recognizing textual entailment task, and in language modelling.

input: Replacing a portion of current light duty vehicles (LDV) with plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) offers the possibility to reduce the dependence on petroleum fuels together with environmental and economic benefits. The charging activity of PHEVs will certainly introduce new load to the power grid. In the framework of the development of a smarter grid, the primary focus of the present study is to propose a model for the electrical daily demand in presence of PHEVs charging. Expected PHEV demand is modeled by the PHEV charging time and the starting time of charge according to real world data. A normal distribution for starting time of charge is assumed. Several distributions for charging time are considered: uniform distribution, Gaussian with positive support, Rician distribution and a non-uniform distribution coming from driving patterns in real-world data. We generate daily demand profiles by using real-world residential profiles throughout 2014 in the presence of different expected PHEV demand models. Support vector machines (SVMs), a set of supervised machine learning models, are employed in order to find the best model to fit the data. SVMs with radial basis function (RBF) and polynomial kernels were tested. Model performances are evaluated by means of mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Best results are obtained with RBF kernel: maximum (worst) values for MSE and MAPE were about 2.89 10 and 0.023, respectively. Keywords—Energy demand, plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), smart grids, support vector machines.

We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset.

input: Multimedia or spoken content presents more attractive information than plain text content, but it’s more difficult to display on a screen and be selected by a user. As a result, accessing large collections of the former is much more difficult and time-consuming than the latter for humans. It’s highly attractive to develop a machine which can automatically understand spoken content and summarize the key information for humans to browse over. In this endeavor, we propose a new task of machine comprehension of spoken content. We define the initial goal as the listening comprehension test of TOEFL, a challenging academic English examination for English learners whose native language is not English. We further propose an Attention-based Multi-hop Recurrent Neural Network (AMRNN) architecture for this task, achieving encouraging results in the initial tests. Initial results also have shown that word-level attention is probably more robust than sentence-level attention for this task with ASR errors.

input: The efficiency of inference in both the Hugin and, most notably, the Shafer-Shenoy archi­ tectures can be improved by exploiting the independence relations induced by the incom­ ing messages of a clique. That is, the mes­ sage to be sent from a clique can be com­ puted via a factorization of the clique poten­ tial in the form of a junction tree. In this pa­ per we show that by exploiting such nested junction trees in the computation of messages both space and time costs of the conventional propagation methods may be reduced. The paper presents a structured way of exploit­ ing the nested junction trees technique to achieve such reductions. The usefulness of the method is emphasized through a thor­ ough empirical evaluation involving ten large real-world Bayesian networks and the Hugin inference algorithm.

input: Mobile edge computing (a.k.a. fog computing) has recently emerged to enable in-situ processing of delay-sensitive applications at the edge of mobile networks. Providing grid power supply in support of mobile edge computing, however, is costly and even infeasible (in certain rugged or under-developed areas), thus mandating on-site renewable energy as a major or even sole power supply in increasingly many scenarios. Nonetheless, the high intermittency and unpredictability of renewable energy make it very challenging to deliver a high quality of service to users in energy harvesting mobile edge computing systems. In this paper, we address the challenge of incorporating renewables into mobile edge computing and propose an efficient reinforcement learning-based resource management algorithm, which learns on-the-fly the optimal policy of dynamic workload offloading (to the centralized cloud) and edge server provisioning to minimize the long-term system cost (including both service delay and operational cost). Our online learning algorithm uses a decomposition of the (offline) value iteration and (online) reinforcement learning, thus achieving a significant improvement of learning rate and runtime performance when compared to standard reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning. We prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm and analytically show that the learned policy has a simple monotone structure amenable to practical implementation. Our simulation results validate the efficacy of our algorithm, which significantly improves the edge computing performance compared to fixed or myopic optimization schemes and conventional reinforcement learning algorithms.

input: There is a vast amount of unstructured Arabic information on the Web, this data is always organized in semi-structured text and cannot be used directly. This research proposes a semi-supervised technique that extracts binary relations between two Arabic named entities from the Web. Several works have been performed for relation extraction from Latin texts and as far as we know, there isn’t any work for Arabic text using a semi-supervised technique. The goal of this research is to extract a large list or table from named entities and relations in a specific domain. A small set of a handful of instance relations are required as input from the user. The system exploits summaries from Google search engine as a source text. These instances are used to extract patterns. The output is a set of new entities and their relations. The results from four experiments show that precision and recall varies according to relation type. Precision ranges from 0.61 to 0.75 while recall ranges from 0.71 to 0.83. The best result is obtained for (player, club) relationship, 0.72 and 0.83 for precision and recall respectively.

input: We discuss relations between Residual Networks (ResNet), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and the primate visual cortex. We begin with the observation that a shallow RNN is exactly equivalent to a very deep ResNet with weight sharing among the layers. A direct implementation of such a RNN, although having orders of magnitude fewer parameters, leads to a performance similar to the corresponding ResNet. We propose 1) a generalization of both RNN and ResNet architectures and 2) the conjecture that a class of moderately deep RNNs is a biologically-plausible model of the ventral stream in visual cortex. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the architectures by testing them on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

input: Despite recent advances, the remaining bottlenecks in deep generative models are necessity of extensive training and difficulties with generalization from small number of training examples. Both problems may be addressed by conditional generative models that are trained to adapt the generative distribution to additional input data. So far this idea was explored only under certain limitations such as restricting the input data to be a single object or multiple objects representing the same concept. In this work we develop a new class of deep generative model called generative matching networks which is inspired by the recently proposed matching networks for one-shot learning in discriminative tasks and the ideas from meta-learning. By conditioning on the additional input dataset, generative matching networks may instantly learn new concepts that were not available during the training but conform to a similar generative process, without explicit limitations on the number of additional input objects or the number of concepts they represent. Our experiments on the Omniglot dataset demonstrate that generative matching networks can significantly improve predictive performance on the fly as more additional data is available to the model and also adapt the latent space which is beneficial in the context of feature extraction.

These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

Now complete the following example-
input: We propose k-means, a new clustering method which efficiently copes with large numbers of clusters and achieves low energy solutions. k-means builds upon the standard k-means (Lloyd’s algorithm) and combines a new strategy to accelerate the convergence with a new low time complexity divisive initialization. The accelerated convergence is achieved through only looking at kn nearest clusters and using triangle inequality bounds in the assignment step while the divisive initialization employs an optimal 2-clustering along a direction. The worst-case time complexity per iteration of our k-means is O(nknd+ kd), where d is the dimension of the n data points and k is the number of clusters and usually n k kn. Compared to k-means’ O(nkd) complexity, our k-means complexity is significantly lower, at the expense of slightly increasing the memory complexity by O(nkn + k). In our extensive experiments k-means is order(s) of magnitude faster than standard methods in computing accurate clusterings on several standard datasets and settings with hundreds of clusters and high dimensional data. Moreover, the proposed divisive initialization generally leads to clustering energies comparable to those achieved with the standard k-means++ initialization, while being significantly faster.

input: We investigate evaluation metrics for endto-end dialogue systems where supervised labels, such as task completion, are not available. Recent works in end-to-end dialogue systems have adopted metrics from machine translation and text summarization to compare a model’s generated response to a single target response. We show that these metrics correlate very weakly or not at all with human judgements of the response quality in both technical and non-technical domains. We provide quantitative and qualitative results highlighting specific weaknesses in existing metrics, and provide recommendations for future development of better automatic evaluation metrics for dialogue systems.

input: Eliminating the negative effect of highly non-stationary environmental noise is a long-standing research topic for speech recognition but remains an important challenge nowadays. To address this issue, traditional unsupervised signal processing methods seem to have touched the ceiling. However, data-driven based supervised approaches, particularly the ones designed with deep learning, have recently emerged as potential alternatives. In this light, we are going to comprehensively summarise the recently developed and most representative deep learning approaches to deal with the raised problem in this article, with the aim of providing guidelines for those who are going deeply into the field of environmentally robust speech recognition. To better introduce these approaches, we categorise them into singleand multi-channel techniques, each of which is specifically described at the front-end, the back-end, and the joint framework of speech recognition systems. In the meanwhile, we describe the pros and cons of these approaches as well as the relationships among them, which can probably benefit future research.

In this study, we build NMT systems using only synthetic parallel data. As an efficient alternative to real parallel data, we also present a new type of synthetic parallel corpus. The proposed pseudo parallel data are distinct from previous works in that ground truth and synthetic examples are mixed on both sides of sentence pairs. Experiments on Czech-German and French-German translations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed pseudo parallel corpus, which shows not only enhanced results for bidirectional translation tasks but also substantial improvement with the aid of a ground truth real parallel corpus.

Automated Driving (AD) has potential to drastically reduce such accidents. In this work, we focus on the technical challenges that arise from AD in urban environments. We present the overall architecture of an AD system and describe in detail the perception and planning modules. The AD system, built on a modified Acura RLX, was demonstrated in a course in GoMentum Station in California. We demonstrated autonomous handling of 4 scenarios: traffic lights, cross-traffic at intersections, construction zones and pedestrians. The AD vehicle displayed safe behavior and performed consistently in repeated demonstrations with slight variations in conditions. Overall, we completed 44 runs, encompassing 110km of automated driving with only 3 cases where the driver intervened the control of the vehicle, mostly due to error in GPS positioning. Our demonstration showed that robust and consistent behavior in urban scenarios is possible, yet more investigation is necessary for full scale rollout on public roads.

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

input: Bio-inspired optimization algorithms have been gaining more popularity recently. One of the most important of these algorithms is particle swarm optimization (PSO). PSO is based on the collective intelligence of a swam of particles. Each particle explores a part of the search space looking for the optimal position and adjusts its position according to two factors; the first is its own experience and the second is the collective experience of the whole swarm. PSO has been successfully used to solve many optimization problems. In this work we use PSO to improve the performance of a well-known representation method of time series data which is the symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX). As with other time series representation methods, SAX results in loss of information when applied to represent time series. In this paper we use PSO to propose a new minimum distance WMD for SAX to remedy this problem. Unlike the original minimum distance, the new distance sets different weights to different segments of the time series according to their information content. This weighted minimum distance enhances the performance of SAX as we show through experiments using different time series datasets.

input: N-tuple networks have been successfully used as position evaluation functions for board games such as Othello or Connect Four. The effectiveness of such networks depends on their architecture, which is determined by the placement of constituent n-tuples, sequences of board locations, providing input to the network. The most popular method of placing ntuples consists in randomly generating a small number of long, snake-shaped board location sequences. In comparison, we show that learning n-tuple networks is significantly more effective if they involve a large number of systematically placed, short, straight n-tuples. Moreover, we demonstrate that in order to obtain the best performance and the steepest learning curve for Othello it is enough to use n-tuples of size just 2, yielding a network consisting of only 288 weights. The best such network evolved in this study has been evaluated in the online Othello League, obtaining the performance of nearly 96% — more than any other player to date.

input: Despite the remarkable progress recently made in distant speech recognition, state-of-the-art technology still suffers from a lack of robustness, especially when adverse acoustic conditions characterized by non-stationary noises and reverberation are met. A prominent limitation of current systems lies in the lack of matching and communication between the various technologies involved in the distant speech recognition process. The speech enhancement and speech recognition modules are, for instance, often trained independently. Moreover, the speech enhancement normally helps the speech recognizer, but the output of the latter is not commonly used, in turn, to improve the speech enhancement. To address both concerns, we propose a novel architecture based on a network of deep neural networks, where all the components are jointly trained and better cooperate with each other thanks to a full communication scheme between them. Experiments, conducted using different datasets, tasks and acoustic conditions, revealed that the proposed framework can overtake other competitive solutions, including recent joint training approaches.

input: In Computer Vision, problem of identifying or classifying the objects present in an image is called Object Categorization. It is a challenging problem, especially when the images have clutter background, occlusions or different lighting conditions. Many vision features have been proposed which aid object categorization even in such adverse conditions. Past research has shown that, employing multiple features rather than any single features leads to better recognition. Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) framework has been developed for learning an optimal combination of features for object categorization. Existing MKL methods use linear combination of base kernels which may not be optimal for object categorization. Real-world object categorization may need to consider complex combination of kernels(non-linear) and not only linear combination. Evolving non-linear functions of base kernels using Genetic Programming is proposed in this report. Experiment results show that non-kernel generated using genetic programming gives good accuracy as compared to linear combination of kernels.

input: In this work we present a method for using Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) in multi-objective tasks. Deep Q-Networks provide remarkable performance in single objective tasks learning from high-level visual perception. However, in many scenarios (e.g in robotics), the agent needs to pursue multiple objectives simultaneously. We propose an architecture in which separate DQNs are used to control the agent’s behaviour with respect to particular objectives. In this architecture we use signal suppression, known from the (Brooks) subsumption architecture, to combine outputs of several DQNs into a single action. Our architecture enables the decomposition of the agent’s behaviour into controllable and replaceable sub-behaviours learned by distinct modules. To evaluate our solution we used a game-like simulator in which an agent provided with high-level visual input pursues multiple objectives in a 2D world. Our solution provides benefits of modularity, while its performance is comparable to the monolithic approach.

input: Nowadays ontologies present a growing interest in Data Fusion applications. As a matter of fact, the ontologies are seen as a semantic tool for describing and reasoning about sensor data, objects, relations and general domain theories. In addition, uncertainty is perhaps one of the most important characteristics of the data and information handled by Data Fusion. However, the fundamental nature of ontologies implies that ontologies describe only asserted and veracious facts of the world. Different probabilistic, fuzzy and evidential approaches already exist to fill this gap; this paper recaps the most popular tools. However none of the tools meets exactly our purposes. Therefore, we constructed a Dempster-Shafer ontology that can be imported into any specific domain ontology and that enables us to instantiate it in an uncertain manner. We also developed a Java application that enables reasoning about these uncertain ontological instances.

input: Scientists often run experiments to distinguish competing theories. This requires patience, rigor, and ingenuity—there is often a large space of possible experiments one could run. But we need not comb this space by hand—if we represent our theories as formal models and explicitly declare the space of experiments, we can automate the search for good experiments, looking for those with high expected information gain. Here, we present a general and principled approach to experiment design based on probabilistic programming languages (PPLs). PPLs offer a clean separation between declaring problems and solving them, which means that the scientist can automate experiment design by simply declaring her model and experiment spaces in the PPL without having to worry about the details of calculating information gain. We demonstrate our system in two case studies drawn from cognitive psychology, where we use it to design optimal experiments in the domains of sequence prediction and categorization. We find strong empirical validation that our automatically designed experiments were indeed optimal. We conclude by discussing a number of interesting questions for future research.

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

input: Speech analysis had been taken to a new level with the discovery of Reverse Speech (RS). RS is the discovery of hidden messages, referred as reversals, in normal speech. Works are in progress for exploiting the relevance of RS in different real world applications such as investigation, medical field etc. In this paper we represent an innovative method for preparing a reliable Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document with the help of reverse speech. As SRS act as the backbone for the successful completion of any project, a reliable method is needed to overcome the inconsistencies. Using RS such a reliable method for SRS documentation was developed. Keywords— Reverse Speech, Software Requirement Specification (SRS), Speech Enhancement, Speech Recognition.

input: We simulate the training of a set of state of the art neural networks, the Maxout networks (Goodfellow et al., 2013a), on three benchmark datasets: the MNIST, CIFAR10 and SVHN, with three distinct arithmetics: floating point, fixed point and dynamic fixed point. For each of those datasets and for each of those arithmetics, we assess the impact of the precision of the computations on the final error of the training. We find that very low precision computation is sufficient not just for running trained networks but also for training them. For example, almost state-of-the-art results were obtained on most datasets with around 10 bits for computing activations and gradients, and 12 bits for storing updated parameters.

In this work, we attempt to build computational models that can produce witty descriptions for a given image. Inspired by a cognitive account of humor appreciation, we employ linguistic wordplay, specifically puns. We compare our approach against meaningful baseline approaches via human studies.

input: This paper addresses how a recursive neural network model can automatically leave out useless information and emphasize important evidence, in other words, to perform “weight tuning” for higher-level representation acquisition. We propose two models, Weighted Neural Network (WNN) and Binary-Expectation Neural Network (BENN), which automatically control how much one specific unit contributes to the higher-level representation. The proposed model can be viewed as incorporating a more powerful compositional function for embedding acquisition in recursive neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate the significant improvement over standard neural models.

We do this by demonstrating that generalization ability is not controlled by network size but rather by some other implicit control. We then demonstrate how changing the empirical optimization procedure can improve generalization, even if actual optimization quality is not affected. We do so by studying the geometry of the parameter space of deep networks, and devising an optimization algorithm attuned to this geometry.

input: We investigate the pertinence of methods from algebraic topology for text data analysis. These methods enable the development of mathematically-principled isometric-invariant mappings from a set of vectors to a document embedding, which is stable with respect to the geometry of the document in the selected metric space. In this work, we evaluate the utility of these topology-based document representations in traditional NLP tasks, specifically document clustering and sentiment classification. We find that the embeddings do not benefit text analysis. In fact, performance is worse than simple techniques like tf-idf, indicating that the geometry of the document does not provide enough variability for classification on the basis of topic or sentiment in the chosen datasets.

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations.

input: Microarrays are made it possible to simultaneously monitor the expression profiles of thousands of genes under various experimental conditions. It is used to identify the co-expressed genes in specific cells or tissues that are actively used to make proteins. This method is used to analysis the gene expression, an important task in bioinformatics research. Cluster analysis of gene expression data has proved to be a useful tool for identifying co-expressed genes, biologically relevant groupings of genes and samples. In this paper we applied K-Means with Automatic Generations of Merge Factor for ISODATAAGMFI. Though AGMFI has been applied for clustering of Gene Expression Data, this proposed Enhanced Automatic Generations of Merge Factor for ISODATAEAGMFI Algorithms overcome the drawbacks of AGMFI in terms of specifying the optimal number of clusters and initialization of good cluster centroids. Experimental results on Gene Expression Data show that the proposed EAGMFI algorithms could identify compact clusters with perform well in terms of the Silhouette Coefficients cluster measure.

input: In this paper, we present algorithms that perform gradient ascent of the average reward in a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). These algorithms are based on GPOMDP, an algorithm introduced in a companion paper (Baxter & Bartlett, 2001), which computes biased estimates of the performance gradient in POMDPs. The algorithm’s chief advantages are that it uses only one free parameter 2 [0; 1), which has a natural interpretation in terms of bias-variance trade-off, it requires no knowledge of the underlying state, and it can be applied to infinite state, control and observation spaces. We show how the gradient estimates produced by GPOMDP can be used to perform gradient ascent, both with a traditional stochastic-gradient algorithm, and with an algorithm based on conjugate-gradients that utilizes gradient information to bracket maxima in line searches. Experimental results are presented illustrating both the theoretical results of Baxter and Bartlett (2001) on a toy problem, and practical aspects of the algorithms on a number of more realistic problems.

input: Unsupervised models of dependency parsing typically require large amounts of clean, unlabeled data plus gold-standard part-of-speech tags. Adding indirect supervision (e.g. language universals and rules) can help, but we show that obtaining small amounts of direct supervision—here, partial dependency annotations—provides a strong balance between zero and full supervision. We adapt the unsupervised ConvexMST dependency parser to learn from partial dependencies expressed in the Graph Fragment Language. With less than 24 hours of total annotation, we obtain 7% and 17% absolute improvement in unlabeled dependency scores for English and Spanish, respectively, compared to the same parser using only universal grammar constraints.

input: We describe a novel non-parametric statistical hypothesis test of relative dependence between a source variable and two candidate target variables. Such a test enables us to determine whether one source variable is significantly more dependent on a first target variable or a second. Dependence is measured via the HilbertSchmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), resulting in a pair of empirical dependence measures (source-target 1, source-target 2). We test whether the first dependence measure is significantly larger than the second. Modeling the covariance between these HSIC statistics leads to a provably more powerful test than the construction of independent HSIC statistics by subsampling. The resulting test is consistent and unbiased, and (being based on U-statistics) has favorable convergence properties. The test can be computed in quadratic time, matching the computational complexity of standard empirical HSIC estimators. The effectiveness of the test is demonstrated on several real-world problems: we identify language groups from a multilingual corpus, and we prove that tumor location is more dependent on gene expression than chromosomal imbalances.

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

input: Query-based video summarization is the task of creating a brief visual trailer, which captures the parts of the video (or a collection of videos) that are most relevant to the user-issued query. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised label propagation approach for this task. Our approach effectively captures the multimodal semantics of queries and videos using state-of-the-art deep neural networks and creates a summary that is both semantically coherent and visually attractive. We describe the theoretical framework of our graph-based approach and empirically evaluate its effectiveness in creating relevant and attractive trailers. Finally, we showcase example video trailers generated by our system.

input: We consider the hashing mechanism for constructing binary embeddings, that involves pseudo-random projections followed by nonlinear (sign function) mappings. The pseudorandom projection is described by a matrix, where not all entries are independent random variables but instead a fixed “budget of randomness” is distributed across the matrix. Such matrices can be efficiently stored in sub-quadratic or even linear space, provide reduction in randomness usage (i.e. number of required random values), and very often lead to computational speed ups. We prove several theoretical results showing that projections via various structured matrices followed by nonlinear mappings accurately preserve the angular distance between input highdimensional vectors. To the best of our knowledge, these results are the first that give theoretical ground for the use of general structured matrices in the nonlinear setting. In particular, they generalize previous extensions of the JohnsonLindenstrauss lemma and prove the plausibility of the approach that was so far only heuristically confirmed for some special structured matrices. Consequently, we show that many structured matrices can be used as an efficient information compression mechanism. Our findings build a better understanding of certain deep architectures, which contain randomly weighted and untrained layers, and yet achieve high performance on different learning tasks. We empirically verify our theoretical findings and show the dependence of learning via structured hashed projections on the performance of neural network as well as nearest neighbor classifier. Equal contribution.

input: We propose the concept of Action-Related Place (ARPlace) as a powerful and flexible representation of task-related place in the context of mobile manipulation. ARPlace represents robot base locations not as a single position, but rather as a collection of positions, each with an associated probability that the manipulation action will succeed when located there. ARPlaces are generated using a predictive model that is acquired through experience-based learning, and take into account the uncertainty the robot has about its own location and the location of the object to be manipulated. When executing the task, rather than choosing one specific goal position based only on the initial knowledge about the task context, the robot instantiates an ARPlace, and bases its decisions on this ARPlace, which is updated as new information about the task becomes available. To show the advantages of this least-commitment approach, we present a transformational planner that reasons about ARPlaces in order to optimize symbolic plans. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that using ARPlaces leads to more robust and efficient mobile manipulation in the face of state estimation uncertainty on our simulated robot.

input: The paper studies the problem of recovering a spectrally sparse object from a small number of time domain samples. Specifically, the object of interest with ambient dimension n is assumed to be a mixture of r complex multi-dimensional sinusoids, while the underlying frequencies can assume any value in the unit disk. Conventional compressed sensing paradigms suffer from the basis mismatch issue when imposing a discrete dictionary on the Fourier representation. To address this problem, we develop a novel nonparametric algorithm, called enhanced matrix completion (EMaC), based on structured matrix completion. The algorithm starts by arranging the data into a low-rank enhanced form with multi-fold Hankel structure, then attempts recovery via nuclear norm minimization. Under mild incoherence conditions, EMaC allows perfect recovery as soon as the number of samples exceeds the order of O(r log n). We also show that, in many instances, accurate completion of a low-rank multi-fold Hankel matrix is possible when the number of observed entries is proportional to the information theoretical limits (except for a logarithmic gap). The robustness of EMaC against bounded noise and its applicability to super resolution are further demonstrated by numerical experiments.

input: We discuss the problem of construction of inference procedures which can manipulate with uncertainties measured in ordinal scales and fulfil to the property of strict monotonic­ ity of conclusion. The class of A-valuations of plausibility is considered where operations based only on information about linear or­ dering of plausibility values are used. In this class the modus ponens generating function fulfiling to the property of strict monotonic­ ity of conclusions is introduced. 1 STABILITY OF DECISIONS IN INFERENCE PROCEDURES Human judgements about plausibility, truth, certainty values of premises, rules and facts are usually qualita­ tive and measured in ordinal scales. Representation of these judgements by numbers from interval L = [0, lJ or L = [0, 100] and using over these numbers quanti­ tative operations such as multiplication, addition and so on is not always correct. Let's consider example. Let R1 and R2 are two rules of some expert system: Rl: If At then H1,pv(RI), (1) R2: If A2 then H2,pv(R2), (2) where pv(RI) and pv(R2) are the plausibility, cer­ tainty, truth values of rules measured in some linearly ordered scale L, for example L = [0, 1]. Often plausi­ bilities of conclusions are calculated by: pv(Ht) = pv(Rl) * pv(At), (3) pv(H2) = pv(R2) * pv(A2), (4) where pv(At) and pv(A2} are the plausibilities of premises and * is some T-norm, for example multi­ plication operation (Godo, Lopez de Mantaras et al. 1988; Hall1990; Trillas, Valverde 1985; Valverde, Tril­ las 1985; Forsyth 1984). Generally the plausibility of conclusion can be calculated by means of a modus po­ nens generating function mpgf: pv(HI) = mpgf(p·v(At),pv(Rt)). Let in (1)-( 4) the qualitative information about plau­ sibility values is the next: pv(At) < pv(A2} < pv(R2) < pv(RI), (5) that is the plausibility values of premises are less than the plausibility values of rules, the plausibility value of A1 is less than the plausibility value of A2 and the plausibility value of rule R2 is less than the plausibility value of rule Rl. Let these plausibility values are inter­ preted as the next quantitative values from L = (0, 1]: pv(A1) = 0.3 < pv(A2) = 0. 4 < pv(R2} = 0.6 <

We introduce SimVerb-3500, an evaluation resource that provides human ratings for the similarity of 3,500 verb pairs. SimVerb-3500 covers all normed verb types from the USF free-association database, providing at least three examples for every VerbNet class. This broad coverage facilitates detailed analyses of how syntactic and semantic phenomena together influence human understanding of verb meaning. Further, with significantly larger development and test sets than existing benchmarks, SimVerb-3500 enables more robust evaluation of representation learning architectures and promotes the development of methods tailored to verbs. We hope that SimVerb-3500 will enable a richer understanding of the diversity and complexity of verb semantics and guide the development of systems that can effectively represent and interpret this meaning.

Based on a novel and natural definition of weak online learnability, we develop two online boosting algorithms. The first algorithm is an online version of boost-by-majority. By proving a matching lower bound, we show that this algorithm is essentially optimal in terms of the number of weak learners and the sample complexity needed to achieve a specified accuracy. This optimal algorithm is not adaptive, however. Using tools from online loss minimization, we derive an adaptive online boosting algorithm that is also parameter-free, but not optimal. Both algorithms work with base learners that can handle example importance weights directly, as well as by rejection sampling examples with probability defined by the booster. Results are complemented with an experimental study.

This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset.

input: This paper presents the systems developed by LIUM and CVC for the WMT16 Multimodal Machine Translation challenge. We explored various comparative methods, namely phrase-based systems and attentional recurrent neural networks models trained using monomodal or multimodal data. We also performed a human evaluation in order to estimate the usefulness of multimodal data for human machine translation and image description generation. Our systems obtained the best results for both tasks according to the automatic evaluation metrics BLEU and METEOR.

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods.

input: We present a system that produces sentential descriptions of video: who did what to whom, and where and how they did it. Action class is rendered as a verb, participant objects as noun phrases, properties of those objects as adjectival modifiers in those noun phrases, spatial relations between those participants as prepositional phrases, and characteristics of the event as prepositional-phrase adjuncts and adverbial modifiers.

input: Extracting per-frame features using convolutional neural networks for real-time processing of video data is currently mainly performed on powerful GPU-accelerated workstations and compute clusters. However, there are many applications such as smart surveillance cameras that require or would benefit from on-site processing. To this end, we propose and evaluate a novel algorithm for changebased evaluation of CNNs for video data recorded with a static camera setting, exploiting the spatio-temporal sparsity of pixel changes. We achieve an average speed-up of 8.6× over a cuDNN baseline on a realistic benchmark with a negligible accuracy loss of less than 0.1% and no retraining of the network. The resulting energy efficiency is 10× higher than per-frame evaluation and reaches an equivalent of 328GOp/s/W on the Tegra X1 platform.

input: Non-technical losses (NTL) such as electricity theft cause significant harm to our economies, as in some countries they may range up to 40% of the total electricity distributed. Detecting NTLs requires costly on-site inspections. Accurate prediction of NTLs for customers using machine learning is therefore crucial. To date, related research largely ignore that the two classes of regular and non-regular customers are highly imbalanced, that NTL proportions may change and mostly consider small data sets, often not allowing to deploy the results in production. In this paper, we present a comprehensive approach to assess three NTL detection models for different NTL proportions in large real world data sets of 100Ks of customers: Boolean rules, fuzzy logic and Support Vector Machine. This work has resulted in appreciable results that are about to be deployed in a leading industry solution. We believe that the considerations and observations made in this contribution are necessary for future smart meter research in order to report their effectiveness on imbalanced and large real world data sets.

input: We study propagation of the RegularGcc global constraint. This ensures that each row of a matrix of decision variables satisfies a Regular constraint, and each column satisfies a Gcc constraint. On the negative side, we prove that propagation is NP-hard even under some strong restrictions (e.g. just 3 values, just 4 states in the automaton, or just 5 columns to the matrix). On the positive side, we identify two cases where propagation is fixed parameter tractable. In addition, we show how to improve propagation over a simple decomposition into separate Regular and Gcc constraints by identifying some necessary but insufficient conditions for a solution. We enforce these conditions with some additional weighted row automata. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of these methods on some standard benchmark problems.

input: In neural machine translation (NMT), generation of a target word depends on both source and target contexts. We find that source contexts have a direct impact on the adequacy of a translation while target contexts on the fluency. Intuitively, generation of a content word should rely more on the source context and generation of a functional word should rely more on the target context. Due to lack of effective control on the influence from source and target contexts, conventional NMT tends to yield fluent but inadequate translations. To address this problem, we propose to use context gates to dynamically control the ratios at which source and target contexts contribute to the generation of target words. In this way, we can enhance the adequacy of NMT while keeping the fluency unchanged. Experiments show that our approach significantly improves upon a standard attention-based NMT system by +2.3 BLEU points.

input: Most conventional sentence similarity methods only focus on similar parts of two input sentences, and simply ignore the dissimilar parts, which usually give us some clues and semantic meanings about the sentences. In this work, we propose a model to take into account both the similarities and dissimilarities by decomposing and composing lexical semantics over sentences. The model represents each word as a vector, and calculates a semantic matching vector for each word based on all words in the other sentence. Then, each word vector is decomposed into a similar component and a dissimilar component based on the semantic matching vector. After this, a twochannel CNN model is employed to capture features by composing the similar and dissimilar components. Finally, a similarity score is estimated over the composed feature vectors. Experimental results show that our model gets the state-of-the-art performance on the answer sentence selection task, and achieves a comparable result on the paraphrase identification task.

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

input: To model time-varying nonlinear temporal dynamics in sequential data, a recurrent network capable of varying and adjusting the recurrence depth between input intervals is examined. The recurrence depth is extended by several intermediate hidden state units, and the weight parameters involved in determining these units are dynamically calculated. The motivation behind the paper lies on overcoming a deficiency in Recurrent Highway Networks and improving their performances which are currently at the forefront of RNNs: 1) Determining the appropriate number of recurrent depth in RHN for different tasks is a huge burden and just setting it to a large number is computationally wasteful with possible repercussion in terms of performance degradation and high latency. Expanding on the idea of adaptive computation time (ACT), with the use of an elastic gate in the form of a rectified exponentially decreasing function taking on as arguments as previous hidden state and input, the proposed model is able to evaluate the appropriate recurrent depth for each input. The rectified gating function enables the most significant intermediate hidden state updates to come early such that significant performance gain is achieved early. 2) Updating the weights from that of previous intermediate layer offers a richer representation than the use of shared weights across all intermediate recurrence layers. The weight update procedure is just an expansion of the idea underlying hypernetworks. To substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed network, we conducted three experiments: regression on synthetic data, human activity recognition, and language modeling on the Penn Treebank dataset. The proposed networks showed better performance than other state-of-theart recurrent networks in all three experiments.

input: The zero-shot paradigm exploits vector-based word representations extracted from text corpora with unsupervised methods to learn general mapping functions from other feature spaces onto word space, where the words associated to the nearest neighbours of the mapped vectors are used as their linguistic labels. We show that the neighbourhoods of the mapped elements are strongly polluted by hubs, vectors that tend to be near a high proportion of items, pushing their correct labels down the neighbour list. After illustrating the problem empirically, we propose a simple method to correct it by taking the proximity distribution of potential neighbours across many mapped vectors into account. We show that this correction leads to consistent improvements in realistic zero-shot experiments in the cross-lingual, image labeling and image retrieval domains.

input: We consider a transfer-learning problem by using the parameter transfer approach, where a suitable parameter of feature mapping is learned through one task and applied to another objective task. Then, we introduce the notion of the local stability of parametric feature mapping and parameter transfer learnability, and thereby derive a learning bound for parameter transfer algorithms. As an application of parameter transfer learning, we discuss the performance of sparse coding in selftaught learning. Although self-taught learning algorithms with plentiful unlabeled data often show excellent empirical performance, their theoretical analysis has not been studied. In this paper, we also provide the first theoretical learning bound for self-taught learning.

input: Information discounting plays an important role in the theory of belief functions and, generally, in information fusion. Nevertheless, neither classical uniform discounting nor contextual cannot model certain use cases, notably temporal discounting. In this article, new contextual discounting schemes, conservative, proportional and optimistic, are proposed. Some properties of these discounting operations are examined. Classical discounting is shown to be a special case of these schemes. Two motivating cases are discussed: modelling of source reliability and application to temporal discounting.

input: Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNN) are vulnerable to adversarial samples: maliciously-perturbed samples crafted to yield incorrect model outputs. Such attacks can severely undermine DNN systems, particularly in security-sensitive settings. It was observed that an adversary could easily generate adversarial samples by making a small perturbation on irrelevant feature dimensions that are unnecessary for the current classification task. To overcome this problem, we introduce a defensive mechanism called DeepMask. By identifying and removing unnecessary features in a DNN model, DeepMask limits the capacity an attacker can use generating adversarial samples and therefore increase the robustness against such inputs. Comparing with other defensive approaches, DeepMask is easy to implement and computationally efficient. Experimental results show that DeepMask can increase the performance of state-of-the-art DNN models against adversarial samples.

In this work, we show that this formulation subsumes the standard formulation of Plan Recognition over libraries through a compilation of libraries into STRIPS theories. The libraries correspond to AND/OR graphs that may be cyclic and where children of AND nodes may be partially ordered. These libraries include Context-Free Grammars as a special case, where the Plan Recognition problem becomes a parsing with missing tokens problem. Plan Recognition over the standard libraries become Planning problems that can be easily solved by any modern planner, while recognition over more complex libraries, including Context–Free Grammars (CFGs), illustrate limitations of current Planning heuristics and suggest improvements that may be relevant in other Planning problems too.

But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset.

input: Recent research on deep neural networks has focused primarily on improving accuracy. For a given accuracy level, is typically possible to identify multiple DNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent accuracy, smaller DNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1) Smaller DNNs require less communication across servers during distributed training. (2) Smaller DNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller DNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these advantages, we propose a small DNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet achieves AlexNetlevel accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. Additionally, with model compression techniques we are able to compress SqueezeNet to less than 1MB (461x smaller than AlexNet). The SqueezeNet architecture is available for download here: https://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet

input: Continuous-time Bayesian networks is a natural structured representation language for multicomponent stochastic processes that evolve continuously over time. Despite the compact representation, inference in such models is intractable even in relatively simple structured networks. Here we introduce a mean field variational approximation in which we use a product of inhomogeneous Markov processes to approximate a distribution over trajectories. This variational approach leads to a globally consistent distribution, which can be efficiently queried. Additionally, it provides a lower bound on the probability of observations, thus making it attractive for learning tasks. We provide the theoretical foundations for the approximation, an efficient implementation that exploits the wide range of highly optimized ordinary differential equations (ODE) solvers, experimentally explore characterizations of processes for which this approximation is suitable, and show applications to a large-scale realworld inference problem.

Now complete the following example-
input: Recurrent neural network (RNN) based character-level language models (CLMs) are extremely useful for modeling unseen words by nature. However, their performance is generally much worse than the word-level language models (WLMs), since CLMs need to consider longer history of tokens to properly predict the next one. We address this problem by proposing hierarchical RNN architectures, which consist of multiple modules with different clock rates. Despite the multiclock structures, the input and output layers operate with the character-level clock, which allows the existing RNN CLM training approaches to be directly applicable without any modifications. Our CLM models show better perplexity than KneserNey (KN) 5-gram WLMs on the One Billion Word Benchmark with only 2% of parameters. Also, we present real-time character-level end-to-end speech recognition examples on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus, where replacing traditional mono-clock RNN CLMs with the proposed models results in better recognition accuracies even though the number of parameters are reduced to 30%.

input: With ever-increasing computational demand for deep learning, it is critical to investigate the implications of the numeric representation and precision of DNN model weights and activations on computational efficiency. In this work, we explore unconventional narrow-precision floating-point representations as it relates to inference accuracy and efficiency to steer the improved design of future DNN platforms. We show that inference using these custom numeric representations on production-grade DNNs, including GoogLeNet and VGG, achieves an average speedup of 7.6× with less than 1% degradation in inference accuracy relative to a state-of-the-art baseline platform representing the most sophisticated hardware using single-precision floating point. To facilitate the use of such customized precision, we also present a novel technique that drastically reduces the time required to derive the optimal precision configuration.

input: We describe a dynamic programming algorithm for computing the marginal distribution of discrete probabilistic programs. This algorithm takes a functional interpreter for an arbitrary probabilistic programming language and turns it into an efficient marginalizer. Because direct caching of sub-distributions is impossible in the presence of recursion, we build a graph of dependencies between sub-distributions. This factored sum-product network makes (potentially cyclic) dependencies between subproblems explicit, and corresponds to a system of equations for the marginal distribution. We solve these equations by fixed-point iteration in topological order. We illustrate this algorithm on examples used in teaching probabilistic models, computational cognitive science research, and game theory.

A central notion in this setting is that of an ontology-mediated query, which is a database query coupled with an ontology. In this paper, we study several classes of ontology-mediated queries, where the database queries are given as some form of conjunctive query and the ontologies are formulated in description logics or other relevant fragments of first-order logic, such as the guarded fragment and the unary-negation fragment. The contributions of the paper are three-fold. First, we characterize the expressive power of ontology-mediated queries in terms of fragments of disjunctive datalog. Second, we establish intimate connections between ontology-mediated queries and constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and their logical generalization, MMSNP formulas. Third, we exploit these connections to obtain new results regarding (i) first-order rewritability and datalogrewritability of ontology-mediated queries, (ii) P/NP dichotomies for ontology-mediated queries, and (iii) the query containment problem for ontology-mediated queries.

input: People can recognize scenes across many different modalities beyond natural images. In this paper, we investigate how to learn cross-modal scene representations that transfer across modalities. To study this problem, we introduce a new cross-modal scene dataset. While convolutional neural networks can categorize scenes well, they also learn an intermediate representation not aligned across modalities, which is undesirable for cross-modal transfer applications. We present methods to regularize cross-modal convolutional neural networks so that they have a shared representation that is agnostic of the modality. Our experiments suggest that our scene representation can help transfer representations across modalities for retrieval. Moreover, our visualizations suggest that units emerge in the shared representation that tend to activate on consistent concepts independently of the modality.

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods.

input: The paper analyzes the interaction between humans and computers in terms of response time in solving the image-based CAPTCHA. In particular, the analysis focuses on the attitude of the different Internet users in easily solving four different types of image-based CAPTCHAs which include facial expressions like: animated character, old woman, surprised face, worried face. To pursue this goal, an experiment is realized involving 100 Internet users in solving the four types of CAPTCHAs, differentiated by age, Internet experience, and education level. The response times are collected for each user. Then, association rules are extracted from user data, for evaluating the dependence of the response time in solving the CAPTCHA from age, education level and experience in internet usage by statistical analysis. The results implicitly capture the users’ psychological states showing in what states the users are more sensible. It reveals to be a novelty and a meaningful analysis in the state-of-the-art.

input: The introduction of loopy belief propagation (LBP) revitalized the application of graphical models in many domains. Many recent works present improvements on the basic LBP algorithm in an attempt to overcome convergence and local optima problems. Notable among these are convexified free energy approximations that lead to inference procedures with provable convergence and quality properties. However, empirically LBP still outperforms most of its convex variants in a variety of settings, as we also demonstrate here. Motivated by this fact we seek convexified free energies that directly approximate the Bethe free energy. We show that the proposed approximations compare favorably with state-of-the art convex free energy approximations.

input: We show that the herding procedure of Welling (2009b) takes exactly the form of a standard convex optimization algorithm— namely a conditional gradient algorithm minimizing a quadratic moment discrepancy. This link enables us to invoke convergence results from convex optimization and to consider faster alternatives for the task of approximating integrals in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We study the behavior of the different variants through numerical simulations. Our experiments shed more light on the learning bias of herding: they indicate that while we can improve over herding on the task of approximating integrals, the original herding algorithm approaches more often the maximum entropy distribution.

input: One of the key issues in both natural language understanding and generation is the appropriate processing of Multiword Expressions (MWEs). MWEs pose a huge problem to the precise language processing due to their idiosyncratic nature and diversity in lexical, syntactical and semantic properties. The semantics of a MWE cannot be expressed after combining the semantics of its constituents. Therefore, the formalism of semantic clustering is often viewed as an instrument for extracting MWEs especially for resource constraint languages like Bengali. The present semantic clustering approach contributes to locate clusters of the synonymous noun tokens present in the document. These clusters in turn help measure the similarity between the constituent words of a potentially candidate phrase using a vector space model and judge the suitability of this phrase to be a MWE. In this experiment, we apply the semantic clustering approach for nounnoun bigram MWEs, though it can be extended to any types of MWEs. In parallel, the well known statistical models, namely Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI), Log Likelihood Ratio (LLR), Significance function are also employed to extract MWEs from the Bengali corpus. The comparative evaluation shows that the 372 Chakraborty et al. semantic clustering approach outperforms all other competing statistical models. As a byproduct of this experiment, we have started developing a standard lexicon in Bengali that serves as a productive Bengali linguistic thesaurus.

input: Agents of general intelligence deployed in real-world scenarios must adapt to ever-changing environmental conditions. While such adaptive agents may leverage engineered knowledge, they will require the capacity to construct and evaluate knowledge themselves from their own experience in a bottom-up, constructivist fashion. This position paper builds on the idea of encoding knowledge as temporally extended predictions through the use of general value functions. Prior work has focused on learning predictions about externally derived signals about a task or environment (e.g. battery level, joint position). Here we advocate that the agent should also predict internally generated signals regarding its own learning process—for example, an agent’s confidence in its learned predictions. Finally, we suggest how such information would be beneficial in creating an introspective agent that is able to learn to make good decisions in a complex, changing world. Predictive Knowledge. The ability to autonomously construct knowledge directly from experience produced by an agent interacting with the world is a key requirement for general intelligence. One particularly promising form of knowledge that is grounded in experience is predictive knowledge—here defined as a collection of multi-step predictions about observable outcomes that are contingent on different ways of behaving. Much like scientific knowledge, predictive knowledge can be maintained and updated by making a prediction, executing a procedure, and observing the outcome and updating the prediction—a process completely independent of human intervention. Experience-grounded predictions are a powerful resource to guide decision making in environments which are too complex or dynamic to be exhaustively anticipated by an engineer [1,2]. A value function from the field of reinforcement learning is one way of representing predictive knowledge. Value functions are a learned or computed mapping from state to the long-term expectation of future reward. Sutton et al. recently introduced a generalization of value functions that makes it possible to specify general predictive questions [1]. These general value functions (GVFs), specify a prediction target as the expected discounted sum of future signals of interest (cumulants) observed while the agent selects actions according to some decision making policy. Temporal discounting is also generalized in GVFs from the conventional exponential weighting of future cumulants to an arbitrary, stateconditional weighting of future cumulants. This enables GVFs to specify a rich ar X iv :1 60 6. 05 59 3v 1 [ cs .A I] 1 7 Ju n 20 16

input: Development of a proper names pronunciation lexicon is usually a manual effort which can not be avoided. Grapheme to phoneme (G2P) conversion modules, in literature, are usually rule based and work best for non-proper names in a particular language. Proper names are foreign to a G2P module. We follow an optimization approach to enable automatic construction of proper names pronunciation lexicon. The idea is to construct a small orthogonal set of words (basis) which can span the set of names in a given database. We propose two algorithms for the construction of this basis. The transcription lexicon of all the proper names in a database can be produced by the manual transcription of only the small set of basis words. We first construct a cost function and show that the minimization of the cost function results in a basis. We derive conditions for convergence of this cost function and validate them experimentally on a very large proper name database. Experiments show the transcription can be achieved by transcribing a set of small number of basis words. The algorithms proposed are generic and independent of language; however performance is better if the proper names have same origin, namely, same language or geographical region.

input: Type-level word embeddings use the same set of parameters to represent all instances of a word regardless of its context, ignoring the inherent lexical ambiguity in language. Instead, we embed semantic concepts (or synsets) as defined in WordNet and represent a word token in a particular context by estimating a distribution over relevant semantic concepts. We use the new, context-sensitive embeddings in a model for predicting prepositional phrase (PP) attachments and jointly learn the concept embeddings and model parameters. We show that using context-sensitive embeddings improves the accuracy of the PP attachment model by 5.4% absolute points, which amounts to a 34.4% relative reduction in errors.

input: We publicly release a new large-scale dataset, called SearchQA, for machine comprehension, or question-answering. Unlike recently released datasets, such as DeepMind CNN/DailyMail and SQuAD, the proposed SearchQA was constructed to reflect a full pipeline of general question-answering. That is, we start not from an existing article and generate a question-answer pair, but start from an existing question-answer pair, crawled from J! Archive, and augment it with text snippets retrieved by Google. Following this approach, we built SearchQA, which consists of more than 140k question-answer pairs with each pair having 49.6 snippets on average. Each question-answer-context tuple of the SearchQA comes with additional meta-data such as the snippet’s URL, which we believe will be valuable resources for future research. We conduct human evaluation as well as test two baseline methods, one simple word selection and the other deep learning based, on the SearchQA. We show that there is a meaningful gap between the human and machine performances. This suggests that the proposed dataset could well serve as a benchmark for question-answering.

input: We introduce a new multi-modal task for computer systems, posed as a combined vision-language comprehension challenge: identifying the most suitable text describing a scene, given several similar options. Accomplishing the task entails demonstrating comprehension beyond just recognizing “keywords” (or key-phrases) and their corresponding visual concepts. Instead, it requires an alignment between the representations of the two modalities that achieves a visually-grounded “understanding” of various linguistic elements and their dependencies. This new task also admits an easy-to-compute and wellstudied metric: the accuracy in detecting the true target among the decoys. The paper makes several contributions: an effective and extensible mechanism for generating decoys from (human-created) image captions; an instance of applying this mechanism, yielding a large-scale machine comprehension dataset (based on the COCO images and captions) that we make publicly available; human evaluation results on this dataset, informing a performance upper-bound; and several baseline and competitive learning approaches that illustrate the utility of the proposed task and dataset in advancing both image and language comprehension. We also show that, in a multi-task learning setting, the performance on the proposed task is positively correlated with the end-to-end task of image captioning.

input: We envision a machine learning service provider facing a continuous stream of problems with the same input domain, but with output domains that may differ. Clients present the provider with problems implicitly, by labeling a few example inputs, and then ask the provider to train models which reasonably extend their labelings to novel inputs. The provider wants to avoid constraining its users to a set of common labels, so it does not assume any particular correspondence between labels for a new task and labels for previously encountered tasks. To perform well in this setting, the provider needs a representation of the input domain which, in expectation, permits effective models for new problems to be learned efficiently from a small number of examples. While this bears a resemblance to settings considered in previous work on multitask and lifelong learning, our non-assumption of inter-task label correspondence leads to a novel algorithm: Lifelong Learner of Discriminative Representations (LLDR), which explicitly minimizes a proxy for the intra-task small-sample generalization error. We examine the relative benefits of our approach on a diverse set of real-world datasets in three significant scenarios: representation learning, multitask learning and lifelong learning.

input: The Rao-Blackwell theorem is utilized to analyze and improve the scalability of inference in large probabilistic models that exhibit symmetries. A novel marginal density estimator is introduced and shown both analytically and empirically to outperform standard estimators by several orders of magnitude. The developed theory and algorithms apply to a broad class of probabilistic models including statistical relational models considered not susceptible to lifted probabilistic inference. Introduction Many successful applications of artificial intelligence research are based on large probabilistic models. Examples include Markov logic networks (Richardson and Domingos 2006), conditional random fields (Lafferty, McCallum, and Pereira 2001) and, more recently, deep learning architectures (Hinton, Osindero, and Teh 2006; Bengio and LeCun 2007; Poon and Domingos 2011). Especially the models one encounters in the statistical relational learning (SRL) literature often have joint distributions spanning millions of variables and features. Indeed, these models are so large that, at first sight, inference and learning seem daunting. For numerous of these models, however, scalable approximate and, to a lesser extend, exact inference algorithms do exist. Most notably, there has been a strong focus on lifted inference algorithms, that is, algorithms that group indistinguishable variables and features during inference. For an overview we refer the reader to (Kersting 2012). Lifted algorithms facilitate efficient inference in numerous large probabilistic models for which inference is NP-hard in principle. We are concerned with the estimation of marginal probabilities based on a finite number of sample points. We show that the feasibility of inference and learning in large and highly symmetric probabilistic models can be explained with the Rao-Blackwell theorem from the field of statistics. The theory and algorithms do not directly depend on the syntactical nature of the relational models such as arity of predicates and number of variables per formula but only on the given automorphism group of the probabilistic model, and are applicable to classes of probabilistic models much broader than the class of statistical relational models.

While a frequentist would assume the flips to be i.i.d., a Bayesian typically makes the weaker assumption of exchangeability – that the probability of an outcome sequence only depends on the number of “heads” in the sequence and not on their order. Under the non-i.i.d. assumption, a possible corresponding graphical model is the fully connected graph with n nodes and high treewidth. The actual number of parameters required to specify the distribution, however, is only n+1, one for each sequence with 0 ≤ k ≤ n “heads.” Bruno de Finetti was the first to realize that such a sequence of random variables can be (re-)parameterized as a unique mixture of n+1 independent urn processes (de Finetti 1938). It is this notion of a parameterization as a mixture of urn processes that is at the heart of our work. A direct application of de Finetti’s results, however, is often impossible since not all variables are exchangeable in realistic probabilistic models. Motivated by the intuition of exchangeability, we show that arbitrary model symmetries allow us to re-paramterize the distribution as a mixture of independent urn processes where each urn consists of isomorphic joint assignments. Most importantly, we develop a novel Rao-Blackwellized estimator that implicitly estimates the fewer parameters of the simpler mixture model and, based on these, computes the marginal densities. We identify situations in which the application of the Rao-Blackwell estimator is tractable. In particular, we show that the Rao-Blackwell estimator is always linear-time computable for single-variable marginal density estimation. By invoking the Rao-Blackwell theorem, we show that the mean squared error of the novel estimator is at least as small as that of the standard estimator and strictly smaller under non-trivial symmetries of the probabilistic model. Moreover, we prove that for estimates based on sample points drawn from a Markov chainM, the bias of the Rao-Blackwell estimator is governed by the mixing time of the quotient Markov chain whose convergence behavior is superior to that ofM. We present empirical results verifying that the RaoBlackwell estimator always outperforms the standard estimator by up to several orders of magnitude, irrespective of the model structure. Indeed, we show that the results of the novel estimator resemble those typically observed in lifted inference papers. For the first time such a performance is shown for an SRL model with a transitivity formula. ar X iv :1 30 4. 26 94 v1 [ cs .A I] 9 A pr 2 01 3

input: In classical machine learning, regression is treated as a black box process of identifying a suitable function from a hypothesis set without attempting to gain insight into the mechanism connecting inputs and outputs. In the natural sciences, however, finding an interpretable function for a phenomenon is the prime goal as it allows to understand and generalize results. This paper proposes a novel type of function learning network, called equation learner (EQL), that can learn analytical expressions and is able to extrapolate to unseen domains. It is implemented as an end-to-end differentiable feed-forward network and allows for efficient gradient based training. Due to sparsity regularization concise interpretable expressions can be obtained. Often the true underlying source expression is identified. INTRODUCTION The quality of a model is typically measured by its ability to generalize from a training set to previously unseen data from the same distribution. In regression tasks generalization essentially boils down to interpolation if the training data is sufficiently dense. As long as models are selected correctly, i. e. in a way to not overfit the data, the regression problem is well understood and can – at least conceptually – be considered solved. However, when working with data from real-world devices, e. g. controlling a robotic arm, interpolation might not be sufficient. It could happen that future data lies outside of the training domain, e. g. when the arm is temporarily operated outside of its specifications. For the sake of robustness and safety it is desirable in such a case to have a regression model that continues to make good predictions, or at least does not fail catastrophically. This setting, which we call extrapolation generalization, is the topic of the present paper. We are particularly interested in regression tasks for systems that can be described by real-valued analytic expression, e. g. mechanical systems such as a pendulum or a robotic arm. These are typically governed by a highly nonlinear function but it is nevertheless possible, in principle, to infer their behavior on an extrapolation domain from their behavior elsewhere. We make two main contributions: 1) a new type of network that can learn analytical expressions and is able to extrapolate to unseen domains and 2) a model selection strategy tailored to the extrapolation setting. The following section describes the setting of regression and extrapolation. Afterwards we introduce our method and discuss the architecture, its training, and its relation to prior art. We present our results in the Section Experimental evaluation and close with conclusions. REGRESSION AND EXTRAPOLATION We consider a multivariate regression problem with a training set {(x1, y1), . . . , (xN , yN )} with x ∈ R, y ∈ R. Because our main interest lies on extrapolation in the context of learning the dynamics of physical systems we assume the data originates from an unknown analytical function (or system of functions), φ : R → R with additive zero-mean noise, ξ, i. e. y = φ(x) + ξ and Eξ = 0. The function φ may, for instance, reflect a system of ordinary differential equations that govern the movements of a robot arm or the like. The general task is to learn a function ψ : R → R that approximates the true functional relation as well as possible in the squared loss sense, i. e. achieves minimal expected error E‖ψ(x) − φ(x)‖2. In practice, we only have particular examples of the function values available and measure the quality of predicting in terms of the empirical error on

Three swarm-based algorithms have been applied in conjunction with normal-boundary intersection (NBI) method to solve this MO problem. The gravitational search algorithm (GSA) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique were implemented in this work. In addition, a novel Hopfield-enhanced particle swarm optimization was developed and applied to the extraction problem. By measuring the levels of dominance, the optimality of the approximate Pareto frontiers produced by all the algorithms were gauged and compared. Besides, by measuring the levels of convergence of the frontier, some understanding regarding the structure of the objective space in terms of its relation to the level of frontier dominance is uncovered.

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

input: Rare diseases are very difficult to identify among large number of other possible diagnoses. Better availability of patient data and improvement in machine learning algorithms empower us to tackle this problem computationally. In this paper, we target one such rare disease – cardiac amyloidosis. We aim to automate the process of identifying potential cardiac amyloidosis patients with the help of machine learning algorithms and also learn most predictive factors. With the help of experienced cardiologists, we prepared a gold standard with 73 positive (cardiac amyloidosis) and 197 negative instances. We achieved high average cross-validation F1 score of 0.98 using an ensemble machine learning classifier. Some of the predictive variables were: Age and Diagnosis of cardiac arrest, chest pain, congestive heart failure, hypertension, prim open angle glaucoma, and shoulder arthritis. Further studies are needed to validate the accuracy of the system across an entire health system and its generalizability for other diseases.

input: Reasoning and inference are central to human and artificial intelligence. Modeling inference in human language is very challenging. With the availability of large annotated data (Bowman et al., 2015), it has recently become feasible to train neural network based inference models, which have shown to be very effective. In this paper, we present a new state-of-the-art result, achieving the accuracy of 88.6% on the Stanford natural language inference dataset. Unlike the previous top models that use very complicated network architectures, we first demonstrate that carefully designing sequential inference models based on chain LSTMs can outperform all previous models. Based on this, we further show that by explicitly considering recursive architectures in both local inference modeling and inference composition, we achieve additional improvement. Particularly, incorporating syntactic parsing information contributes to our best result—it further improves the performance even when added to the already very strong model.

input: Kinect skeleton tracker is able to achieve considerable human body tracking performance in convenient and a low-cost manner. However, The tracker often captures unnatural human poses such as discontinuous and vibrated motions when self-occlusions occur. A majority of approaches tackle this problem by using multiple Kinect sensors in a workspace. Combination of the measurements from different sensors is then conducted in Kalman filter framework or optimization problem is formulated for sensor fusion. However, these methods usually require heuristics to measure reliability of measurements observed from each Kinect sensor. In this paper, we developed a method to improve Kinect skeleton using single Kinect sensor, in which supervised learning technique was employed to correct unnatural tracking motions. Specifically, deep recurrent neural networks were used for improving joint positions and velocities of Kinect skeleton, and three methods were proposed to integrate the refined positions and velocities for further enhancement. Moreover, we suggested a novel measure to evaluate naturalness of captured motions. We evaluated the proposed approach by comparison with the ground truth obtained using a commercial optical maker-based motion capture system.

input: We consider the problem of sparse variable selection in nonparametric additive models, with the prior knowledge of the structure among the covariates to encourage those variables within a group to be selected jointly. Previous works either study the group sparsity in the parametric setting (e.g., group lasso), or address the problem in the nonparametric setting without exploiting the structural information (e.g., sparse additive models). In this paper, we present a new method, called group sparse additive models (GroupSpAM), which can handle group sparsity in additive models. We generalize the `1/`2 norm to Hilbert spaces as the sparsityinducing penalty in GroupSpAM. Moreover, we derive a novel thresholding condition for identifying the functional sparsity at the group level, and propose an efficient block coordinate descent algorithm for constructing the estimate. We demonstrate by simulation that GroupSpAM substantially outperforms the competing methods in terms of support recovery and prediction accuracy in additive models, and also conduct a comparative experiment on a real breast cancer dataset.

Machine comprehension benchmarks evaluate the system’s ability to understand text based on the text content only. In this work, we investigate machine comprehension on MCTest, a question answering (QA) benchmark. Prior work is mainly based on feature engineering approaches. We come up with a neural network framework, named hierarchical attention-based convolutional neural network (HABCNN), to address this task without any manually designed features. Specifically, we explore HABCNN for this task by two routes, one is through traditional joint modeling of document, question and answer, one is through textual entailment. HABCNN employs an attention mechanism to detect key phrases, key sentences and key snippets that are relevant to answering the question. Experiments show that HABCNN outperforms prior deep learning approaches by a big margin.

input: Model interpretation is one of the key aspects of the model evaluation process. The explanation of the relationship between model variables and outputs is relatively easy for statistical models, such as linear regressions, thanks to the availability of model parameters and their statistical significance. For “black box” models, such as random forest, this information is hidden inside the model structure. This work presents an approach for computing feature contributions for random forest classification models. It allows for the determination of the influence of each variable on the model prediction for an individual instance. By analysing feature contributions for a training dataset, the most significant variables can be determined and their typical contribution towards predictions made for individual classes, i.e., class-specific feature contribution ”patterns”, are discovered. These patterns represent a standard behaviour of the model and allow for an additional assessment of the model reliability for a new data. Interpretation of feature contributions for two UCI benchmark datasets shows the potential of the proposed methodology. The robustness of results is demonstrated through an extensive analysis of feature contributions calculated for a large number of generated random forest models. ∗a.m.wojak@bradford.ac.uk †j.palczewski@leeds.ac.uk ‡r.l.marcheserobinson@ljmu.ac.uk §d.neagu@bradford.ac.uk 1 ar X iv :1 31 2. 11 21 v1 [ cs .L G ] 4 D ec 2 01 3

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

The CNN tagger is robust across different tagging tasks: without task-specific tuning of hyper-parameters, it achieves state-of-theart results in part-of-speech tagging, morphological tagging and supertagging. The CNN tagger is also robust against the outof-vocabulary problem, it performs well on artificially unnormalized texts.

input: In this paper we examine the benefit of performing named entity recognition (NER) and co-reference resolution to an English and a Greek corpus used for text segmentation. The aim here is to examine whether the combination of text segmentation and information extraction can be beneficial for the identification of the various topics that appear in a document. NER was performed manually in the English corpus and was compared with the output produced by publicly available annotation tools while, an already existing tool was used for the Greek corpus. Produced annotations from both corpora were manually corrected and enriched to cover four types of named entities. Co-reference resolution i.e., substitution of every reference of the same instance with the same named entity identifier was subsequently performed. The evaluation, using five text segmentation algorithms for the English corpus and four for the Greek corpus leads to the conclusion that, the benefit highly depends on the segment’s topic, the number of named entity instances appearing in it, as well as the segment’s length.

We further demonstrate how the acquired design knowledge can be used to generate sections of game levels.

We show how rich game design information can be automatically parsed from gameplay videos and represented as a set of generative probabilistic models. We use Super Mario Bros. as a proof of concept.

input: Recently, bidirectional recurrent network language models (biRNNLMs) have been shown to outperform standard, unidirectional, recurrent neural network language models (uni-RNNLMs) on a range of speech recognition tasks. This indicates that future word context information beyond the word history can be useful. However, bi-RNNLMs pose a number of challenges as they make use of the complete previous and future word context information. This impacts both training efficiency and their use within a lattice rescoring framework. In this paper these issues are addressed by proposing a novel neural network structure, succeeding word RNNLMs (suRNNLMs). Instead of using a recurrent unit to capture the complete future word contexts, a feedforward unit is used to model a finite number of succeeding, future, words. This model can be trained much more efficiently than bi-RNNLMs and can also be used for lattice rescoring. Experimental results on a meeting transcription task (AMI) show the proposed model consistently outperformed uni-RNNLMs and yield only a slight degradation compared to bi-RNNLMs in N-best rescoring. Additionally, performance improvements can be obtained using lattice rescoring and subsequent confusion network decoding.

input: In the last two decades, modal and description logics have been applied to numerous areas of computer science, including knowledge representation, formal verification, database theory, distributed computing and, more recently, semantic web and ontologies. For this reason, the problem of automated reasoning in modal and description logics has been thoroughly investigated. In particular, many approaches have been proposed for efficiently handling the satisfiability of the core normal modal logic Km, and of its notational variant, the description logic ALC. Although simple in structure, Km/ALC is computationally very hard to reason on, its satisfiability being PSpace-complete. In this paper we start exploring the idea of performing automated reasoning tasks in modal and description logics by encoding them into SAT, so that to be handled by stateof-the-art SAT tools; as with most previous approaches, we begin our investigation from the satisfiability in Km. We propose an efficient encoding, and we test it on an extensive set of benchmarks, comparing the approach with the main state-of-the-art tools available. Although the encoding is necessarily worst-case exponential, from our experiments we notice that, in practice, this approach can handle most or all the problems which are at the reach of the other approaches, with performances which are comparable with, or even better than, those of the current state-of-the-art tools. 1. Motivations and Goals In the last two decades, modal and description logics have provided an essential framework for many applications in numerous areas of computer science, including artificial intelligence, formal verification, database theory, distributed computing and, more recently, semantic web and ontologies. For this reason, the problem of automated reasoning in modal and description logics has been thoroughly investigated (e.g., Fitting, 1983; Ladner, 1977; Baader & Hollunder, 1991; Halpern & Moses, 1992; Baader, Franconi, Hollunder, Nebel, & Profitlich, 1994; Massacci, 2000). In particular, the research in modal and description logics has followed two parallel routes until the seminal work of Schild (1991), which proved that the core modal logic Km and the core description logic ALC are one a notational variant of the other. Since then, analogous results have been produced for a bunch of other logics, so that, nowadays the two research lines have mostly merged into one research flow. Many approaches have been proposed for efficiently reasoning in modal and description logics, starting from the problem of checking the satisfiability in the core normal modal logic Km and in its notational variant, the description logic ALC (hereafter simply “Km”). We classify them as follows. c ©2009 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved. Sebastiani & Vescovi • The “classic” tableau-based approach (Fitting, 1983; Baader & Hollunder, 1991; Massacci, 2000) is based on the construction of propositional tableau branches, which are recursively expanded on demand by generating successor nodes in a candidate Kripke model. Kris (Baader & Hollunder, 1991; Baader et al., 1994), Crack (Franconi, 1998), LWB (Balsiger, Heuerding, & Schwendimann, 1998) were among the main representative tools of this approach. • The DPLL-based approach (Giunchiglia & Sebastiani, 1996, 2000) differs from the previous one mostly in the fact that a Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) procedure, which treats the modal subformulas as propositions, is used instead of the classic propositional tableaux procedure at each nesting level of the modal operators. KSAT (Giunchiglia & Sebastiani, 1996), ESAT (Giunchiglia, Giunchiglia, & Tacchella, 2002) and *SAT (Tacchella, 1999), are the representative tools of this approach. These two approaches merged into the “modern” tableaux-based approach, which has been extended to work with more expressive description logics and to provide more sophisticate reasoning functions. Among the tools employing this approach, we recall FaCT/FaCT++ and DLP (Horrocks & Patel-Schneider, 1999), and Racer (Haarslev & Moeller, 2001). 1 • In the translational approach (Hustadt & Schmidt, 1999; Areces, Gennari, Heguiabehere, & de Rijke, 2000) the modal formula is encoded into first-order logic (FOL), and the encoded formula can be decided efficiently by a FOL theorem prover (Areces et al., 2000). Mspass (Hustadt, Schmidt, & Weidenbach, 1999) is the most representative tool of this approach. • The CSP-based approach (Brand, Gennari, & de Rijke, 2003) differs from the tableauxbased and DPLL-based ones mostly in the fact that a CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) engine is used instead of tableaux/DPLL. KCSP is the only representative tool of this approach. • In the Inverse-method approach (Voronkov, 1999, 2001), a search procedure is based on the “inverted” version of a sequent calculus (which can be seen as a modalized version of propositional resolution). K K(Voronkov, 1999) is the only representative tool of this approach. • In the Automata-theoretic approach, (a symbolic representation based on BDDs – Binary Decision Diagrams – of) a tree automaton accepting all the tree models of the input formula is implicitly built and checked for emptiness (Pan, Sattler, & Vardi, 2002; Pan & Vardi, 2003). KBDD (Pan & Vardi, 2003) is the only representative tool of this approach. 1. Notice that there is not an universal agreement on the terminology “tableaux-based” and “DPLL-based”. E.g., tools like FaCT, DLP, and Racer are most often called “tableau-based”, although they use a DPLL-like algorithm instead of propositional tableaux for handling the propositional component of reasoning (Horrocks, 1998; Patel-Schneider, 1998; Horrocks & Patel-Schneider, 1999; Haarslev & Moeller, 2001).

input: Due to its ability to combine multiple base clusterings into a probably better and more robust clustering, the ensemble clustering technique has been attracting increasing attention in recent years. Despite the significant success, one limitation to most of the existing ensemble clustering methods is that they generally treat all base clusterings equally regardless of their reliability, which makes them vulnerable to low-quality base clusterings. Although some efforts have been made to (globally) evaluate and weight the base clusterings, yet these methods tend to view each base clustering as an individual and neglect the local diversity of clusters inside the same base clustering. It remains an open problem how to evaluate the reliability of clusters and exploit the local diversity in the ensemble to enhance the consensus performance, without access to data features or specific assumptions on data distribution. To address this, in this paper, we propose a novel ensemble clustering approach based on ensemble-driven cluster uncertainty estimation and local weighting strategy. In particular, the uncertainty of each cluster is estimated by considering the cluster labels in the entire ensemble via an entropic criterion. A novel ensemble-driven cluster validity measure is introduced, and a locally weighted co-association matrix is presented to serve as a summary for the ensemble of diverse clusters. With the local diversity in ensembles exploited, two novel consensus functions are further proposed. Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art.

This paper investigates the use of deep reinforcement learning for runtime parameters of cloud databases under latency constraints. Cloud services serve up to thousands of concurrent requests per second and can adjust critical parameters by leveraging performance metrics. In this work, we use continuous deep reinforcement learning to learn optimal cache expirations for HTTP caching in content delivery networks. To this end, we introduce a technique for asynchronous experience management called delayed experience injection, which facilitates delayed reward and next-state computation in concurrent environments where measurements are not immediately available. Evaluation results show that our approach based on normalized advantage functions and asynchronous CPU-only training outperforms a statistical estimator.

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

input: As a well-known NP-hard problem, the Three-Index Assignment Problem (AP3) has attracted lots of research efforts for developing heuristics. However, existing heuristics either obtain less competitive solutions or consume too much running time. In this paper, a new heuristic named Approximate Muscle guided Beam Search (AMBS) is developed to achieve a good trade-off between solution quality and running time. By combining the approximate muscle with beam search, the solution space size can be significantly decreased, thus the time for searching the solution can be sharply reduced. Extensive experimental results on the benchmark indicate that the new algorithm is able to obtain solutions with competitive quality and it can be employed on instances with large-scale. Work of this paper not only proposes a new efficient heuristic, but also provides a promising method to improve the efficiency of beam search.

input: Pattern classification systems are commonly used in adversarial applications, like biometric authentication, network intrusion detection, and spam filtering, in which data can be purposely manipulated by humans to undermine their operation. As this adversarial scenario is not taken into account by classical design methods, pattern classification systems may exhibit vulnerabilities, whose exploitation may severely affect their performance, and consequently limit their practical utility. Extending pattern classification theory and design methods to adversarial settings is thus a novel and very relevant research direction, which has not yet been pursued in a systematic way. In this paper, we address one of the main open issues: evaluating at design phase the security of pattern classifiers, namely, the performance degradation under potential attacks they may incur during operation. We propose a framework for empirical evaluation of classifier security that formalizes and generalizes the main ideas proposed in the literature, and give examples of its use in three real applications. Reported results show that security evaluation can provide a more complete understanding of the classifier’s behavior in adversarial environments, and lead to better design choices.

input: A key part of any evolutionary algorithm is fitness evaluation. When fitness evaluations are corrupted by noise, as happens in many real-world problems as a consequence of various types of uncertainty, a strategy is needed in order to cope with this. Resampling is one of the most common strategies, whereby each solution is evaluated many times in order to reduce the variance of the fitness estimates. When evaluating the performance of a noisy optimisation algorithm, a key consideration is the stopping condition for the algorithm. A frequently used stopping condition in runtime analysis, known as “First Hitting Time”, is to stop the algorithm as soon as it encounters the optimal solution. However, this is unrealistic for real-world problems, as if the optimal solution were already known, there would be no need to search for it. This paper argues that the use of First Hitting Time, despite being a commonly used approach, is significantly flawed and overestimates the quality of many algorithms in real-world cases, where the optimum is not known in advance and has to be genuinely searched for. A better alternative is to measure the quality of the solution an algorithm returns after a fixed evaluation budget, i.e., to focus on final solution quality. This paper argues that focussing on final solution quality is more realistic and demonstrates cases where the results produced by each algorithm evaluation method lead to very different conclusions regarding the quality of each noisy optimisation algorithm.

input: Item Response Theory (IRT) allows for measuring ability of Machine Learning models as compared to a human population. However, it is difficult to create a large dataset to train the ability of deep neural network models (DNNs). We propose Crowd-Informed Fine-Tuning (CIFT) as a new training process, where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned with a specialized supplemental training set obtained via IRT modelfitting on a large set of crowdsourced response patterns. With CIFT we can leverage the specialized set of data obtained through IRT to inform parameter tuning in DNNs. We experiment with two loss functions in CIFT to represent (i) memorization of fine-tuning items and (ii) learning a probability distribution over potential labels that is similar to the crowdsourced distribution over labels to simulate crowd knowledge. Our results show that CIFT improves ability for a state-of-theart DNN model for Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) tasks and is generalizable to a large-scale RTE test set.

Fundus images were normalized before segmentation was performed to enforce consistency in background lighting and contrast. For every effective point in the fundus image, our algorithm extracted three channels of input from the point’s neighbourhood and forwarded the response across the 7-layer network. The output layer consists of four neurons, representing background, optic disc, fovea and blood vessels. In average, our segmentation correctly classified 92.68% of the ground truths (on the testing set from Drive database). The highest accuracy achieved on a single image was 94.54%, the lowest 88.85%. A single convolutional neural network can be used not just to segment blood vessels, but also optic disc and fovea with good accuracy.

input: Kernel-based approaches for sequence classification have been successfully applied to a variety of domains, including the text categorization, image classification, speech analysis, biological sequence analysis, time series and music classification, where they show some of the most accurate results. Typical kernel functions for sequences in these domains (e.g., bag-of-words, mismatch, or subsequence kernels) are restricted to discrete univariate (i.e. one-dimensional) string data, such as sequences of words in the text analysis, codeword sequences in the image analysis, or nucleotide or amino acid sequences in the DNA and protein sequence analysis. However, original sequence data are often of real-valued multivariate nature, i.e. are not univariate and discrete as required by typical k-mer based sequence kernel functions. In this work, we consider the problem of the multivariate sequence classification (e.g., classification of multivariate music sequences, or multidimensional protein sequence representations). To this end, we extend univariate kernel functions typically used in sequence domains and propose efficient multivariate similarity kernel method (MVDFQ-SK) based on (1) a direct feature quantization (DFQ) of each sequence dimension in the original real-valued multivariate sequences and (2) applying novel multivariate discrete kernel measures on these multivariate discrete DFQ sequence representations to more accurately capture similarity relationships among sequences and improve classification performance. Experiments using the proposed MVDFQ-SK kernel method show excellent classification performance on three challenging music classification tasks as well as protein sequence classification with significant 25-40% improvements over univariate kernel methods and existing state-of-the-art sequence classification methods.

input: Contextual bandit learning is an increasingly popular approach to optimizing recommender systems via user feedback, but can be slow to converge in practice due to the need for exploring a large feature space. In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine hierarchical approach for encoding prior knowledge that drastically reduces the amount of exploration required. Intuitively, user preferences can be reasonably embedded in a coarse low-dimensional feature space that can be explored efficiently, requiring exploration in the high-dimensional space only as necessary. We introduce a bandit algorithm that explores within this coarse-to-fine spectrum, and prove performance guarantees that depend on how well the coarse space captures the user’s preferences.

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

input: While the optimization problem behind deep neural networks is highly non-convex, it is frequently observed in practice that training deep networks seems possible without getting stuck in suboptimal points. It has been argued that this is the case as all local minima are close to being globally optimal. We show that this is (almost) true, in fact almost all local minima are globally optimal, for a fully connected network with squared loss and analytic activation function given that the number of hidden units of one layer of the network is larger than the number of training points and the network structure from this layer on is pyramidal.

input: To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP). GNU Prolog is a general-purpose implementation of the Prolog language, which distinguishes itself from most other systems by being, above all else, a native-code compiler which produces standalone executables which don’t rely on any byte-code emulator or meta-interpreter. Other aspects which stand out include the explicit organization of the Prolog system as a multipass compiler, where intermediate representations are materialized, in Unix compiler tradition. GNU Prolog also includes an extensible and highperformance finite domain constraint solver, integrated with the Prolog language but implemented using independent lower-level mechanisms. This article discusses the main issues involved in designing and implementing GNU Prolog: requirements, system organization, performance and portability issues as well as its position with respect to other Prolog system implementations and the ISO standardization initiative.

We consider a large system consists of many nodes, where each node has its own rate of generating new events, or items. A monitoring application can probe a small number of nodes at each step, and our goal is to compute a probing schedule that minimizes the expected number of undiscovered items at the system, or equivalently, minimizes the expected time to discover a new item in the system. We study the Schedule Optimization problem both for deterministic and randomized memoryless algorithms. We provide lower bounds on the cost of an optimal schedule and construct close to optimal schedules with rigorous mathematical guarantees. Finally, we present an adaptive algorithm that starts with no prior information on the system and converges to the optimal memoryless algorithms by adapting to observed data.

Now complete the following example-
input: User-machine interaction is important for spoken content retrieval. For text content retrieval, the user can easily scan through and select on a list of retrieved item. This is impossible for spoken content retrieval, because the retrieved items are difficult to show on screen. Besides, due to the high degree of uncertainty for speech recognition, the retrieval results can be very noisy. One way to counter such difficulties is through user-machine interaction. The machine can take different actions to interact with the user to obtain better retrieval results before showing to the user. The suitable actions depend on the retrieval status, for example requesting for extra information from the user, returning a list of topics for user to select, etc. In our previous work, some hand-crafted states estimated from the present retrieval results are used to determine the proper actions. In this paper, we propose to use Deep-Q-Learning techniques instead to determine the machine actions for interactive spoken content retrieval. Deep-Q-Learning bypasses the need for estimation of the hand-crafted states, and directly determine the best action base on the present retrieval status even without any human knowledge. It is shown to achieve significantly better performance compared with the previous hand-crafted states.

Specifically, we show that with minor modifications to word2vec’s algorithm, we get principled language models that are closely related to the well-established Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) based language models. A compelling aspect of our approach is that our models are trained with the same simple negative sampling objective function that is commonly used in word2vec to learn word embeddings.

input: Dataset bias remains a significant barrier towards solving real world computer vision tasks. Though deep convolutional networks have proven to be a competitive approach for image classification, a question remains: have these models have solved the dataset bias problem? In general, training or fine-tuning a state-ofthe-art deep model on a new domain requires a significant amount of data, which for many applications is simply not available. Transfer of models directly to new domains without adaptation has historically led to poor recognition performance. In this paper, we pose the following question: is a single image dataset, much larger than previously explored for adaptation, comprehensive enough to learn general deep models that may be effectively applied to new image domains? In other words, are deep CNNs trained on large amounts of labeled data as susceptible to dataset bias as previous methods have been shown to be? We show that a generic supervised deep CNN model trained on a large dataset reduces, but does not remove, dataset bias. Furthermore, we propose several methods for adaptation with deep models that are able to operate with little (one example per category) or no labeled domain specific data. Our experiments show that adaptation of deep models on benchmark visual domain adaptation datasets can provide a significant performance boost.

input: In practice, a ranking of objects with respect to given set of criteria is of considerable importance. However, due to lack of knowledge, information of time pressure, decision makers might not be able to provide a (crisp) ranking of objects from the top to the bottom. Instead, some objects might be ranked equally, or better than other objects only to some degree. In such cases, a generalization of crisp rankings to fuzzy rankings can be more useful. The aim of the article is to introduce the notion of a fuzzy ranking and to discuss its several properties, namely orderings, similarity and indecisiveness. The proposed approach can be used both for group decision making or multiple criteria decision making when uncertainty is involved.

These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane.

input: Participants in recent discussions of AI-related issues ranging from intelligence explosion to technological unemployment have made diverse claims about the nature, pace, and drivers of progress in AI. However, these theories are rarely specified in enough detail to enable systematic evaluation of their assumptions or to extrapolate progress quantitatively, as is often done with some success in other technological domains. After reviewing relevant literatures and justifying the need for more rigorous modeling of AI progress, this paper contributes to that research program by suggesting ways to account for the relationship between hardware speed increases and algorithmic improvements in AI, the role of human inputs in enabling AI capabilities, and the relationships between different sub-fields of AI. It then outlines ways of tailoring AI progress models to generate insights on the specific issue of technological unemployment, and outlines future directions for research on AI progress.

In this paper, we proposed a neutrosophic recommender system to predict the diseases based on neutrosophic set which includes single-criterion neutrosophic recommender system (SCNRS) and multi-criterion neutrosophic recommender system (MC-NRS). Further, we investigated some algebraic operations of neutrosophic recommender system such as union, complement, intersection, probabilistic sum, bold sum, bold intersection, bounded difference, symmetric difference, convex linear sum of min and max operators, Cartesian product, associativity, commutativity and distributive. Based on these operations, we studied the algebraic structures such as lattices, Kleen algebra, de Morgan algebra, Brouwerian algebra, BCK algebra, Stone algebra and MV algebra. In addition, we introduced several types of similarity measures based on these algebraic operations and studied some of their theoretic properties. Moreover, we accomplished a prediction formula using the proposed algebraic similarity measure. We also proposed a new algorithm for medical diagnosis based on neutrosophic recommender system. Finally to check the validity of the proposed methodology, we made experiments on the datasets Heart, RHC, Breast cancer, Diabetes and DMD. At the end, we presented the MSE and computational time by comparing the proposed algorithm with the relevant ones such as ICSM, DSM, CARE, CFMD, as well as other variants namely Variant 67, Variant 69, and Varian 71 both in tabular and graphical form to analyze the efficiency and accuracy. Finally we analyzed the strength of all 8 algorithms by ANOVA statistical tool.

input: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are extensively used in image and video recognition, natural language processing and other machine learning applications. The success of CNNs in these areas corresponds with a significant increase in the number of parameters and computation costs. Recent approaches towards reducing these overheads involve pruning and compressing the weights of various layers without hurting the overall CNN performance. However, using model compression to generate sparse CNNs mostly reduces parameters from the fully connected layers and may not significantly reduce the final computation costs. In this paper, we present a compression technique for CNNs, where we prune the filters from CNNs that are identified as having a small effect on the output accuracy. By removing whole planes in the network, together with their connecting convolution kernels, the computational costs are reduced significantly. In contrast to other techniques proposed for pruning networks, this approach does not result in sparse connectivity patterns. Hence, our techniques do not need the support of sparse convolution libraries and can work with the most efficient BLAS operations for matrix multiplications. In our results, we show that even simple filter pruning techniques can reduce inference costs for VGG-16 by up to 34% and ResNet-110 by upto 38% while regaining close to the original accuracy by retraining the networks.

input: The paper addresses the problem of learning a regression model parameterized by a fixedrank positive semidefinite matrix. The focus is on the nonlinear nature of the search space and on scalability to high-dimensional problems. The mathematical developments rely on the theory of gradient descent algorithms adapted to the Riemannian geometry that underlies the set of fixed-rank positive semidefinite matrices. In contrast with previous contributions in the literature, no restrictions are imposed on the range space of the learned matrix. The resulting algorithms maintain a linear complexity in the problem size and enjoy important invariance properties. We apply the proposed algorithms to the problem of learning a distance function parameterized by a positive semidefinite matrix. Good performance is observed on classical benchmarks.

input: ""Background subtraction"" is an old technique for finding moving objects in a video sequence-for example, cars driving on a freeway. The idea is that subtracting the current image from a time­ averaged background image will leave only non­ stationary objects. It is, however, a crude ap­ proximation to the task of classifying each pixel of the current image; it fails with slow-moving objects and does not distinguish shadows from moving objects. The basic idea of this paper is that we can classify each pixel using a model of how that pixel looks when it is part of different classes. We learn a mixture-of-Gaussians classi­ fication model for each pixel using an unsuper­ vised technique-an efficient, incremental ver­ sion of EM. Unlike the standard image-averaging approach, this automatically updates the mixture component for each class according to likelihood of membership; hence slow-moving objects are handled perfectly. Our approach also identifies and eliminates shadows much more effectively than other techniques such as thresholding. Ap­ plication of this method as part of the Roadwatch traffic surveillance project is expected to result in significant improvements in vehicle identification and tracking.

This paper seeks an efficient and systematic discovery of non-obvious and valuable patterns between variables from a large database of solved cases via a probabilistic network (PN) modeling approach. The PN structure can be used to extract behavioral patterns and to gain insight into what factors influence these behaviors. Thus, when a new case is being investigated and the profile variables are unknown because the offender has yet to be identified, the observed crime scene variables are used to infer the unknown variables based on their connections in the structure and the corresponding numerical (probabilistic) weights. The objective is to produce a more systematic and empirical approach to profiling, and to use the resulting PN model as a decision tool.

We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves.

input: This paper explores the real-time summarization of scheduled events such as soccer games from torrential flows of Twitter streams. We propose and evaluate an approach that substantially shrinks the stream of tweets in real-time, and consists of two steps: (i) sub-event detection, which determines if something new has occurred, and (ii) tweet selection, which picks a representative tweet to describe each sub-event. We compare the summaries generated in three languages for all the soccer games in Copa America 2011 to reference live reports offered by Yahoo! Sports journalists. We show that simple text analysis methods which do not involve external knowledge lead to summaries that cover 84% of the sub-events on average, and 100% of key types of sub-events (such as goals in soccer). Our approach should be straightforwardly applicable to other kinds of scheduled events such as other sports, award ceremonies, keynote talks, TV shows, etc.

input: Massive public resume data emerging on the WWW indicates individual-related characteristics in terms of profile and career experiences. Resume Analysis (RA) provides opportunities for many applications, such as talent seeking and evaluation. Existing RA studies based on statistical analyzing have primarily focused on talent recruitment by identifying explicit attributes. However, they failed to discover the implicit semantic information, i.e., individual career progress patterns and social-relations, which are vital to comprehensive understanding of career development. Besides, how to visualize them for better human cognition is also challenging. To tackle these issues, we propose a visual analytics system ResumeVis to mine and visualize resume data. Firstly, a text-mining based approach is presented to extract semantic information. Then, a set of visualizations are devised to represent the semantic information in multiple perspectives. By interactive exploration on ResumeVis performed by domain experts, the following tasks can be accomplished: to trace individual career evolving trajectory; to mine latent social-relations among individuals; and to hold the full picture of massive resumes’ collective mobility. Case studies with over 2500 online officer resumes demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. We provide a demonstration video.

input: Selecting the right web links for a website is important because appropriate links not only can provide high attractiveness but can also increase the website’s revenue. In this work, we first show that web links have an intrinsic multilevel feedback structure. For example, consider a 2-level feedback web link: the 1st level feedback provides the Click-Through Rate (CTR) and the 2nd level feedback provides the potential revenue, which collectively produce the compound 2-level revenue. We consider the context-free links selection problem of selecting links for a homepage so as to maximize the total compound 2-level revenue while keeping the total 1st level feedback above a preset threshold. We further generalize the problem to links with n (n≥2)-level feedback structure. To our best knowledge, we are the first to model the links selection problem as a constrained multi-armed bandit problem and design an effective links selection algorithm by learning the links’ multi-level structure with provable sub-linear regret and violation bounds. We uncover the multi-level feedback structures of web links in two real-world datasets. We also conduct extensive experiments on the datasets to compare our proposed LExp algorithm with two state-of-the-art context-free bandit algorithms and show that LExp algorithm is the most effective in links selection while satisfying the constraint.

The BFO is imitated from the behavior of the foraging bacteria group such as Ecoli. The main aim of algorithm is to eliminate those bacteria that have weak foraging methods and maintaining those bacteria that have strong foraging methods. In this extent, each bacterium communicates with other bacteria by sending signals such that bacterium change the position in the next step if prior factors have been satisfied. In fact, the process of algorithm allows bacteria to follow up nutrients toward the optimal. In this paper, the BFO is used for the solutions of Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP), and multiobjective QAP (mQAP) by using updating mechanisms including mutation, crossover, and a local search.

input: Multitask learning algorithms are typically designed assuming some fixed, a priori known latent structure shared by all the tasks. However, it is usually unclear what type of latent task structure is the most appropriate for a given multitask learning problem. Ideally, the “right” latent task structure should be learned in a data-driven manner. We present a flexible, nonparametric Bayesian model that posits a mixture of factor analyzers structure on the tasks. The nonparametric aspect makes the model expressive enough to subsume many existing models of latent task structures (e.g, meanregularized tasks, clustered tasks, low-rank or linear/non-linear subspace assumption on tasks, etc.). Moreover, it can also learn more general task structures, addressing the shortcomings of such models. We present a variational inference algorithm for our model. Experimental results on synthetic and realworld datasets, on both regression and classification problems, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

input: We consider the problem of detecting an epidemic in a population where individual diagnoses are extremely noisy. The motivation for this problem is the plethora of examples (influenza strains in humans, or computer viruses in smartphones, etc.) where reliable diagnoses are scarce, but noisy data plentiful. In flu/phone-viruses, exceedingly few infected people/phones are professionally diagnosed (only a small fraction go to a doctor) but less reliable secondary signatures (e.g., people staying home, or greater-than-typical upload activity) are more readily available. These secondary data are often plagued by unreliability: many people with the flu do not stay home, and many people that stay home do not have the flu. This paper identifies the precise regime where knowledge of the contact network enables finding the needle in the haystack: we provide a distributed, efficient and robust algorithm that can correctly identify the existence of a spreading epidemic from highly unreliable local data. Our algorithm requires only local-neighbor knowledge of this graph, and in a broad array of settings that we describe, succeeds even when false negatives and false positives make up an overwhelming fraction of the data available. Our results show it succeeds in the presence of partial information about the contact network, and also when there is not a single “patient zero,” but rather many (hundreds, in our examples) of initial patient-zeroes, spread across the graph.

Covering rough sets are a natural extension of classical rough sets by relaxing the partitions arising from equivalence relations to covers. Recently, some topological concepts such as neighborhood have been applied to covering rough sets. In this paper, we further investigate the covering rough sets based on neighborhoods by approximation operations. We show that the upper approximation based on neighborhoods can be defined equivalently without using neighborhoods. To analyze the covers themselves, we introduce unary and composition operations on covers. A notion of homomorphism is provided to relate two covering approximation spaces. We also examine the properties of approximations preserved by the operations and homomorphisms, respectively.

We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset.

input: Domain adaptation, and transfer learning more generally, seeks to remedy the problem created when training and testing datasets are generated by different distributions. In this work, we introduce a new unsupervised domain adaptation algorithm for when there are multiple sources available to a learner. Our technique assigns a rough labeling on the target samples, then uses it to learn a transformation that aligns the two datasets before final classification. In this article we give a convenient implementation of our method, show several experiments using it, and compare it to other methods commonly used in the field.

input: Most existing Neural Machine Translation models use groups of characters or whole words as their unit of input and output. We propose a model with a hierarchical char2word encoder, that takes individual characters both as input and output. We first argue that this hierarchical representation of the character encoder reduces computational complexity, and show that it improves translation performance. Secondly, by qualitatively studying attention plots from the decoder we find that the model learns to compress common words into a single embedding whereas rare words, such as names and places, are represented character by character.

input: Despite outstanding success in vision amongst other domains, many of the recent deep learning approaches have evident drawbacks for robots. This manuscript surveys recent work in the literature that pertain to applying deep learning systems to the robotics domain, either as means of estimation or as a tool to resolve motor commands directly from raw percepts. These recent advances are only a piece to the puzzle. We suggest that deep learning as a tool alone is insufficient in building a unified framework to acquire general intelligence. For this reason, we complement our survey with insights from cognitive development and refer to ideas from classical control theory, producing an integrated direction for a lifelong learning architecture.

input: A number of visual question answering approaches have been proposed recently, aiming at understanding the visual scenes by answering the natural language questions. While the image question answering has drawn significant attention, video question answering is largely unexplored. Video-QA is different from Image-QA since the information and the events are scattered among multiple frames. In order to better utilize the temporal structure of the videos and the phrasal structures of the answers, we propose two mechanisms: the re-watching and the re-reading mechanisms and combine them into the forgettable-watcher model. Then we propose a TGIF-QA dataset for video question answering with the help of automatic question generation. Finally, we evaluate the models on our dataset. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed models.

It can be viewed as a deep extension of the layerwise contractive auto-encoder penalty. More importantly, it unifies previous proposals for adversarial training of deep neural nets – this list includes directly modifying the gradient, training on a mix of original and adversarial examples, using contractive penalties, and approximately optimizing constrained adversarial objective functions. In an experiment using a Deep Sparse Rectifier Network, we find that the deep Jacobian regularization of DataGrad (which also has L1 and L2 flavors of regularization) outperforms traditional L1 and L2 regularization both on the original dataset as well as on adversarial examples.

input: In computing, spell checking is the process of detecting and sometimes providing spelling suggestions for incorrectly spelled words in a text. Basically, a spell checker is a computer program that uses a dictionary of words to perform spell checking. The bigger the dictionary is, the higher is the error detection rate. The fact that spell checkers are based on regular dictionaries, they suffer from data sparseness problem as they cannot capture large vocabulary of words including proper names, domain-specific terms, technical jargons, special acronyms, and terminologies. As a result, they exhibit low error detection rate and often fail to catch major errors in the text. This paper proposes a new context-sensitive spelling correction method for detecting and correcting non-word and real-word errors in digital text documents. The approach hinges around data statistics from Google Web 1T 5-gram data set which consists of a big volume of n-gram word sequences, extracted from the World Wide Web. Fundamentally, the proposed method comprises an error detector that detects misspellings, a candidate spellings generator based on a character 2-gram model that generates correction suggestions, and an error corrector that performs contextual error correction. Experiments conducted on a set of text documents from different domains and containing misspellings, showed an outstanding spelling error correction rate and a drastic reduction of both non-word and real-word errors. In a further study, the proposed algorithm is to be parallelized so as to lower the computational cost of the error detection and correction processes.

input: LTL synthesis – the construction of a function to satisfy a logical specification formulated in Linear Temporal Logic – is a 2EXPTIME-complete problem with relevant applications in controller synthesis and a myriad of artificial intelligence applications. In this research note we consider De Giacomo and Vardi’s variant of the synthesis problem for LTL formulas interpreted over finite rather than infinite traces. Rather surprisingly, given the existing claims on complexity, we establish that LTL synthesis is EXPTIME-complete for the finite interpretation, and not 2EXPTIME-complete as previously reported. Our result coincides nicely with the planning perspective where non-deterministic planning with full observability is EXPTIME-complete and partial observability increases the complexity to 2EXPTIME-complete; a recent related result for LTL synthesis shows that in the finite case with partial observability, the problem is 2EXPTIME-complete.

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum.

input: Nowadays, neural networks play an important role in the task of relation classification. By designing different neural architectures, researchers have improved the performance to a large extent, compared with traditional methods. However, existing neural networks for relation classification are usually of shallow architectures (e.g., one-layer convolution neural networks or recurrent networks). They may fail to explore the potential representation space in different abstraction levels. In this paper, we propose deep recurrent neural networks (DRNNs) to tackle this challenge. Further, we propose a data augmentation method by leveraging the directionality of relations. We evaluate our DRNNs on the SemEval-2010 Task 8, and achieve an F1score of 85.81%, outperforming state-of-theart recorded results.

input: The generation of political event data has remained much the same since the mid-1990s, both in terms of data acquisition and the process of coding text into data. Since the 1990s, however, there have been significant improvements in open-source natural language processing software and in the availability of digitized news content. This paper presents a new, next-generation event dataset, named Phoenix, that builds from these and other advances. This dataset includes improvements in the underlying news collection process and event coding software, along with the creation of a general processing pipeline necessary to produce daily-updated data. This paper provides a face validity checks by briefly examining the data for the conflict in Syria, and a comparison between Phoenix and the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System data. 1 Moving Event Data Forward Automated coding of political event data, or the record of who-did-what-towhom within the context of political actions, has existed for roughly two decades. The approach has remained largely the same during this time, with the underlying coding procedures not updating to reflect changes in natural language processing (NLP) technology. These NLP technologies have now advanced to such a level, and with accompanying open-source software implementations, that their inclusion in the event-data coding process comes as an obvious advancement. When combined with changes in how news content is obtained, the ability to store and process large amounts of text, and enhancements based on two decades worth of event-data experience, it becomes clear that political event data is ready for a next generation dataset. In this chapter, I provide the technical details for creating such a nextgeneration dataset. The technical details lead to a pipeline for the production of the Phoenix event dataset. The Phoenix dataset is a daily updated, nearreal-time political event dataset. The coding process makes use of open-source NLP software, an abundance of online news content, and other technical advances made possible by open-source software. This enables a dataset that is transparent and replicable, while providing a more accurate coding process than previously possible. Additionally, the dataset’s near-real-time nature also enables many applications that were previously impossible with batchupdated datasets, such as monitoring of ongoing events. Thus, this dataset

input: Multiclass prediction is the problem of classifying an object into a relevant target class. We consider the problem of learning a multiclass predictor that uses only few features, and in particular, the number of used features should increase sub-linearly with the number of possible classes. This implies that features should be shared by several classes. We describe and analyze the ShareBoost algorithm for learning a multiclass predictor that uses few shared features. We prove that ShareBoost efficiently finds a predictor that uses few shared features (if such a predictor exists) and that it has a small generalization error. We also describe how to use ShareBoost for learning a non-linear predictor that has a fast evaluation time. In a series of experiments with natural data sets we demonstrate the benefits of ShareBoost and evaluate its success relatively to other state-of-the-art approaches.

input: Quantifying the degree of spatial dependence for linguistic variables is a key task for analyzing dialectal variation. However, existing approaches have important drawbacks. First, they make unjustified assumptions about the nature of spatial variation: some assume that the geographical distribution of linguistic variables is Gaussian, while others assume that linguistic variation is aligned to pre-defined geopolitical units such as states or counties. Second, they are not applicable to all types of linguistic data: some approaches apply only to frequencies, others to boolean indicators of whether a linguistic variable is present. We present a new method for measuring geographical language variation, which solves both of these problems. Our approach builds on reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) representations for nonparametric statistics, and takes the form of a test statistic that is computed from pairs of individual geotagged observations without aggregation into predefined geographical bins. We compare this test with prior work using synthetic data as well as a diverse set of real datasets: a corpus of Dutch tweets, a Dutch syntactic atlas, and a dataset of letters to the editor in North American newspapers. Our proposed test is shown to support robust inferences across a broad range of scenarios and types of data.

input: In security-sensitive applications, the success of machine learning depends on a thorough vetting of their resistance to adversarial data. In one pertinent, well-motivated attack scenario, an adversary may attempt to evade a deployed system at test time by carefully manipulating attack samples. In this work, we present a simple but effective gradientbased approach that can be exploited to systematically assess the security of several, widely-used classification algorithms against evasion attacks. Following a recently proposed framework for security evaluation, we simulate attack scenarios that exhibit different risk levels for the classifier by increasing the attacker’s knowledge of the system and her ability to manipulate attack samples. This gives the classifier designer a better picture of the classifier performance under evasion attacks, and allows him to perform a more informed model selection (or parameter setting). We evaluate our approach on the relevant security task of malware detection in PDF files, and show that such systems can be easily evaded. We also sketch some countermeasures suggested by our analysis.

input: Denoising autoencoders (DAs) are typically applied to relatively large datasets for unsupervised learning of representative data encodings; they rely on the idea of making the learned representations robust to partial corruption of the input pattern, and perform learning using stochastic gradient descent with relatively large datasets. In this paper, we present a fully Bayesian DA architecture that allows for the application of DAs even when data is scarce. Our novel approach formulates the signal encoding problem under a nonparametric Bayesian regard, considering a Gaussian process prior over the latent input encodings generated given the (corrupt) input observations. Subsequently, the decoder modules of our model are formulated as large-margin regression models, treated under the Bayesian inference paradigm, by exploiting the maximum entropy discrimination (MED) framework. We exhibit the effectiveness of our approach using several datasets, dealing with both classification and transfer learning applications.

input: The subpath planning problem is a branch of the path planning problem, which has widespread applications in automated manufacturing process as well as vehicle and robot navigation. This problem is to find the shortest path or tour subject for travelling a set of given subpaths. The current approaches for dealing with the subpath planning problem are all based on meta-heuristic approaches. It is well-known that meta-heuristic based approaches have several deficiencies. To address them, we propose a novel approximation algorithm in the O(n3) time complexity class, which guarantees to solve any subpath planning problem instance with the fixed ratio bound of 2. Beside the formal proofs of the claims, our empirical evaluation shows that our approximation method acts much better than a state-of-the-art method, both in result and execution time. Note to Practitioners—In some real world applications such as robot and vehicle navigation in structured and industrial environments as well as some of the manufacturing processes such as electronic printing and polishing, it is required for the agent to travel a set of predefined paths. Automating this process includes three steps: 1) capturing the environment of the actual problem and formulating it as a subpath planning problem; 2) solving subpath planning problem to find the near optimal path or tour; 3) command the robot to follow the output. The most challenging phase is the second one that this paper tries to tackle it. To design an effective automation for the aforementioned applications, it is essential to make use of methods with low computational cost but near optimal outputs in the second phase. According to the fact that the length of the final output has a direct effect on the cost of performing the task, it is desirable to incorporate methods with low complexity that can guarantee a bound for the difference between length of the optimal path and 1 ar X iv :1 60 3. 06 21 7v 1 [ cs .R O ] 2 0 M ar 2 01 6 the output. Current approaches for solving subpath planning problem are all meta-heuristic based. These methods do not provide such a bound. And plus, they are usually very time consuming. They may find promising results for some instances of problems, but there is no guarantee that they always exhibit such a good behaviour. In this paper, in order to avoid the issues of metaheuristics methods, we present an approximation algorithm, which provides an appropriate bound for the optimality of its solution. To gauge the performance of proposed methods, we conducted a set of experiments the results of which show that our proposed method finds shorter paths in less time in comparison with a state-of-the-art method.

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane.

input: In many settings, we have multiple data sets (also called views) that capture different and overlapping aspects of the same phenomenon. We are often interested in finding patterns that are unique to one or to a subset of the views. For example, we might have one set of molecular observations and one set of physiological observations on the same group of individuals, and we want to quantify molecular patterns that are uncorrelated with physiology. Despite being a common problem, this is highly challenging when the correlations come from complex distributions. In this paper, we develop the general framework of Rich Component Analysis (RCA) to model settings where the observations from different views are driven by different sets of latent components, and each component can be a complex, highdimensional distribution. We introduce algorithms based on cumulant extraction that provably learn each of the components without having to model the other components. We show how to integrate RCA with stochastic gradient descent into a meta-algorithm for learning general models, and demonstrate substantial improvement in accuracy on several synthetic and real datasets in both supervised and unsupervised tasks. Our method makes it possible to learn latent variable models when we don’t have samples from the true model but only samples after complex perturbations.

input: In this paper, we address the problem of data description using a Bayesian framework. The goal of data description is to draw a boundary around objects of a certain class of interest to discriminate that class from the rest of the feature space. Data description is also known as one-class learning and has a wide range of applications. The proposed approach uses a Bayesian framework to precisely compute the class boundary and therefore can utilize domain information in form of prior knowledge in the framework. It can also operate in the kernel space and therefore recognize arbitrary boundary shapes. Moreover, the proposed method can utilize unlabeled data in order to improve accuracy of discrimination. We evaluate our method using various real-world datasets and compare it with other state of the art approaches of data description. Experiments show promising results and improved performance over other data description and one-class learning algorithms.

However, there is an inherent degree of vagueness present in huge real life data. This impreciseness is handled by Fuzzy Sets. In this Paper, Fuzzy Mixed Integer Optimization Method (FMIOM) is used to find solution to Regression problem. The methodology exploits discrete character of problem. In this way large scale problems are solved within practical limits. The data points are separated into different polyhedral regions and each region has its own distinct regression coefficients. In this attempt, an attention is drawn to Statistics and Data Mining community that Integer Optimization can be significantly used to revisit different Statistical problems. Computational experimentations with generated and real data sets show that FMIOM is comparable to and often outperforms current leading methods. The results illustrate potential for significant impact of Fuzzy Integer Optimization methods on Computational Statistics and Data Mining.

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions.

While the idea of domain-agnostic meta-learning is appealing, this emerging field must come to terms with its relationship to human cognition and the statistics and structure of the tasks humans perform.

input: Normalized graph cut (NGC) has become a popular research topic due to its wide applications in a large variety of areas like machine learning and very large scale integration (VLSI) circuit design. Most of traditional NGC methods are based on pairwise relationships (similarities). However, in real-world applications relationships among the vertices (objects) may be more complex than pairwise, which are typically represented as hyperedges in hypergraphs. Thus, normalized hypergraph cut (NHC) has attracted more and more attention. Existing NHC methods cannot achieve satisfactory performance in real applications. In this paper, we propose a novel relaxation approach, which is called relaxed NHC (RNHC), to solve the NHC problem. Our model is defined as an optimization problem on the Stiefel manifold. To solve this problem, we resort to the Cayley transformation to devise a feasible learning algorithm. Experimental results on a set of large hypergraph benchmarks for clustering and partitioning in VLSI domain show that RNHC can outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

input: We study the problem of identifying the best action among a set of possible options when the value of each action is given by a mapping from a number of noisy micro-observables in the so-called fixed confidence setting. Our main motivation is the application to the minimax game search, which has been a major topic of interest in artificial intelligence. In this paper we introduce an abstract setting to clearly describe the essential properties of the problem. While previous work only considered a two-move game tree search problem, our abstract setting can be applied to the general minimax games where the depth can be non-uniform and arbitrary, and transpositions are allowed. We introduce a new algorithm (LUCB-micro) for the abstract setting, and give its lower and upper sample complexity results. Our bounds recover some previous results, which were only available in more limited settings, while they also shed further light on how the structure of minimax problems influence sample complexity.

input: Opinion mining aims at extracting useful subjective information from reliable amounts of text. Opinion mining holder recognition is a task that has not been considered yet in Arabic Language. This task essentially requires deep understanding of clauses structures. Unfortunately, the lack of a robust, publicly available, Arabic parser further complicates the research. This paper presents a leading research for the opinion holder extraction in Arabic news independent from any lexical parsers. We investigate constructing a comprehensive feature set to compensate the lack of parsing structural outcomes. The proposed feature set is tuned from English previous works coupled with our proposed semantic field and named entities features. Our feature analysis is based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and semi-supervised pattern recognition techniques. Different research models are evaluated via cross-validation experiments achieving 54.03 F-measure. We publicly release our own research outcome corpus and lexicon for opinion mining community to encourage further research.

input: Plagiarism is one of the growing issues in academia and is always a concern in Universities and other academic institutions. The situation is becoming even worse with the availability of ample resources on the web. This paper focuses on creating an effective and fast tool for plagiarism detection for text based electronic assignments. Our plagiarism detection tool named AntiPlag is developed using the tri-gram sequence matching technique. Three sets of text based assignments were tested by AntiPlag and the results were compared against an existing commercial plagiarism detection tool. AntiPlag showed better results in terms of false positives compared to the commercial tool due to the pre-processing steps performed in AntiPlag. In addition, to improve the detection latency, AntiPlag applies a data clustering technique making it four times faster than the commercial tool considered. AntiPlag could be used to isolate plagiarized text based assignments from non-plagiarised assignments easily. Therefore, we present AntiPlag, a fast and effective tool for plagiarism detection on text based electronic assignments.

But is this assumption true? And, in either case, what are the characteristics of such fraudulent behaviors? In this work, we set up honeypots, (“dummy” social network accounts), and buy fake followers (after careful IRB approval). We report the signs of such behaviors including oddities in local network connectivity, account attributes, and similarities and differences across fraud providers. Most valuably, we discover and characterize several types of fraud behaviors. We discuss how to leverage our insights in practice by engineering strongly performing entropy-based features and demonstrating high classification accuracy. Our contributions are (a) instrumentation: we detail our experimental setup and carefully engineered data collection process to scrape Twitter data while respecting API rate-limits, (b) observations on fraud multimodality: we analyze our honeypot fraudster ecosystem and give surprising insights into the multifaceted behaviors of these fraudster types, and (c) features: we propose novel features that give strong (>0.95 precision/recall) discriminative power on ground-truth Twitter data.

input: We consider the adaptive shortest-path routing problem in wireless networks under unknown and stochastically varying link states. In this problem, we aim to optimize the quality of communication between a source and a destination through adaptive path selection. Due to the randomness and uncertainties in the network dynamics, the quality of each link varies over time according to a stochastic process with unknown distributions. After a path is selected for communication, the aggregated quality of all links on this path (e.g., total path delay) is observed. The quality of each individual link is not observable. We formulate this problem as a multi-armed bandit with dependent arms. We show that by exploiting arm dependencies, a regret polynomial with network size can be achieved while maintaining the optimal logarithmic order with time. This is in sharp contrast with the exponential regret order with network size offered by a direct application of the classic MAB policies that ignore arm dependencies. Furthermore, our results are obtained under a general model of link-quality distributions (including heavy-tailed distributions) and find applications in cognitive radio and ad hoc networks with unknown and dynamic communication environments.

Both text analysis and control strategies are learned jointly using only a feedback signal inherent to the application. To effectively leverage textual information, our method automatically extracts the text segment most relevant to the current game state, and labels it with a task-centric predicate structure. This labeled text is then used to bias an action selection policy for the game, guiding it towards promising regions of the action space. We encode our model for text analysis and game playing in a multi-layer neural network, representing linguistic decisions via latent variables in the hidden layers, and game action quality via the output layer. Operating within the Monte-Carlo Search framework, we estimate model parameters using feedback from simulated games. We apply our approach to the complex strategy game Civilization II using the official game manual as the text guide. Our results show that a linguistically-informed game-playing agent significantly outperforms its language-unaware counterpart, yielding a 34% absolute improvement and winning over 65% of games when playing against the built-in AI of Civilization.

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

input: We address a challenging fine-grain classification problem: recognizing a font style from an image of text. In this task, it is very easy to generate lots of rendered font examples but very hard to obtain real-world labeled images. This realto-synthetic domain gap caused poor generalization to new real data in previous methods (Chen et al. (2014)). In this paper, we refer to Convolutional Neural Networks, and use an adaptation technique based on a Stacked Convolutional AutoEncoder that exploits unlabeled real-world images combined with synthetic data. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of higher than 80% (top-5) on a realworld dataset.

input: Recently, triggered by the impressive results in TV-games or game of Go by Google DeepMind, end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) is collecting attentions. Although little is known, the author’s group has propounded this framework for around 20 years and already has shown a variety of functions that emerge in a neural network (NN) through RL. In this paper, they are introduced again at this timing. “Function Modularization” approach is deeply penetrated subconsciously. The inputs and outputs for a learning system can be raw sensor signals and motor commands. “State space” or “action space” generally used in RL show the existence of functional modules. That has limited reinforcement learning to learning only for the action-planning module. In order to extend reinforcement learning to learning of the entire function on a huge degree of freedom of a massively parallel learning system and to explain or develop human-like intelligence, the author has believed that end-to-end RL from sensors to motors using a recurrent NN (RNN) becomes an essential key. Especially in the higher functions, since their inputs or outputs are difficult to decide, this approach is very effective by being free from the need to decide them. The functions that emerge, we have confirmed, through RL using a NN cover a broad range from real robot learning with raw camera pixel inputs to acquisition of dynamic functions in a RNN. Those are (1)image recognition, (2)color constancy (optical illusion), (3)sensor motion (active recognition), (4)hand-eye coordination and hand reaching movement, (5)explanation of brain activities, (6)communication, (7)knowledge transfer, (8)memory, (9)selective attention, (10)prediction, (11)exploration. The end-to-end RL enables the emergence of very flexible comprehensive functions that consider many things in parallel although it is difficult to give the boundary of each function clearly.

input: The ability to perform pixel-wise semantic segmentation in real-time is of paramount importance in practical mobile applications. Recent deep neural networks aimed at this task have the disadvantage of requiring a large number of floating point operations and have long run-times that hinder their usability. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network architecture named ENet (efficient neural network), created specifically for tasks requiring low latency operation. ENet is up to 18× faster, requires 75× less FLOPs, has 79× less parameters, and provides similar or better accuracy to existing models. We have tested it on CamVid, Cityscapes and SUN datasets and report on comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods, and the trade-offs between accuracy and processing time of a network. We present performance measurements of the proposed architecture on embedded systems and suggest possible software improvements that could make ENet even faster.

input: We discuss methodological issues related to the evaluation of unsupervised binary code construction methods for nearest neighbor search. These issues have been widely ignored in literature. These coding methods attempt to preserve either Euclidean distance or angular (cosine) distance in the binary embedding space. We explain why when comparing a method whose goal is preserving cosine similarity to one designed for preserving Euclidean distance, the original features should be normalized by mapping them to the unit hypersphere before learning the binary mapping functions. To compare a method whose goal is to preserves Euclidean distance to one that preserves cosine similarity, the original feature data must be mapped to a higher dimension by including a bias term in binary mapping functions. These conditions ensure the fair comparison between different binary code methods for the task of nearest neighbor search. Our experiments show under these conditions the very simple methods (e.g. LSH and ITQ) often outperform recent state-of-the-art methods (e.g. MDSH and OK-means).

input: Studying characters plays a vital role in computationally representing and interpreting narratives. Unlike previous work, which has focused on inferring character roles, we focus on the problem of modeling their relationships. Rather than assuming a fixed relationship for a character pair, we hypothesize that relationships are dynamic and temporally evolve with the progress of the narrative, and formulate the problem of relationship modeling as a structured prediction problem. We propose a semisupervised framework to learn relationship sequences from fully as well as partially labeled data. We present a Markovian model capable of accumulating historical beliefs about the relationship and status changes. We use a set of rich linguistic and semantically motivated features that incorporate world knowledge to investigate the textual content of narrative. We empirically demonstrate that such a framework outperforms competitive baselines.

Typical approaches to plan recognition start with a specification of the possible plans the other agents may be follow­ ing, and develop special techniques for dis­ criminating among the possibilities. Perhaps more desirable would be a uniform procedure for mapping plans to general structures sup­ porting inference based on uncertain and in­ complete observations. In this paper, we de­ scribe a set of methods for converting plans represented in a flexible procedural language to observation models represented as proba­ bilistic belief networks.

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

input: This work proposes a novel support vector machine (SVM) based robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) front-end that operates on an ensemble of the subband components of high-dimensional acoustic waveforms. The key issues of selecting the appropriate SVM kernels for classification in frequency subbands and the combination of individual subband classifiers using ensemble methods are addressed. The proposed front-end is compared with state-of-the-art ASR front-ends in terms of robustness to additive noise and linear filtering. Experiments performed on the TIMIT phoneme classification task demonstrate the benefits of the proposed subband based SVM front-end: it outperforms the standard cepstral front-end in the presence of noise and linear filtering for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) below 12-dB. A combination of the proposed front-end with a conventional front-end such as MFCC yields further improvements over the individual front ends across the full range of noise levels.

input: We investigate the use of temporally abstract actions, or macro-actions, in the solution of Markov decision processes. Unlike current mod­ els that combine both primitive actions and macro-actions and leave the state space un­ changed, we propose a hierarchical model (using an abstract MDP) that works with macro-actions only, and that significantly reduces the size of the state space. This is achieved by treating macro­ actions as local policies that act in certain regions of state space, and by restricting states in the ab­ stract MDP to those at the boundaries of regions. The abstract MDP approximates the original and can be solved more efficiently. We discuss sev­ eral ways in which macro-actions can be gen­ erated to ensure good solution quality. Finally, we consider ways in which macro-actions can be reused to solve multiple, related MDPs; and we show that this can justify the computational over­ head of macro-action generation.

input: Many real-world applications require robust algorithms to learn point processes based on a type of incomplete data — the so-called short doublycensored (SDC) event sequences. We study this critical problem of quantitative asynchronous event sequence analysis under the framework of Hawkes processes by leveraging the idea of data synthesis. Given SDC event sequences observed in a variety of time intervals, we propose a sampling-stitching data synthesis method — sampling predecessors and successors for each SDC event sequence from potential candidates and stitching them together to synthesize long training sequences. The rationality and the feasibility of our method are discussed in terms of arguments based on likelihood. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that the proposed data synthesis method improves learning results indeed for both timeinvariant and time-varying Hawkes processes.

input: Recent work has proposed several generative neural models for constituency parsing that achieve state-of-the-art results. Since direct search in these generative models is difficult, they have primarily been used to rescore candidate outputs from base parsers in which decoding is more straightforward. We first present an algorithm for direct search in these generative models. We then demonstrate that the rescoring results are at least partly due to implicit model combination rather than reranking effects. Finally, we show that explicit model combination can improve performance even further, resulting in new state-of-the-art numbers on the PTB of 94.25 F1 when training only on gold data and 94.66 F1 when using external data.

input: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the major public health problems in the world. It is a well-known fact that around one million people suffer from Parkinson’s disease in the United States whereas the number of people suffering from Parkinson’s disease worldwide is around 5 millions. Thus, it is important to predict Parkinson’s disease in early stages so that early plan for the necessary treatment can be made. People are mostly familiar with the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, however an increasing amount of research is being done to predict the Parkinson’s disease from non-motor symptoms that precede the motor ones. If early and reliable prediction is possible then a patient can get a proper treatment at the right time. Nonmotor symptoms considered are Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD) and olfactory loss. Developing machine learning models that can help us in predicting the disease can play a vital role in early prediction. In this paper we extend a work which used the non-motor features such as RBD and olfactory loss. Along with this the extended work also uses important biomarkers. In this paper we try to model this classifier using different machine learning models that have not been used before. We developed automated diagnostic models using Multilayer Perceptron, BayesNet, Random Forest and Boosted Logistic Regression. It has been observed that Boosted Logistic Regression provides the best performance with an impressive accuracy of 97.159 % and the area under the ROC curve was 98.9%. Thus, it is concluded that this models can be used for early prediction of Parkinson’s disease.

input: Program authorship attribution has implications for the privacy of programmers who wish to contribute code anonymously. While previous work has shown that complete files that are individually authored can be attributed, we show here for the first time that accounts belonging to open source contributors containing short, incomplete, and typically uncompilable fragments can also be effectively attributed. We propose a technique for authorship attribution of contributor accounts containing small source code samples, such as those that can be obtained from version control systems or other direct comparison of sequential versions. We show that while application of previous methods to individual small source code samples yields an accuracy of about 73% for 106 programmers as a baseline, by ensembling and averaging the classification probabilities of a sufficiently large set of samples belonging to the same author we achieve 99% accuracy for assigning the set of samples to the correct author. Through these results, we demonstrate that attribution is an important threat to privacy for programmers even in real-world collaborative environments such as GitHub. Additionally, we propose the use of calibration curves to identify samples by unknown and previously unencountered authors in the open world setting. We show that we can also use these calibration curves in the case that we do not have linking information and thus are forced to classify individual samples directly. This is because the calibration curves allow us to identify which samples are more likely to have been correctly attributed. Using such a curve can help an analyst choose a cut-off point which will prevent most misclassifications, at the cost of causing the rejection of some of the more dubious correct attributions.

input: Software design is crucial to successful software development, yet is a demanding multi-objective problem for software engineers. In an attempt to assist the software designer, interactive (i.e. human in-the-loop) meta-heuristic search techniques such as evolutionary computing have been applied and show promising results. Recent investigations have also shown that Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) can outperform evolutionary computing as a potential search engine for interactive software design. With a limited computational budget, ACO produces superior candidate design solutions in a smaller number of iterations. Building on these findings, we propose a novel interactive ACO (iACO) approach to assist the designer in early lifecycle software design, in which the search is steered jointly by subjective designer evaluation as well as machine fitness functions relating the structural integrity and surrogate elegance of software designs. Results show that iACO is speedy, responsive and highly effective in enabling interactive, dynamic multi-objective search in early lifecycle software design. Study participants rate the iACO search experience as compelling. Results of machine learning of fitness measure weightings indicate that software design elegance does indeed play a significant role in designer evaluation of candidate software design. We conclude that the evenness of the number of attributes and methods among classes (NAC) is a significant surrogate elegance measure, which in turn suggests that this evenness of distribution, when combined with structural integrity, is an implicit but crucial component of effective early lifecycle software design.

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum.

input: An evaluation of distributed word representation is generally conducted using a word similarity task and/or a word analogy task. There are many datasets readily available for these tasks in English. However, evaluating distributed representation in languages that do not have such resources (e.g., Japanese) is difficult. Therefore, as a first step toward evaluating distributed representations in Japanese, we constructed a Japanese word similarity dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our dataset is the first resource that can be used to evaluate distributed representations in Japanese. Moreover, our dataset contains various parts of speech and includes rare words in addition to common words.

input: When you need to enable deep learning on low-cost embedded SoCs, is it better to port an existing deep learning framework or should you build one from scratch? In this paper, we share our practical experiences of building an embedded inference engine using ARM Compute Library (ACL). The results show that, contradictory to conventional wisdoms, for simple models, it takes much less development time to build an inference engine from scratch compared to porting existing frameworks. In addition, by utilizing ACL, we managed to build an inference engine that outperforms TensorFlow by 25%. Our conclusion is that, on embedded devices, we most likely will use very simple deep learning models for inference, and with well-developed building blocks such as ACL, it may be better in both performance and development time to build the engine from scratch.

input: So-called combined approaches answer a conjunctive query over a description logic ontology in three steps: first, they materialise certain consequences of the ontology and the data; second, they evaluate the query over the data; and third, they filter the result of the second phase to eliminate unsound answers. Such approaches were developed for various members of the DL-Lite and the EL families of languages, but none of them can handle ontologies containing nominals. In our work, we bridge this gap and present a combined query answering approach for ELHO ⊥—a logic that contains all features of the OWL 2 EL standard apart from transitive roles and complex role inclusions. This extension is nontrivial because nominals require equality reasoning, which introduces complexity into the first and the third step. Our empirical evaluation suggests that our technique is suitable for practical application, and so it provides a practical basis for conjunctive query answering in a large fragment of OWL 2 EL.

input: Despite the prevalence of collaborative filtering in recommendation systems, there has been little theoretical development on why and how well it works, especially in the “online” setting, where items are recommended to users over time. We address this theoretical gap by introducing a model for online recommendation systems, cast item recommendation under the model as a learning problem, and analyze the performance of a cosine-similarity collaborative filtering method. In our model, each of n users either likes or dislikes each of m items. We assume there to be k types of users, and all the users of a given type share a common string of probabilities determining the chance of liking each item. At each time step, we recommend an item to each user, where a key distinction from related bandit literature is that once a user consumes an item (e.g., watches a movie), then that item cannot be recommended to the same user again. The goal is to maximize the number of likable items recommended to users over time. Our main result establishes that after nearly log(km) initial learning time steps, a simple collaborative filtering algorithm achieves essentially optimal performance without knowing k. The algorithm has an exploitation step that uses cosine similarity and two types of exploration steps, one to explore the space of items (standard in the literature) and the other to explore similarity between users (novel to this work).
