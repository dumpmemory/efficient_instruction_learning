input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

input: How do news sources tackle controversial issues? In this work, we take a data-driven approach to understand how controversy interplays with emotional expression and biased language in the news. We begin by introducing a new dataset of controversial and noncontroversial terms collected using crowdsourcing. Then, focusing on 15 major U.S. news outlets, we compare millions of articles discussing controversial and non-controversial issues over a span of 7 months. We find that in general, when it comes to controversial issues, the use of negative affect and biased language is prevalent, while the use of strong emotion is tempered. We also observe many differences across news sources. Using these findings, we show that we can indicate to what extent an issue is controversial, by comparing it with other issues in terms of how they are portrayed across different media.

input: Due to the intractable nature of exact lifted inference, research has recently focused on the discovery of accurate and efficient approximate inference algorithms in Statistical Relational Models (SRMs), such as Lifted First-Order Belief Propagation. FOBP simulates propositional factor graph belief propagation without constructing the ground factor graph by identifying and lifting over redundant message computations. In this work, we propose a generalization of FOBP called Lifted Generalized Belief Propagation, in which both the region structure and the message structure can be lifted. This approach allows more of the inference to be performed intra-region (in the exact inference step of BP), thereby allowing simulation of propagation on a graph structure with larger region scopes and fewer edges, while still maintaining tractability. We demonstrate that the resulting algorithm converges in fewer iterations to more accurate results on a variety of SRMs.

input: In last few years there are major changes and evolution has been done on classification of data. As the application area of technology is increases the size of data also increases. Classification of data becomes difficult because of unbounded size and imbalance nature of data. Class imbalance problem become greatest issue in data mining. Imbalance problem occur where one of the two classes having more sample than other classes. The most of algorithm are more focusing on classification of major sample while ignoring or misclassifying minority sample. The minority samples are those that rarely occur but very important. There are different methods available for classification of imbalance data set which is divided into three main categories, the algorithmic approach, datapreprocessing approach and feature selection approach. Each of this technique has their own advantages and disadvantages. In this paper systematic study of each approach is define which gives the right direction for research in class imbalance problem.

input: Words in natural language follow a Zipfian distribution whereby some words are frequent but most are rare. Learning representations for words in the “long tail” of this distribution requires enormous amounts of data. Representations of rare words trained directly on end-tasks are usually poor, requiring us to pre-train embeddings on external data, or treat all rare words as out-of-vocabulary words with a unique representation. We provide a method for predicting embeddings of rare words on the fly from small amounts of auxiliary data with a network trained against the end task. We show that this improves results against baselines where embeddings are trained on the end task in a reading comprehension task, a recognizing textual entailment task, and in language modelling.

input: Replacing a portion of current light duty vehicles (LDV) with plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) offers the possibility to reduce the dependence on petroleum fuels together with environmental and economic benefits. The charging activity of PHEVs will certainly introduce new load to the power grid. In the framework of the development of a smarter grid, the primary focus of the present study is to propose a model for the electrical daily demand in presence of PHEVs charging. Expected PHEV demand is modeled by the PHEV charging time and the starting time of charge according to real world data. A normal distribution for starting time of charge is assumed. Several distributions for charging time are considered: uniform distribution, Gaussian with positive support, Rician distribution and a non-uniform distribution coming from driving patterns in real-world data. We generate daily demand profiles by using real-world residential profiles throughout 2014 in the presence of different expected PHEV demand models. Support vector machines (SVMs), a set of supervised machine learning models, are employed in order to find the best model to fit the data. SVMs with radial basis function (RBF) and polynomial kernels were tested. Model performances are evaluated by means of mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Best results are obtained with RBF kernel: maximum (worst) values for MSE and MAPE were about 2.89 10 and 0.023, respectively. Keywords—Energy demand, plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), smart grids, support vector machines.

We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset.

input: Multimedia or spoken content presents more attractive information than plain text content, but it’s more difficult to display on a screen and be selected by a user. As a result, accessing large collections of the former is much more difficult and time-consuming than the latter for humans. It’s highly attractive to develop a machine which can automatically understand spoken content and summarize the key information for humans to browse over. In this endeavor, we propose a new task of machine comprehension of spoken content. We define the initial goal as the listening comprehension test of TOEFL, a challenging academic English examination for English learners whose native language is not English. We further propose an Attention-based Multi-hop Recurrent Neural Network (AMRNN) architecture for this task, achieving encouraging results in the initial tests. Initial results also have shown that word-level attention is probably more robust than sentence-level attention for this task with ASR errors.

input: The efficiency of inference in both the Hugin and, most notably, the Shafer-Shenoy archi­ tectures can be improved by exploiting the independence relations induced by the incom­ ing messages of a clique. That is, the mes­ sage to be sent from a clique can be com­ puted via a factorization of the clique poten­ tial in the form of a junction tree. In this pa­ per we show that by exploiting such nested junction trees in the computation of messages both space and time costs of the conventional propagation methods may be reduced. The paper presents a structured way of exploit­ ing the nested junction trees technique to achieve such reductions. The usefulness of the method is emphasized through a thor­ ough empirical evaluation involving ten large real-world Bayesian networks and the Hugin inference algorithm.

input: Mobile edge computing (a.k.a. fog computing) has recently emerged to enable in-situ processing of delay-sensitive applications at the edge of mobile networks. Providing grid power supply in support of mobile edge computing, however, is costly and even infeasible (in certain rugged or under-developed areas), thus mandating on-site renewable energy as a major or even sole power supply in increasingly many scenarios. Nonetheless, the high intermittency and unpredictability of renewable energy make it very challenging to deliver a high quality of service to users in energy harvesting mobile edge computing systems. In this paper, we address the challenge of incorporating renewables into mobile edge computing and propose an efficient reinforcement learning-based resource management algorithm, which learns on-the-fly the optimal policy of dynamic workload offloading (to the centralized cloud) and edge server provisioning to minimize the long-term system cost (including both service delay and operational cost). Our online learning algorithm uses a decomposition of the (offline) value iteration and (online) reinforcement learning, thus achieving a significant improvement of learning rate and runtime performance when compared to standard reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning. We prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm and analytically show that the learned policy has a simple monotone structure amenable to practical implementation. Our simulation results validate the efficacy of our algorithm, which significantly improves the edge computing performance compared to fixed or myopic optimization schemes and conventional reinforcement learning algorithms.

input: There is a vast amount of unstructured Arabic information on the Web, this data is always organized in semi-structured text and cannot be used directly. This research proposes a semi-supervised technique that extracts binary relations between two Arabic named entities from the Web. Several works have been performed for relation extraction from Latin texts and as far as we know, there isn’t any work for Arabic text using a semi-supervised technique. The goal of this research is to extract a large list or table from named entities and relations in a specific domain. A small set of a handful of instance relations are required as input from the user. The system exploits summaries from Google search engine as a source text. These instances are used to extract patterns. The output is a set of new entities and their relations. The results from four experiments show that precision and recall varies according to relation type. Precision ranges from 0.61 to 0.75 while recall ranges from 0.71 to 0.83. The best result is obtained for (player, club) relationship, 0.72 and 0.83 for precision and recall respectively.

input: We discuss relations between Residual Networks (ResNet), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and the primate visual cortex. We begin with the observation that a shallow RNN is exactly equivalent to a very deep ResNet with weight sharing among the layers. A direct implementation of such a RNN, although having orders of magnitude fewer parameters, leads to a performance similar to the corresponding ResNet. We propose 1) a generalization of both RNN and ResNet architectures and 2) the conjecture that a class of moderately deep RNNs is a biologically-plausible model of the ventral stream in visual cortex. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the architectures by testing them on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

input: Despite recent advances, the remaining bottlenecks in deep generative models are necessity of extensive training and difficulties with generalization from small number of training examples. Both problems may be addressed by conditional generative models that are trained to adapt the generative distribution to additional input data. So far this idea was explored only under certain limitations such as restricting the input data to be a single object or multiple objects representing the same concept. In this work we develop a new class of deep generative model called generative matching networks which is inspired by the recently proposed matching networks for one-shot learning in discriminative tasks and the ideas from meta-learning. By conditioning on the additional input dataset, generative matching networks may instantly learn new concepts that were not available during the training but conform to a similar generative process, without explicit limitations on the number of additional input objects or the number of concepts they represent. Our experiments on the Omniglot dataset demonstrate that generative matching networks can significantly improve predictive performance on the fly as more additional data is available to the model and also adapt the latent space which is beneficial in the context of feature extraction.

These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

Now complete the following example-
input: We propose k-means, a new clustering method which efficiently copes with large numbers of clusters and achieves low energy solutions. k-means builds upon the standard k-means (Lloyd’s algorithm) and combines a new strategy to accelerate the convergence with a new low time complexity divisive initialization. The accelerated convergence is achieved through only looking at kn nearest clusters and using triangle inequality bounds in the assignment step while the divisive initialization employs an optimal 2-clustering along a direction. The worst-case time complexity per iteration of our k-means is O(nknd+ kd), where d is the dimension of the n data points and k is the number of clusters and usually n k kn. Compared to k-means’ O(nkd) complexity, our k-means complexity is significantly lower, at the expense of slightly increasing the memory complexity by O(nkn + k). In our extensive experiments k-means is order(s) of magnitude faster than standard methods in computing accurate clusterings on several standard datasets and settings with hundreds of clusters and high dimensional data. Moreover, the proposed divisive initialization generally leads to clustering energies comparable to those achieved with the standard k-means++ initialization, while being significantly faster.

input: We investigate evaluation metrics for endto-end dialogue systems where supervised labels, such as task completion, are not available. Recent works in end-to-end dialogue systems have adopted metrics from machine translation and text summarization to compare a model’s generated response to a single target response. We show that these metrics correlate very weakly or not at all with human judgements of the response quality in both technical and non-technical domains. We provide quantitative and qualitative results highlighting specific weaknesses in existing metrics, and provide recommendations for future development of better automatic evaluation metrics for dialogue systems.

input: Eliminating the negative effect of highly non-stationary environmental noise is a long-standing research topic for speech recognition but remains an important challenge nowadays. To address this issue, traditional unsupervised signal processing methods seem to have touched the ceiling. However, data-driven based supervised approaches, particularly the ones designed with deep learning, have recently emerged as potential alternatives. In this light, we are going to comprehensively summarise the recently developed and most representative deep learning approaches to deal with the raised problem in this article, with the aim of providing guidelines for those who are going deeply into the field of environmentally robust speech recognition. To better introduce these approaches, we categorise them into singleand multi-channel techniques, each of which is specifically described at the front-end, the back-end, and the joint framework of speech recognition systems. In the meanwhile, we describe the pros and cons of these approaches as well as the relationships among them, which can probably benefit future research.

In this study, we build NMT systems using only synthetic parallel data. As an efficient alternative to real parallel data, we also present a new type of synthetic parallel corpus. The proposed pseudo parallel data are distinct from previous works in that ground truth and synthetic examples are mixed on both sides of sentence pairs. Experiments on Czech-German and French-German translations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed pseudo parallel corpus, which shows not only enhanced results for bidirectional translation tasks but also substantial improvement with the aid of a ground truth real parallel corpus.

Automated Driving (AD) has potential to drastically reduce such accidents. In this work, we focus on the technical challenges that arise from AD in urban environments. We present the overall architecture of an AD system and describe in detail the perception and planning modules. The AD system, built on a modified Acura RLX, was demonstrated in a course in GoMentum Station in California. We demonstrated autonomous handling of 4 scenarios: traffic lights, cross-traffic at intersections, construction zones and pedestrians. The AD vehicle displayed safe behavior and performed consistently in repeated demonstrations with slight variations in conditions. Overall, we completed 44 runs, encompassing 110km of automated driving with only 3 cases where the driver intervened the control of the vehicle, mostly due to error in GPS positioning. Our demonstration showed that robust and consistent behavior in urban scenarios is possible, yet more investigation is necessary for full scale rollout on public roads.

input: We propose a local coherence model based on a convolutional neural network that operates over the entity grid representation of a text. The model captures long range entity transitions along with entity-specific features without loosing generalization, thanks to the power of distributed representation. We present a pairwise ranking method to train the model in an end-to-end fashion on a task and learn task-specific high level features. Our evaluation on three different coherence assessment tasks demonstrates that our model achieves state of the art results outperforming existing models by a good margin.

Positive example 2-
input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

Now complete the following example-
input: Bio-inspired optimization algorithms have been gaining more popularity recently. One of the most important of these algorithms is particle swarm optimization (PSO). PSO is based on the collective intelligence of a swam of particles. Each particle explores a part of the search space looking for the optimal position and adjusts its position according to two factors; the first is its own experience and the second is the collective experience of the whole swarm. PSO has been successfully used to solve many optimization problems. In this work we use PSO to improve the performance of a well-known representation method of time series data which is the symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX). As with other time series representation methods, SAX results in loss of information when applied to represent time series. In this paper we use PSO to propose a new minimum distance WMD for SAX to remedy this problem. Unlike the original minimum distance, the new distance sets different weights to different segments of the time series according to their information content. This weighted minimum distance enhances the performance of SAX as we show through experiments using different time series datasets.

Now complete the following example-
input: N-tuple networks have been successfully used as position evaluation functions for board games such as Othello or Connect Four. The effectiveness of such networks depends on their architecture, which is determined by the placement of constituent n-tuples, sequences of board locations, providing input to the network. The most popular method of placing ntuples consists in randomly generating a small number of long, snake-shaped board location sequences. In comparison, we show that learning n-tuple networks is significantly more effective if they involve a large number of systematically placed, short, straight n-tuples. Moreover, we demonstrate that in order to obtain the best performance and the steepest learning curve for Othello it is enough to use n-tuples of size just 2, yielding a network consisting of only 288 weights. The best such network evolved in this study has been evaluated in the online Othello League, obtaining the performance of nearly 96% — more than any other player to date.
