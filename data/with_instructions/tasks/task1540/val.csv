input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

input: Humans comprehend the meanings and relations of discourses heavily relying on their semantic memory that encodes general knowledge about concepts and facts. Inspired by this, we propose a neural recognizer for implicit discourse relation analysis, which builds upon a semantic memory that stores knowledge in a distributed fashion. We refer to this recognizer as SeMDER. Starting from word embeddings of discourse arguments, SeMDER employs a shallow encoder to generate a distributed surface representation for a discourse. A semantic encoder with attention to the semantic memory matrix is further established over surface representations. It is able to retrieve a deep semantic meaning representation for the discourse from the memory. Using the surface and semantic representations as input, SeMDER finally predicts implicit discourse relations via a neural recognizer. Experiments on the benchmark data set show that SeMDER benefits from the semantic memory and achieves substantial improvements of 2.56% on average over current state-of-the-art baselines in terms of F1-score.

input: Pretraining is widely used in deep neutral network and one of the most famous pretraining models is Deep Belief Network (DBN). The optimization formulas are different during the pretraining process for different pretraining models. In this paper, we pretrained deep neutral network by different pretraining models and hence investigated the difference between DBN and Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDA) when used as pretraining model. The experimental results show that DBN get a better initial model. However the model converges to a relatively worse model after the finetuning process. Yet after pretrained by SDA for the second time the model converges to a better model if finetuned.

The main achievement of the paper is useful features of some universal exploiters proof, which allow extending set of basic classes and set of basic relations by finite set of new classes of objects and relations among them, which allow creating of complete lattice. Proposed approach gives an opportunity to compute quantity of new classes, which can be generated using it, and quantity of different types, which each of obtained classes describes; constructing of defined hierarchy of classes with determined subsumption relation; avoidance of some problems of inheritance and more efficient restoring of basic knowledge within the database.

input: This paper proposes a new model for extracting an interpretable sentence embedding by introducing self-attention. Instead of using a vector, we use a 2-D matrix to represent the embedding, with each row of the matrix attending on a different part of the sentence. We also propose a self-attention mechanism and a special regularization term for the model. As a side effect, the embedding comes with an easy way of visualizing what specific parts of the sentence are encoded into the embedding. We evaluate our model on 3 different tasks: author profiling, sentiment classification and textual entailment. Results show that our model yields a significant performance gain compared to other sentence embedding methods in all of the 3 tasks.

input: Recently, attempts have been made to remove Gaussian mixture models (GMM) from the training process of deep neural network-based hidden Markov models (HMM/DNN). For the GMM-free training of a HMM/DNN hybrid we have to solve two problems, namely the initial alignment of the frame-level state labels and the creation of context-dependent states. Although flat-start training via iteratively realigning and retraining the DNN using a frame-level error function is viable, it is quite cumbersome. Here, we propose to use a sequencediscriminative training criterion for flat start. While sequencediscriminative training is routinely applied only in the final phase of model training, we show that with proper caution it is also suitable for getting an alignment of context-independent DNN models. For the construction of tied states we apply a recently proposed KL-divergence-based state clustering method, hence our whole training process is GMM-free. In the experimental evaluation we found that the sequence-discriminative flat start training method is not only significantly faster than the straightforward approach of iterative retraining and realignment, but the word error rates attained are slightly better as well.

input: We consider the question of extending propositional logic to a logic of plausible reasoning, and posit four requirements that any such extension should satisfy. Each is a requirement that some property of classical propositional logic be preserved in the extended logic; as such, the requirements are simpler and less problematic than those used in Cox’s Theorem and its variants. As with Cox’s Theorem, our requirements imply that the extended logic must be isomorphic to (finite-set) probability theory. We also obtain specific numerical values for the probabilities, recovering the classical definition of probability as a theorem, with truth assignments that satisfy the premise playing the role of the “possible cases.”

This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

input: There are many declarative frameworks that allow us to implement code formatters relatively easily for any specific language, but constructing them is cumbersome. The first problem is that “everybody” wants to format their code differently, leading to either many formatter variants or a ridiculous number of configuration options. Second, the size of each implementation scales with a language’s grammar size, leading to hundreds of rules. In this paper, we solve the formatter construction problem using a novel approach, one that automatically derives formatters for any given language without intervention from a language expert. We introduce a code formatter called CODEBUFF that uses machine learning to abstract formatting rules from a representative corpus, using a carefully designed feature set. Our experiments on Java, SQL, and ANTLR grammars show that CODEBUFF is efficient, has excellent accuracy, and is grammar invariant for a given language. It also generalizes to a 4th language tested during manuscript preparation.

Positive example 1-
input: We propose a local coherence model based on a convolutional neural network that operates over the entity grid representation of a text. The model captures long range entity transitions along with entity-specific features without loosing generalization, thanks to the power of distributed representation. We present a pairwise ranking method to train the model in an end-to-end fashion on a task and learn task-specific high level features. Our evaluation on three different coherence assessment tasks demonstrates that our model achieves state of the art results outperforming existing models by a good margin.

Positive example 2-
input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane.

input: In this paper we present a novel iterative multiphase clustering technique for efficiently clustering high dimensional data points. For this purpose we implement clustering feature (CF) tree on a real data set and a Gaussian density distribution constraint on the resultant CF tree. The post processing by the application of Gaussian density distribution function on the micro-clusters leads to refinement of the previously formed clusters thus improving their quality. This algorithm also succeeds in overcoming the inherent drawbacks of conventional hierarchical methods of clustering like inability to undo the change made to the dendogram of the data points. Moreover, the constraint measure applied in the algorithm makes this clustering technique suitable for need driven data analysis. We provide veracity of our claim by evaluating our algorithm with other similar clustering algorithms.
