input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

input: We adress the problem of dueling bandits defined on partially ordered sets, or posets. In this setting, arms may not be comparable, and there may be several (incomparable) optimal arms. We propose an algorithm, UnchainedBandits, that efficiently finds the set of optimal arms of any poset even when pairs of comparable arms cannot be distinguished from pairs of incomparable arms, with a set of minimal assumptions. This algorithm relies on the concept of decoys, which stems from social psychology. For the easier case where the incomparability information may be accessible, we propose a second algorithm, SlicingBandits, which takes advantage of this information and achieves a very significant gain of performance compared to UnchainedBandits. We provide theoretical guarantees and experimental evaluation for both algorithms.

input: We present a new model for prediction markets, in which we use risk measures to model agents and introduce a market maker to describe the trading process. This specific choice on modelling tools brings us mathematical convenience. The analysis shows that the whole market effectively approaches a global objective, despite that the market is designed such that each agent only cares about its own goal. Additionally, the market dynamics provides a sensible algorithm for optimising the global objective. An intimate connection between machine learning and our markets is thus established, such that we could 1) analyse a market by applying machine learning methods to the global objective, and 2) solve machine learning problems by setting up and running certain markets.

input: Recently deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used to learn speaker features. However, the quality of the learned features is not sufficiently good, so a complex back-end model, either neural or probabilistic, has to be used to address the residual uncertainty when applied to speaker verification, just as with raw features. This paper presents a convolutional timedelay deep neural network structure (CT-DNN) for speaker feature learning. Our experimental results on the Fisher database demonstrated that this CT-DNN can produce highquality speaker features: even with a single feature (0.3 seconds including the context), the EER can be as low as 7.68%. This effectively confirmed that the speaker trait is largely a deterministic short-time property rather than a long-time distributional pattern, and therefore can be extracted from just dozens of frames.

input: Syllogism is a type of deductive reasoning involving quantified statements. The syllogistic reasoning scheme in the classical Aristotelian framework involves three crisp term sets and four linguistic quantifiers, for which the main support is the linguistic properties of the quantifiers. A number of fuzzy approaches for defining an approximate syllogism have been proposed for which the main support is cardinality calculus. In this paper we analyze fuzzy syllogistic models previously described by Zadeh and Dubois et al. and compare their behavior with that of the classical Aristotelian framework to check which of the 24 classical valid syllogistic reasoning patterns (called moods) are particular crisp cases of these fuzzy approaches. This allows us to assess to what extent these approaches can be considered as either plausible extensions of the classical crisp syllogism or a basis for a general approach to the problem of approximate syllogism.

input: The family of temporal difference (TD) methods span a spectrum from computationally frugal linear methods like TD(λ) to data efficient least squares methods. Least square methods make the best use of available data directly computing the TD solution and thus do not require tuning a typically highly sensitive learning rate parameter, but require quadratic computation and storage. Recent algorithmic developments have yielded several sub-quadratic methods that use an approximation to the least squares TD solution, but incur bias. In this paper, we propose a new family of accelerated gradient TD (ATD) methods that (1) provide similar data efficiency benefits to least-squares methods, at a fraction of the computation and storage (2) significantly reduce parameter sensitivity compared to linear TD methods, and (3) are asymptotically unbiased. We illustrate these claims with a proof of convergence in expectation and experiments on several benchmark domains and a large-scale industrial energy allocation domain.

input: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) on Electronic Health Records (EHR) data is widely-used for early detection of diseases. Classical LDA for EHR data classification, however, suffers from two handicaps: the ill-posed estimation of LDA parameters (e.g., covariance matrix), and the “linear inseparability” of EHR data. To handle these two issues, in this paper, we propose a novel classifier FWDA — Fast Wishart Discriminant Analysis, that makes predictions in an ensemble way. Specifically, FWDA first surrogates the distribution of inverse covariance matrices using a Wishart distribution estimated from the training data, then “weightedaverages” the classification results of multiple LDA classifiers parameterized by the sampled inverse covariance matrices via a Bayesian Voting scheme. The weights for voting are optimally updated to adapt each new input data, so as to enable the nonlinear classification. Theoretical analysis indicates that FWDA possesses a fast convergence rate and a robust performance on high dimensional data. Extensive experiments on large-scale EHR dataset show that our approach outperforms stateof-the-art algorithms by a large margin.

input: We propose a method for learning expressive energy-based policies for continuous states and actions, which has been feasible only in tabular domains before. We apply our method to learning maximum entropy policies, resulting into a new algorithm, called soft Q-learning, that expresses the optimal policy via a Boltzmann distribution. We use the recently proposed amortized Stein variational gradient descent to learn a stochastic sampling network that approximates samples from this distribution. The benefits of the proposed algorithm include improved exploration and compositionality that allows transferring skills between tasks, which we confirm in simulated experiments with swimming and walking robots. We also draw a connection to actorcritic methods, which can be viewed performing approximate inference on the corresponding energy-based model.

input: Colorization of grayscale images has been a hot topic in computer vision. Previous research mainly focuses on producing a colored image to match the original one. However, since many colors share the same gray value, an input grayscale image could be diversely colored while maintaining its reality. In this paper, we design a novel solution for unsupervised diverse colorization. Specifically, we leverage conditional generative adversarial networks to model the distribution of real-world item colors, in which we develop a fully convolutional generator with multi-layer noise to enhance diversity, with multi-layer condition concatenation to maintain reality, and with stride 1 to keep spatial information. With such a novel network architecture, the model yields highly competitive performance on the open LSUN bedroom dataset. The Turing test of 80 humans further indicates our generated color schemes are highly convincible.

input: This paper tests the hypothesis that distinctive feature classifiers anchored at phonetic landmarks can be transferred crosslingually without loss of accuracy. Three consonant voicing classifiers were developed: (1) manually selected acoustic features anchored at a phonetic landmark, (2) MFCCs (either averaged across the segment or anchored at the landmark), and (3) acoustic features computed using a convolutional neural network (CNN). All detectors are trained on English data (TIMIT), and tested on English, Turkish, and Spanish (performance measured using F1 and accuracy). Experiments demonstrate that manual features outperform all MFCC classifiers, while CNN features outperform both. MFCC-based classifiers suffer an overall error rate increase of up to 96.1% when generalized from English to other languages. Manual features suffer only an up to 35.2% relative error rate increase, and CNN features actually perform the best on Turkish and Spanish, demonstrating that features capable of representing long-term spectral dynamics (CNN and landmark-based features) are able to generalize cross-lingually with little or no loss of accuracy.

Current tests of machine comprehension pose questions whose answers can be inferred from some supporting text, and evaluate a model’s response to the questions. The EpiReader is an end-to-end neural model comprising two components: the first component proposes a small set of candidate answers after comparing a question to its supporting text, and the second component formulates hypotheses using the proposed candidates and the question, then reranks the hypotheses based on their estimated concordance with the supporting text. We present experiments demonstrating that the EpiReader sets a new state-of-the-art on the CNN and Children’s Book Test machine comprehension benchmarks, outperforming previous neural models by a significant margin.

More specifically, we propose a skip-thought neighbor model to consider the adjacent sentences as a neighborhood. We train our skip-thought neighbor model on a large corpus with continuous sentences, and then evaluate the trained model on 7 tasks, which include semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, and classification benchmarks. Both quantitative comparison and qualitative investigation are conducted. We empirically show that, our skip-thought neighbor model performs as well as the skip-thought model on evaluation tasks. In addition, we found that, incorporating an autoencoder path in our model didn’t aid our model to perform better, while it hurts the performance of the skip-thought model.

input: As a general and thus popular model for autonomous systems, partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) can capture uncertainties from different sources like sensing noises, actuation errors, and uncertain environments. However, its comprehensiveness makes the planning and control in POMDP difficult. Traditional POMDP planning problems target to find the optimal policy to maximize the expectation of accumulated rewards. But for safety critical applications, guarantees of system performance described by formal specifications are desired, which motivates us to consider formal methods to synthesize supervisor for POMDP. With system specifications given by Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL), we propose a supervisory control framework with a type of deterministic finite automata (DFA), za-DFA, as the controller form. While the existing work mainly relies on optimization techniques to learn fixed-size finite state controllers (FSCs), we develop an L∗ learning based algorithm to determine both space and transitions of za-DFA. Membership queries and different oracles for conjectures are defined. The learning algorithm is sound and complete. An example is given in detailed steps to illustrate the supervisor synthesis algorithm.

input: In this paper, we propose ELF, an Extensive, Lightweight and Flexible platform for fundamental reinforcement learning research. Using ELF, we implement a highly customizable real-time strategy (RTS) engine with three game environments (Mini-RTS, Capture the Flag and Tower Defense). Mini-RTS, as a miniature version of StarCraft, captures key game dynamics and runs at 40K frame-persecond (FPS) per core on a Macbook Pro notebook. When coupled with modern reinforcement learning methods, the system can train a full-game bot against builtin AIs end-to-end in one day with 6 CPUs and 1 GPU. In addition, our platform is flexible in terms of environment-agent communication topologies, choices of RL methods, changes in game parameters, and can host existing C/C++-based game environments like ALE [4]. Using ELF, we thoroughly explore training parameters and show that a network with Leaky ReLU [16] and Batch Normalization [10] coupled with long-horizon training and progressive curriculum beats the rule-based built-in AI more than 70% of the time in the full game of Mini-RTS. Strong performance is also achieved on the other two games. In game replays, we show our agents learn interesting strategies. ELF, along with its RL platform, will be open-sourced.

input: We show a new lower bound on the sample complexity of (ε,δ)-differentially private algorithms that accurately answer statistical queries on high-dimensional databases. The novelty of our bound is that it depends optimally on the parameter δ, which loosely corresponds to the probability that the algorithm fails to be private, and is the first to smoothly interpolate between approximate differential privacy (δ > 0) and pure differential privacy (δ = 0). Specifically, we consider a database D ∈ {±1}n×d and its one-way marginals, which are the d queries of the form “What fraction of individual records have the i-th bit set to +1?” We show that in order to answer all of these queries to within error ±α (on average) while satisfying (ε,δ)-differential privacy, it is necessary that n ≥Ω √d log(1/δ) αε  , which is optimal up to constant factors. To prove our lower bound, we build on the connection between fingerprinting codes and lower bounds in differential privacy (Bun, Ullman, and Vadhan, STOC’14). In addition to our lower bound, we give new purely and approximately differentially private algorithms for answering arbitrary statistical queries that improve on the sample complexity of the standard Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms for achieving worst-case accuracy guarantees by a logarithmic factor. ∗Harvard University School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

input: We describe here a methodology to identify a list of ambiguous Malay words that are commonly being used in Malay documentations such as Requirement Specification. We compiled several relevant and appropriate requirement quality attributes and sentence rules from previous literatures and adopt it to come out with a set of ambiguity attributes that most suit Malay words. The extracted Malay ambiguous words (potential) are then being mapped onto the constructed ambiguity attributes to confirm their vagueness. The list is then verified by Malay linguist experts. This paper aims to identify a list of potential ambiguous words in Malay as an attempt to assist writers to avoid using the vague words while documenting Malay Requirement Specification as well as to any other related Malay documentation. The result of this study is a list of 120 potential ambiguous Malay words that could act as guidelines in writing Malay sentences.

input: The rapid growth of emerging information technologies and application patterns in modern society, e.g., Internet, Internet of Things, Cloud Computing and Tri-network Convergence, has caused the advent of the era of big data. Big data contains huge values, however, mining knowledge from big data is a tremendously challenging task because of data uncertainty and inconsistency. Attribute reduction (also known as feature selection) can not only be used as an effective preprocessing step, but also exploits the data redundancy to reduce the uncertainty. However, existing solutions are designed 1) either for a single machine that means the entire data must fit in the main memory and the parallelism is limited; 2) or for the Hadoop platform which means that the data have to be loaded into the distributed memory frequently and therefore become inefficient. In this paper, we overcome these shortcomings for maximum efficiency possible, and propose a unified framework for Parallel Large-scale Attribute Reduction, termed PLAR, for big data analysis. PLAR consists of three components: 1) Granular Computing (GrC)-based initialization: it converts a decision table (i.e. original data representation) into a granularity representation which reduces the amount of space and hence can be easily cached in the distributed memory: 2) model-parallelism: it simultaneously evaluates all feature candidates and makes attribute reduction highly parallelizable; 3) dataparallelism: it computes the significance of an attribute in parallel using a MapReduce-style manner. We implement PLAR with four representative heuristic feature selection algorithms on SPARK, and evaluate them on various huge datasets, including UCI and astronomical datasets, finding our method’s advantages beyond existing solutions.

input: Decentralized POMDPs provide an expressive framework for multi-agent sequential decision making. While finite-horizon DECPOMDPs have enjoyed significant success, progress remains slow for the infinite-horizon case mainly due to the inherent complexity of optimizing stochastic controllers representing agent policies. We present a promising new class of algorithms for the infinite-horizon case, which recasts the optimization problem as inference in a mixture of DBNs. An attractive feature of this approach is the straightforward adoption of existing inference techniques in DBNs for solving DEC-POMDPs and supporting richer representations such as factored or continuous states and actions. We also derive the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to optimize the joint policy represented as DBNs. Experiments on benchmark domains show that EM compares favorably against the state-of-the-art solvers.

input: Vector space models have become popular in distributional semantics, despite the challenges they face in capturing various semantic phenomena. We propose a novel probabilistic framework which draws on both formal semantics and recent advances in machine learning. In particular, we separate predicates from the entities they refer to, allowing us to perform Bayesian inference based on logical forms. We describe an implementation of this framework using a combination of Restricted Boltzmann Machines and feedforward neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by training it on a parsed corpus and evaluating it on established similarity datasets.

input: The AGM theory of belief revision has be­ come an important paradigm for investigat­ ing rational belief changes. Unfortunately, researchers working in this paradigm have re­ stricted much of their attention to rather sim­ ple representations of belief states, namely logically closed sets of propositional sen­ tences. In our opinion, this has resulted in a too abstract categorisation of belief change operations: expansion, revision, or contrac­ tion. Occasionally, in the AGM paradigm, also probabilistic belief changes have been considered, and it is widely accepted that the probabilistic version of expansion is con­ ditioning. However, we argue that it may be more correct to view conditioning and expan­ sion as two essentially different kinds of belief change, and that what we call constraining is a better candidate for being considered prob­ abilistic expansion.

Our model embeds object and action concepts as well as other available modalities from videos into a distributional semantic space. To our knowledge, this is the first Zero-Shot event detection model that is built on top of distributional semantics and extends it in the following directions: (a) semantic embedding of multimodal information in videos (with focus on the visual modalities), (b) automatically determining relevance of concepts/attributes to a free text query, which could be useful for other applications, and (c) retrieving videos by free text event query (e.g., ”changing a vehicle tire”) based on their content. We embed videos into a distributional semantic space and then measure the similarity between videos and the event query in a free text form. We validated our method on the large TRECVID MED (Multimedia Event Detection) challenge. Using only the event title as a query, our method outperformed the state-of-the-art that uses big descriptions from 12.6% to 13.5% with MAP metric and 0.73 to 0.83 with ROC-AUC metric.

input: This paper develops upper and lower bounds for the probability of Boolean functions by treating multiple occurrences of variables as independent and assigning them new individual probabilities. We call this approach dissociation and give an exact characterization of optimal oblivious bounds, i.e. when the new probabilities are chosen independent of the probabilities of all other variables. Our motivation comes from the weighted model counting problem (or, equivalently, the problem of computing the probability of a Boolean function), which is #P-hard in general. By performing several dissociations, one can transform a Boolean formula whose probability is difficult to compute, into one whose probability is easy to compute, and which is guaranteed to provide an upper or lower bound on the probability of the original formula by choosing appropriate probabilities for the dissociated variables. Our new bounds shed light on the connection between previous relaxation-based and model-based approximations and unify them as concrete choices in a larger design space. We also show how our theory allows a standard relational database management system (DBMS) to both upper and lower bound hard probabilistic queries in guaranteed polynomial time.

input: In the fashion industry, order scheduling focuses on the assignment of production orders to appropriate production lines. In reality, before a new order can be put into production, a series of activities known as pre-production events need to be completed. In addition, in real production process, owing to various uncertainties, the daily production quantity of each order is not always as expected. In this research, by considering the pre-production events and the uncertainties in the daily production quantity, robust order scheduling problems in the fashion industry are investigated with the aid of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) called nondominated sorting adaptive differential evolution (NSJADE). The experimental results illustrate that it is of paramount importance to consider pre-production events in order scheduling problems in the fashion industry. We also unveil that the existence of the uncertainties in the daily production quantity heavily affects the order scheduling.

input: We provide a systematic analysis of levels of integration between discrete high-level reasoning and continuous low-level reasoning to address hybrid planning problems in robotics. We identify four distinct strategies for such an integration: (i) low-level checks are done for all possible cases in advance and then this information is used during plan generation, (ii) low-level checks are done exactly when they are needed during the search for a plan, (iii) first all plans are computed and then infeasible ones are filtered, and (iv) by means of replanning, after finding a plan, low-level checks identify whether it is infeasible or not; if it is infeasible, a new plan is computed considering the results of previous lowlevel checks. We perform experiments on hybrid planning problems in robotic manipulation and legged locomotion domains considering these four methods of integration, as well as some of their combinations. We analyze the usefulness of levels of integration in these domains, both from the point of view of computational efficiency (in time and space) and from the point of view of plan quality relative to its feasibility. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of each strategy in the light of experimental results and provide some guidelines on choosing proper strategies for a given domain.

input: Neural machine translation (NMT) aims at solving machine translation (MT) problems with purely neural networks and exhibits promising results in recent years. However, most of the existing NMT models are of shallow topology and there is still a performance gap between the single NMT model and the best conventional MT system. In this work, we introduce a new type of linear connections, named fast-forward connections, based on deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, together with the interleaved bidirectional way for stacking them. Fastforward connections play an essential role to propagate the gradients in building the deep topology of depth 16. On WMT’14 Englishto-French task, we achieved BLEU=37.7 with single attention model, which outperforms the corresponding single shallow model by 6.2 BLEU points. It is the first time that a single NMT model achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms the best conventional model by 0.7 BLEU points. Even without considering attention mechanism, we can still achieve BLEU=36.3. After the special handling for unknown words and the model ensembling, we obtained the best score on this task with BLEU=40.4. Our models are also verified on the more difficult WMT’14 English-to-German task.

input: State-space models are successfully used in many areas of science, engineering and economics to model time series and dynamical systems. We present a fully Bayesian approach to inference and learning (i.e. state estimation and system identification) in nonlinear nonparametric state-space models. We place a Gaussian process prior over the state transition dynamics, resulting in a flexible model able to capture complex dynamical phenomena. To enable efficient inference, we marginalize over the transition dynamics function and infer directly the joint smoothing distribution using specially tailored Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers. Once a sample from the smoothing distribution is computed, the state transition predictive distribution can be formulated analytically. Our approach preserves the full nonparametric expressivity of the model and can make use of sparse Gaussian processes to greatly reduce computational complexity.

input: Recent works on word representations mostly rely on predictive models. Distributed word representations (aka word embeddings) are trained to optimally predict the contexts in which the corresponding words tend to appear. Such models have succeeded in capturing word similarities as well as semantic and syntactic regularities. Instead, we aim at reviving interest in a model based on counts. We present a systematic study of the use of the Hellinger distance to extract semantic representations from the word co-occurrence statistics of large text corpora. We show that this distance gives good performance on word similarity and analogy tasks, with a proper type and size of context, and a dimensionality reduction based on a stochastic low-rank approximation. Besides being both simple and intuitive, this method also provides an encoding function which can be used to infer unseen words or phrases. This becomes a clear advantage compared to predictive models which must train these new words.

To test the performances of our models, we conduct the word similarity and syntactic analogy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. Our models beat the comparative baselines on both tasks to a great extent. On the golden standard Wordsim-353 and RG-65, our models approximately outperform CBOW for 5 and 7 percent, respectively. In addition, 7 percent advantage is also achieved by our models on syntactic analysis.

This property of our methods may have some positive effects on NLP researches about the corpus-limited languages.

Now complete the following example-
input: I propose a framework for an agent to change its probabilistic beliefs when a new piece of propositional information α is observed. Traditionally, belief change occurs by either a revision process or by an update process, depending on whether the agent is informed with α in a static world or, respectively, whether α is a ‘signal’ from the environment due to an event occurring. Boutilier suggested a unified model of qualitative belief change, which “combines aspects of revision and update, providing a more realistic characterization of belief change.” In this paper, I propose a unified model of quantitative belief change, where an agent’s beliefs are represented as a probability distribution over possible worlds. As does Boutilier, I take a dynamical systems perspective. The proposed approach is evaluated against several rationality postulated, and some properties of the approach are worked out. Information acquired can be due to evolution of the world or revelation about the world. That is, one may notice via some ‘signal’ generated by the changing environment that the environment has changed, or, one may be informed by an independent agent in a static environment that some ‘fact’ holds. In the present work, I deal with belief change of agents who handle uncertainty by maintaining a probability distribution over possible situations. The agents in this framework also have models for nondeterministic events, and noisy observations. Noisy observation models can model imperfect sensory equipment for receiving environmental signals, but they can also model untrustworthy informants in a static world. In this paper, I provide the work of Boutilier (1998) as background, because it has several connections with and was the seed for the present work. However, I do not intend simply to give a probabilistic version of his Generalized Update Semantics. Whereas Boutilier (1998) presents a model for unifying qualitative belief revision and update, I build on his work to present a unified model of belief revision and update in a stochastic (probabilistic) setting. I also take a dynamical systems perspective, like him. Due to my quantitative approach, an agent can maintain a probability distribution Copyright c © 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. over the worlds it believes possible, using an expectation semantics of change. This is in contrast to Boutilier’s “generalized update” approach, which takes a most-plausible event and most-plausible world approach. Finally, my proposal requires a trade-off factor to mix the changes in probability distribution over possible worlds brought about due to the probabilistic belief revision process and, respectively, the probabilistic belief update process. Boutilier’s model has revision and update more tightly coupled. For this reason, his approach is better called “unified” while mine is called “hybrid”. The belief change community does not study probabilistic belief update; it is studied almost exclusively in frameworks employing Bayesian conditioning – for modeling events and actions in dynamical domains (e.g., DBNs, MDPs, POMDPs) (Koller and Friedman, 2009; Poole and Mackworth, 2010, e.g.). The part of my approach responsible for updating stays within the Bayesian framework, but combines the essential elements of belief update with unobservable events and belief update as partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) state estimation. On the other hand, there is plenty of literature on probabilistic belief revision (Voorbraak, 1999; Grove and Halpern, 1998; Kern-Isberner, 2008; Yue and Liu, 2008, e.g.). The subject is both deep and broad. There is no one accepted approach and to argue which is the best is not the focus of this paper. I shall choose one reasonable method for probabilistic belief revision suitable to the task at hand. In the first section, Boutilier’s ‘generalized update’ is reviewed. Then, in the next section, I introduce stochastic update and stochastic revision, culminating in the ‘hybrid stochastic belief change’ (HSBC) approach. The final section presents an example inspired by Boutilier’s article (1998) and analyses the results. Some proofs of propositions are omitted to save space; they are available on request. Boutilier’s Generalized Update I use Boutilier’s notation and descriptions, except that I am more comfortable with α and β to represent sentences, instead of A and B. It is assumed that an agent has a deductively closed belief set K, a set of sentences drawn from some logical language reflecting the agent’s beliefs about the current state of the world. For ease of presentation, I assume ar X iv :1 60 4. 02 12 6v 1 [ cs .A I] 7 A pr 2 01 6 a logically finite, classical propositional language, denoted L (LCPL in Boutilier (1998)), and consequence operation Cn . The belief set K will often be generated by some finite knowledge base KB (i.e., K = Cn(KB)). The identically true and false propositions are denoted > and ⊥, respectively. Given a set of possible worlds W (or valuations over L) and α ∈ L, the set of α-worlds, that is, the elements of W satisfying α, is denoted by ||α||. The worlds satisfying all sentences in a set K is denoted ||K||.

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

input: Detecting a small number of outliers from a set of data observations is always challenging. This problem is more difficult in the setting of multiple network samples, where computing the anomalous degree of a network sample is generally not sufficient. In fact, explaining why the network is exceptional, expressed in the form of subnetwork, is also equally important. In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm to address these two key problems. We treat each network sample as a potential outlier and identify subnetworks that mostly discriminate it from nearby regular samples. The algorithm is developed in the framework of network regression combined with the constraints on both network topology and L1-norm shrinkage to perform subnetwork discovery. Our method thus goes beyond subspace /subgraph discovery and we show that it converges to a global optimum. Evaluation on various real-world network datasets demonstrates that our algorithm not only outperforms baselines in both network and high dimensional setting, but also discovers highly relevant and interpretable local subnetworks, further enhancing our understanding of anomalous networks.

input: The Gumbel trick is a method to sample from a discrete probability distribution, or to estimate its normalizing partition function. The method relies on repeatedly applying a random perturbation to the distribution in a particular way, each time solving for the most likely configuration. We derive an entire family of related methods, of which the Gumbel trick is one member, and show that the new methods have superior properties in several settings with minimal additional computational cost. In particular, for the Gumbel trick to yield computational benefits for discrete graphical models, Gumbel perturbations on all configurations are typically replaced with socalled low-rank perturbations. We show how a subfamily of our new methods adapts to this setting, proving new upper and lower bounds on the log partition function and deriving a family of sequential samplers for the Gibbs distribution. Finally, we balance the discussion by showing how the simpler analytical form of the Gumbel trick enables additional theoretical results.

We evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf singlevector and multi-sense vector models on a benchmark phrase similarity task and a novel task for word-sense discrimination. We find that single-sense vector models perform as well or better than multi-sense vector models despite arguably less clean elementary representations. Our findings furthermore show that simple composition functions such as pointwise addition are able to recover sense specific information from a single-sense vector model remark-

input: While there has been substantial progress in factoid question-answering (QA), answering complex questions remains challenging, typically requiring both a large body of knowledge and inference techniques. Open Information Extraction (Open IE) provides a way to generate semi-structured knowledge for QA, but to date such knowledge has only been used to answer simple questions with retrievalbased methods. We overcome this limitation by presenting a method for reasoning with Open IE knowledge, allowing more complex questions to be handled. Using a recently proposed support graph optimization framework for QA, we develop a new inference model for Open IE, in particular one that can work effectively with multiple short facts, noise, and the relational structure of tuples. Our model significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art structured solver on complex questions of varying difficulty, while also removing the reliance on manually curated knowledge.

input: Constraint-based causal discovery from limited data is a notoriously difficult challenge due to the many borderline independence test decisions. Several approaches to improve the reliability of the predictions by exploiting redundancy in the independence information have been proposed recently. Though promising, existing approaches can still be greatly improved in terms of accuracy and scalability. We present a novel method that reduces the combinatorial explosion of the search space by using a more coarse-grained representation of causal information, drastically reducing computation time. Additionally, we propose a method to score causal predictions based on their confidence. Crucially, our implementation also allows one to easily combine observational and interventional data and to incorporate various types of available background knowledge. We prove soundness and asymptotic consistency of our method and demonstrate that it can outperform the state-ofthe-art on synthetic data, achieving a speedup of several orders of magnitude. We illustrate its practical feasibility by applying it on a challenging protein data set.

input: We study embedded Binarized Neural Networks (eBNNs) with the aim of allowing current binarized neural networks (BNNs) in the literature to perform feedforward inference efficiently on small embedded devices. We focus on minimizing the required memory footprint, given that these devices often have memory as small as tens of kilobytes (KB). Beyond minimizing the memory required to store weights, as in a BNN, we show that it is essential to minimize the memory used for temporaries which hold intermediate results between layers in feedforward inference. To accomplish this, eBNN reorders the computation of inference while preserving the original BNN structure, and uses just a single floating-point temporary for the entire neural network. All intermediate results from a layer are stored as binary values, as opposed to floating-points used in current BNN implementations, leading to a 32x reduction in required temporary space. We provide empirical evidence that our proposed eBNN approach allows efficient inference (10s of ms) on devices with severely limited memory (10s of KB). For example, eBNN achieves 95% accuracy on the MNIST dataset running on an Intel Curie with only 15 KB of usable memory with an inference runtime of under 50 ms per sample. To ease the development of applications in embedded contexts, we make our source code available that allows users to train and discover eBNN models for a learning task at hand, which fit within the memory constraint of the target device.

input: Inspired by biological vision systems, the over-complete local features with huge cardinality are increasingly used for face recognition during the last decades. Accordingly, feature selection has become more and more important and plays a critical role for face data description and recognition. In this paper, we propose a trainable feature selection algorithm based on the regularized frame for face recognition. By enforcing a sparsity penalty term on the minimum squared error (MSE) criterion, we cast the feature selection problem into a combinatorial sparse approximation problem, which can be solved by greedy methods or convex relaxation methods. Moreover, based on the same frame, we propose a sparse Ho-Kashyap (HK) procedure to obtain simultaneously the optimal sparse solution and the corresponding margin vector of the MSE criterion. The proposed methods are used for selecting the most informative Gabor features of face images for recognition and the experimental results on benchmark face databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations.

input: The Aviation Safety Reporting System collects voluntarily submitted reports on aviation safety incidents to facilitate research work aiming to reduce such incidents. To effectively reduce these incidents, it is vital to accurately identify why these incidents occurred. More precisely, given a set of possible causes, or shaping factors, this task of cause identification involves identifying all and only those shaping factors that are responsible for the incidents described in a report. We investigate two approaches to cause identification. Both approaches exploit information provided by a semantic lexicon, which is automatically constructed via Thelen and Riloff’s Basilisk framework augmented with our linguistic and algorithmic modifications. The first approach labels a report using a simple heuristic, which looks for the words and phrases acquired during the semantic lexicon learning process in the report. The second approach recasts cause identification as a text classification problem, employing supervised and transductive text classification algorithms to learn models from incident reports labeled with shaping factors and using the models to label unseen reports. Our experiments show that both the heuristic-based approach and the learning-based approach (when given sufficient training data) outperform the baseline system significantly.

input: Matrix factorization (MF) and Autoencoder (AE) are among the most successful approaches of unsupervised learning. While MF based models have been extensively exploited in the graph modeling and link prediction literature, the AE family has not gained much attention. In this paper we investigate both MF and AE’s application to the link prediction problem in sparse graphs. We show the connection between AE and MF from the perspective of multiview learning, and further propose MF+AE: a model training MF and AE jointly with shared parameters. We apply dropout to training both the MF and AE parts, and show that it can significantly prevent overfitting by acting as an adaptive regularization. We conduct experiments on six real world sparse graph datasets, and show that MF+AE consistently outperforms the competing methods, especially on datasets that demonstrate strong non-cohesive structures.

Distinct from previous work, our approach employs context-dependent word-level attention for more accurate statement representations and question-guided sentence-level attention for better context modeling. Employing these mechanisms, our model accurately understands when it can output an answer or when it requires generating a supplementary question for additional input. When available, user’s feedback is encoded and directly applied to update sentence-level attention to infer the answer. Extensive experiments on QA and IQA datasets demonstrate quantitatively the effectiveness of our model with significant improvement over conventional QA models.

input: The field of Distributed Constraint Optimization has gained momentum in recent years, thanks to its ability to address various applications related to multi-agent cooperation. Nevertheless, solving Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) optimally is NP-hard. Therefore, in large-scale, complex applications, incomplete DCOP algorithms are necessary. Current incomplete DCOP algorithms suffer of one or more of the following limitations: they (a) find local minima without providing quality guarantees; (b) provide loose quality assessment; or (c) are unable to benefit from the structure of the problem, such as domain-dependent knowledge and hard constraints. Therefore, capitalizing on strategies from the centralized constraint solving community, we propose a Distributed Large Neighborhood Search (D-LNS) framework to solve DCOPs. The proposed framework (with its novel repair phase) provides guarantees on solution quality, refining upper and lower bounds during the iterative process, and can exploit domain-dependent structures. Our experimental results show that D-LNS outperforms other incomplete DCOP algorithms on both structured and unstructured problem instances.

input: Shannon’s information entropy measures of the uncertainty of an event’s outcome. If learning about a system reflects a decrease in uncertainty, then a plausible intuition is that learning should be accompanied by a decrease in the entropy of the organism’s actions and/or perceptual states. To address whether this intuition is valid, I examined an artificial organism – a simple robot – that learned to navigate in an arena and analyzed the entropy of the outcome variables action, state, and reward. Entropy did indeed decrease in the initial stages of learning, but two factors complicated the scenario: (1) the introduction of new options discovered during the learning process and (2) the shifting patterns of perceptual and environmental states resulting from changes to the robot’s learned movement strategies. These factors lead to a subsequent increase in entropy as the agent learned. I end with a discussion of the utility of information-based characterizations of learning.

input: We study the problem of structured output learning from a regression perspective. We first provide a general formulation of the kernel dependency estimation (KDE) approach to this problem using operator-valued kernels. Our formulation overcomes the two main limitations of the original KDE approach, namely the decoupling between outputs in the image space and the inability to use a joint feature space. We then propose a covariance-based operator-valued kernel that allows us to take into account the structure of the kernel feature space. This kernel operates on the output space and only encodes the interactions between the outputs without any reference to the input space. To address this issue, we introduce a variant of our KDE method based on the conditional covariance operator that in addition to the correlation between the outputs takes into account the effects of the input variables. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our KDE approach on three structured output problems, and compare it to the state-of-the-art kernelbased structured output regression methods.

input: In the perspective of a sustainable urban planning, it is necessary to investigate cities in a holistic way and to accept surprises in the response of urban environments to a particular set of strategies. For example, the process of inner-city densification may limit air pollution, carbon emissions, and energy use through reduced transportation; on the other hand, the resulting street canyons could lead to local levels of pollution that could be higher than in a low-density urban setting. The holistic approach to sustainable urban planning implies using different models in an integrated way that is capable of simulating the urban system. As the interconnection of such models is not a trivial task, one of the key elements that may be applied is the description of the urban geometric properties in an “interoperable” way. Focusing on air quality as one of the most pronounced urban problems, the geometric aspects of a city may be described by objects such as those defined in CityGML, so that an appropriate air quality model can be applied for estimating the quality of the urban air on the basis of atmospheric flow and chemistry equations. It is generally admitted that an ontology-based approach can provide a generic and robust way to interconnect different models. However, a direct approach, that consists in establishing correspondences between concepts, is not sufficient in the present situation. One has to take into account, among other things, the computations involved in the correspondences between concepts. In this paper we first present theoretical background and motivations for the interconnection of 3D city models and other models related to sustainable development and urban planning. Then we present a practical experiment based on the interconnection of CityGML with an air quality model. Our approach is based on the creation of an ontology of air quality models and on the extension of an ontology of urban planning process (OUPP) that acts as an ontology mediator.

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset.

We give convenient optimization formulation of the Regularized Laplacian method and establish its various properties. In particular, we show that the kernel of the method can be interpreted in terms of discrete and continuous time random walks and possesses several important properties of proximity measures. Both optimization and linear algebra methods can be used for efficient computation of the classification functions. We demonstrate on numerical examples that the Regularized Laplacian method is competitive with respect to the other state of the art semi-supervised learning methods.

input: Slot Filling (SF) aims to extract the values of certain types of attributes (or slots, such as person:cities of residence) for a given entity from a large collection of source documents. In this paper we propose an effective DNN architecture for SF with the following new strategies: (1). Take a regularized dependency graph instead of a raw sentence as input to DNN, to compress the wide contexts between query and candidate filler; (2). Incorporate two attention mechanisms: local attention learned from query and candidate filler, and global attention learned from external knowledge bases, to guide the model to better select indicative contexts to determine slot type. Experiments show that this framework outperforms state-of-the-art on both relation extraction (16% absolute F-score gain) and slot filling validation for each individual system (up to 8.5% absolute Fscore gain).

input: Conventional dependency parsers rely on a statistical model and a transition system or graph algorithm to enforce tree-structured outputs during training and inference. In this work we formalize dependency parsing as the problem of selecting the head (a.k.a. parent) of each word in a sentence. Our model which we call DENSE (as shorthand for Dependency Neural Selection) employs bidirectional recurrent neural networks for the head selection task. Without enforcing any structural constraints during training, DENSE generates (at inference time) trees for the overwhelming majority of sentences (95% on an English dataset), while remaining non-tree outputs can be adjusted with a maximum spanning tree algorithm. We evaluate DENSE on four languages (English, Chinese, Czech, and German) with varying degrees of non-projectivity. Despite the simplicity of our approach, experiments show that the resulting parsers are on par with or outperform the state of the art.

input: In this paper, we investigate the cross-media retrieval between images and text, i.e., using image to search text (I2T) and using text to search images (T2I). Existing cross-media retrieval methods usually learn one couple of projections, by which the original features of images and text can be projected into a common latent space to measure the content similarity. However, using the same projections for the two different retrieval tasks (I2T and T2I) may lead to a tradeoff between their respective performances, rather than their best performances. Different from previous works, we propose a modality-dependent cross-media retrieval (MDCR) model, where two couples of projections are learned for different cross-media retrieval tasks instead of one couple of projections. Specifically, by jointly optimizing the correlation between images and text and the linear regression from one modal space (image or text) to the semantic space, two couples of mappings are learned to project images and text from their original feature spaces into two common latent subspaces (one for I2T and the other for T2I). Extensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed MDCR compared with other methods. In particular, based the 4,096 dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) visual feature and 100 dimensional LDA textual feature, the mAP of the proposed method achieves 41.5%, which is a new state-of-the-art performance on the Wikipedia dataset.

input: We propose a technique for learning representations of parser states in transitionbased dependency parsers. Our primary innovation is a new control structure for sequence-to-sequence neural networks— the stack LSTM. Like the conventional stack data structures used in transitionbased parsing, elements can be pushed to or popped from the top of the stack in constant time, but, in addition, an LSTM maintains a continuous space embedding of the stack contents. This lets us formulate an efficient parsing model that captures three facets of a parser’s state: (i) unbounded look-ahead into the buffer of incoming words, (ii) the complete history of actions taken by the parser, and (iii) the complete contents of the stack of partially built tree fragments, including their internal structures. Standard backpropagation techniques are used for training and yield state-of-the-art parsing performance.

But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset.

input: This paper proposes a framework dedicated to the construction of what we call discrete elastic inner product allowing one to embed sets of non-uniformly sampled multivariate time series or sequences of varying lengths into inner product space structures. This framework is based on a recursive definition that covers the case of multiple embedded time elastic dimensions. We prove that such inner products exist in our general framework and show how a simple instance of this inner product class operates on some prospective applications, while generalizing the Euclidean inner product. Classification experimentations on time series and symbolic sequences datasets demonstrate the benefits that we can expect by embedding time series or sequences into elastic inner spaces rather than into classical Euclidean spaces. These experiments show good accuracy when compared to the euclidean distance or even dynamic programming algorithms while maintaining a linear algorithmic complexity at exploitation stage, although a quadratic indexing phase beforehand is required.

input: Robotic commands in natural language usually contain various spatial descriptions that are semantically similar but syntactically different. Mapping such syntactic variants into semantic concepts that can be understood by robots is challenging due to the high flexibility of natural language expressions. To tackle this problem, we collect robotic commands for navigation and manipulation tasks using crowdsourcing. We further define a robot language and use a generative machine translation model to translate robotic commands from natural language to robot language. The main purpose of this paper is to simulate the interaction process between human and robots using crowdsourcing platforms, and investigate the possibility of translating natural language to robot language with paraphrases.

No modifications were directly made to these systems, but output concepts were filtered using stop concepts, stop concept text and UMLS semantic type. Concept boundaries were also adjusted using a small collection of rules to increase precision on the strict task. Overall MetaMap had better performance than YTEX on the strict task, primarily due to a 20% performance improvement in precision. In the relaxed task YTEX had better performance in both precision and recall giving it an overall F-Score 4.6% higher than MetaMap on the test data. Our results also indicated a 1.3% higher accuracy for YTEX in UMLS CUI mapping.

input: We propose zoneout, a novel method for regularizing RNNs. At each timestep, zoneout stochastically forces some hidden units to maintain their previous values. Like dropout, zoneout uses random noise to train a pseudo-ensemble, improving generalization. But by preserving instead of dropping hidden units, gradient information and state information are more readily propagated through time, as in feedforward stochastic depth networks. We perform an empirical investigation of various RNN regularizers, and find encouraging results: zoneout gives significant performance improvements across tasks, yielding state-ofthe-art results in character-level language modeling on the Penn Treebank dataset and competitive results on word-level Penn Treebank and permuted sequential MNIST classification tasks.

input: Deep learning models, which learn high-level feature representations from raw data, have become popular for machine learning and artificial intelligence tasks that involve images, audio, and other forms of complex data. A number of software “frameworks” have been developed to expedite the process of designing and training deep neural networks, such as Caffe [11], Torch [4], and Theano [1]. Currently, these frameworks can harness multiple GPUs on the same machine, but are unable to use GPUs that are distributed across multiple machines; because even average-sized deep networks can take days to train on a single GPU when faced with 100s of GBs to TBs of data, distributed GPUs present a prime opportunity for scaling up deep learning. However, the limited inter-machine bandwidth available on commodity Ethernet networks presents a bottleneck to distributed GPU training, and prevents its trivial realization. To investigate how existing software frameworks can be adapted to efficiently support distributed GPUs, we propose Poseidon, a scalable system architecture for distributed inter-machine communication in existing deep learning frameworks. In order to assess Poseidon’s effectiveness, we integrate Poseidon into the Caffe [11] framework and evaluate its performance at training convolutional neural networks for object recognition in images. Poseidon features three key contributions that improve the training speed of deep neural networks on clusters: (i) a three-level hybrid architecture that allows Poseidon to support both CPU-only clusters as well as GPU-equipped clusters, (ii) a distributed wait-free backpropagation (DWBP) algorithm to improve GPU utilization and to balance communication, and (iii) a dedicated structure-aware communication protocol (SACP) to minimize communication overheads. We empirically show that Poseidon converges to the same objective value as a single machine, and achieves state-of-the-art training speedup across multiple models and well-established datasets, using a commodity GPU cluster of 8 nodes (e.g. 4.5× speedup on AlexNet, 4× on GoogLeNet, 4× on CIFAR-10). On the much larger ImageNet 22K dataset, Poseidon with 8 nodes achieves better speedup and competitive accuracy to recent CPU-based distributed deep learning systems such as Adam [2] and Le et al. [16], which use 10s to 1000s of nodes.

We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset.

input: In this paper, we extend the deep long short-term memory (DLSTM) recurrent neural networks by introducing gated direct connections between memory cells in adjacent layers. These direct links, called highway connections, enable unimpeded information flow across different layers and thus alleviate the gradient vanishing problem when building deeper LSTMs. We further introduce the latency-controlled bidirectional LSTMs (BLSTMs) which can exploit the whole history while keeping the latency under control. Efficient algorithms are proposed to train these novel networks using both frame and sequence discriminative criteria. Experiments on the AMI distant speech recognition (DSR) task indicate that we can train deeper LSTMs and achieve better improvement from sequence training with highway LSTMs (HLSTMs). Our novel model obtains 43.9/47.7% WER on AMI (SDM) dev and eval sets, outperforming all previous works. It beats the strong DNN and DLSTM baselines with 15.7% and 5.3% relative improvement respectively.

The bound in [4] uses Rademacher complexity and has anadditive dependence on the logarithm of the number of kernels and the margin achieved by the classifier. However, there are some errors in parts of the proof which are corrected in this paper. Unfortunately, the final result turns out to be a risk bound which has a multiplicative dependence on the logarithm of the number of kernels and the margin achieved by the classifier.

input: Skip connections made the training of very deep neural networks possible and have become an indispendable component in a variety of neural architectures. A satisfactory explanation for their success remains elusive. Here, we present an explanation for the benefits of skip connections in training very deep neural networks. We argue that skip connections help break symmetries inherent in the loss landscapes of deep networks, leading to drastically simplified landscapes. In particular, skip connections between adjacent layers in a multilayer network break the permutation symmetry of nodes in a given layer, and the recently proposed DenseNet architecture, where each layer projects skip connections to every layer above it, also breaks the rescaling symmetry of connectivity matrices between different layers. This hypothesis is supported by evidence from a toy model with binary weights and from experiments with fully-connected networks suggesting (i) that skip connections do not necessarily improve training unless they help break symmetries and (ii) that alternative ways of breaking the symmetries also lead to significant performance improvements in training deep networks, hence there is nothing special about skip connections in this respect. We find, however, that skip connections confer additional benefits over and above symmetry-breaking, such as the ability to deal effectively with the vanishing gradients problem.

Now complete the following example-
input: Recent progress in randomized motion planners has led to the development of a new class of samplingbased algorithms that provide asymptotic optimality guarantees, notably the RRT∗ and the PRM∗ algorithms. Careful analysis reveals that the so-called “rewiring” step in these algorithms can be interpreted as a local policy iteration (PI) step (i.e., a local policy evaluation step followed by a local policy improvement step) so that asymptotically, as the number of samples tend to infinity, both algorithms converge to the optimal path almost surely (with probability 1). Policy iteration, along with value iteration (VI) are common methods for solving dynamic programming (DP) problems. Based on this observation, recently, the RRT algorithm has been proposed, which performs, during each iteration, Bellman updates (aka“backups”) on those vertices of the graph that have the potential of being part of the optimal path (i.e., the “promising” vertices). The RRT algorithm thus utilizes dynamic programming ideas and implements them incrementally on randomly generated graphs to obtain high quality solutions. In this work, and based on this key insight, we explore a different class of dynamic programming algorithms for solving shortest-path problems on random graphs generated by iterative sampling methods. These class of algorithms utilize policy iteration instead of value iteration, and thus are better suited for massive parallelization. Contrary to the RRT∗ algorithm, the policy improvement during the rewiring step is not performed only locally but rather on a set of vertices that are classified as “promising” during the current iteration. This tends to speed-up the whole process. The resulting algorithm, aptly named Policy Iteration-RRT (PI-RRT) is the first of a new class of DP-inspired algorithms for randomized motion planning that utilize PI methods.

This problem may be even worse for postgraduate students who are new to a field and may not know where to start. To address this problem, we have developed an online catalog of research papers where the papers have been automatically categorized by a topic model. The catalog contains 7719 papers from the proceedings of two artificial intelligence conferences from 2000 to 2015. Rather than the commonly used Latent Dirichlet Allocation, we use a recently proposed method called hierarchical latent tree analysis for topic modeling. The resulting topic model contains a hierarchy of topics so that users can browse the topics from the top level to the bottom level. The topic model contains a manageable number of general topics at the top level and allows thousands of fine-grained topics at the bottom level. It also can detect topics that have emerged recently.

input: Recently, there have been several promising methods to generate realistic imagery from deep convolutional networks. These methods sidestep the traditional computer graphics rendering pipeline and instead generate imagery at the pixel level by learning from large collections of photos (e.g. faces or bedrooms). However, these methods are of limited utility because it is difficult for a user to control what the network produces. In this paper, we propose a deep adversarial image synthesis architecture that is conditioned on coarse sketches and sparse color strokes to generate realistic cars, bedrooms, or faces. We demonstrate a sketch based image synthesis system which allows users to scribble over the sketch to indicate preferred color for objects. Our network can then generate convincing images that satisfy both the color and the sketch constraints of user. The network is feed-forward which allows users to see the effect of their edits in real time. We compare to recent work on sketch to image synthesis and show that our approach can generate more realistic, more diverse, and more controllable outputs. The architecture is also effective at user-guided colorization of grayscale images.

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

input: Lossy image compression algorithms are pervasively used to reduce the size of images transmitted over the web and recorded on data storage media. However, we pay for their high compression rate with visual artifacts degrading the user experience. Deep convolutional neural networks have become a widespread tool to address high-level computer vision tasks very successfully. Recently, they have found their way into the areas of low-level computer vision and image processing to solve regression problems mostly with relatively shallow networks. We present a novel 12-layer deep convolutional network for image compression artifact suppression with hierarchical skip connections and a multi-scale loss function. We achieve a boost of up to 1.79 dB in PSNR over ordinary JPEG and an improvement of up to 0.36 dB over the best previous ConvNet result. We show that a network trained for a specific quality factor (QF) is resilient to the QF used to compress the input image—a single network trained for QF 60 provides a PSNR gain of more than 1.5 dB over the wide QF range from 40 to 76.

input: The distinction between strong negation and default negation has been useful in answer set programming. We present an alternative account of strong negation, which lets us view strong negation in terms of the functional stable model semantics by Bartholomew and Lee. More specifically, we show that, under complete interpretations, minimizing both positive and negative literals in the traditional answer set semantics is essentially the same as ensuring the uniqueness of Boolean function values under the functional stable model semantics. The same account lets us view Lifschitz’s two-valued logic programs as a special case of the functional stable model semantics. In addition, we show how non-Boolean intensional functions can be eliminated in favor of Boolean intensional functions, and furthermore can be represented using strong negation, which provides a way to compute the functional stable model semantics using existing ASP solvers. We also note that similar results hold with the functional stable model semantics by Cabalar.

input: We tackle the problem of inferring node labels in a partially labeled graph where each node in the graph has multiple label types and each label type has a large number of possible labels. Our primary example, and the focus of this paper, is the joint inference of label types such as hometown, current city, and employers, for users connected by a social network. Standard label propagation fails to consider the properties of the label types and the interactions between them. Our proposed method, called EDGEEXPLAIN, explicitly models these, while still enabling scalable inference under a distributed message-passing architecture. On a billion-node subset of the Facebook social network, EDGEEXPLAIN significantly outperforms label propagation for several label types, with lifts of up to 120% for recall@1 and 60% for recall@3.

input: Neural machine translation has shown very promising results lately. Most NMT models follow the encoder-decoder framework. To make encoder-decoder models more flexible, attention mechanism was introduced to machine translation and also other tasks like speech recognition and image captioning. We observe that the quality of translation by attention-based encoder-decoder can be significantly damaged when the alignment is incorrect. We attribute these problems to the lack of distortion and fertility models. Aiming to resolve these problems, we propose new variations of attention-based encoderdecoder and compare them with other models on machine translation. Our proposed method achieved an improvement of 2 BLEU points over the original attentionbased encoder-decoder.

input: Common statistical practice has shown that the full power of Bayesian methods is not realized until hierarchical priors are used, as these allow for greater “robustness” and the ability to “share statistical strength.” Yet it is an ongoing challenge to provide a learning-theoretically sound formalism of such notions that: offers practical guidance concerning when and how best to utilize hierarchical models; provides insights into what makes for a good hierarchical prior; and, when the form of the prior has been chosen, can guide the choice of hyperparameter settings. We present a set of analytical tools for understanding hierarchical priors in both the online and batch learning settings. We provide regret bounds under log-loss, which show how certain hierarchical models compare, in retrospect, to the best single model in the model class. We also show how to convert a Bayesian log-loss regret bound into a Bayesian risk bound for any bounded loss, a result which may be of independent interest. Risk and regret bounds for Student’s t and hierarchical Gaussian priors allow us to formalize the concepts of “robustness” and “sharing statistical strength.” Priors for feature selection are investigated as well. Our results suggest that the learning-theoretic benefits of using hierarchical priors can often come at little cost on practical problems.

input: In state-of-the-art Neural Machine Translation, an attention mechanism is used during decoding to enhance the translation. At every step, the decoder uses this mechanism to focus on different parts of the source sentence to gather the most useful information before outputting its target word. Recently, the effectiveness of the attention mechanism has also been explored for multimodal tasks, where it becomes possible to focus both on sentence parts and image regions. Approaches to pool two modalities usually include element-wise product, sum or concatenation. In this paper, we evaluate the more advanced Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling method, which takes the outer product of two vectors to combine the attention features for the two modalities. This has been previously investigated for visual question answering. We try out this approach for multimodal image caption translation and show improvements compared to basic combination methods.

input: Let us envision a new class of IT systems, the “Support Systems for Knowledge Works” or SSKW. An SSKW can be defined as a system built for providing comprehensive support to human knowledge-workers while performing instances of complex knowledge-works of a particular type within a particular domain of professional activities. To get an idea what an SSKW-enabled work environment can be like, let us look into a hypothetical scenario that depicts the interaction between a physician and a patient-care SSKW during the activity of diagnosing a patient. The patient-care task is practiced by health-care professionals, typically within organizational setups like hospitals. An instance of the task, known as a case, is carried out by a group of professionals (physicians, surgeons, nurses, laboratory technicians etc.) led by a physician (often known as the lead physician for the case) with the primary goal of restoring an ailing patient to state of health. However, the performance also serves various secondary goals achieved through capture and reuse of information about the case. The overall task is usually divided into subtasks or activities such as examination, identification of possible diseases, clinical tests, diagnosis, treatment, follow-up etc. The actions taken during these activities and their results have complex interrelationships. The patient-care SSKW realizes an integrated IT-based system platform which supports all the constituent activities in ways consistent with their interrelationships. Our hypothetical scenario depicts a particular activity by the lead physician (shall be referred as LP hereafter), i.e., diagnosing a patient P with the help of a patient-care SSKW. Making a diagnosis results in identifying a particular disease based on available evidence (e.g., symptoms, signs and medical history of the patient, results of various clinical tests conducted) for which the patient will be treated. Such a scenario is described below. For diagnosing P , LP opens the case in SSKW and the following interactions take place:

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

input: Despite the successes in capturing continuous distributions, the application of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to discrete settings, like natural language tasks, is rather restricted. The fundamental reason is the difficulty of backpropagation through discrete random variables combined with the inherent instability of the GAN training objective. To address these problems, we propose Maximum-Likelihood Augmented Discrete Generative Adversarial Networks. Instead of directly optimizing the GAN objective, we derive a novel and low-variance objective using the discriminator’s output that follows corresponds to the log-likelihood. Compared with the original, the new objective is proved to be consistent in theory and beneficial in practice. The experimental results on various discrete datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

input: We develop a streaming (one-pass, boundedmemory) word embedding algorithm based on the canonical skip-gram with negative sampling algorithm implemented in word2vec. We compare our streaming algorithm to word2vec empirically by measuring the cosine similarity between word pairs under each algorithm and by applying each algorithm in the downstream task of hashtag prediction on a two-month interval of the Twitter sample stream. We then discuss the results of these experiments, concluding they provide partial validation of our approach as a streaming replacement for word2vec. Finally, we discuss potential failure modes and suggest directions for future work.

input: We propose a simple, scalable, fully generative model for transition-based dependency parsing with high accuracy. The model, parameterized by Hierarchical Pitman-Yor Processes, overcomes the limitations of previous generative models by allowing fast and accurate inference. We propose an efficient decoding algorithm based on particle filtering that can adapt the beam size to the uncertainty in the model while jointly predicting POS tags and parse trees. The UAS of the parser is on par with that of a greedy discriminative baseline. As a language model, it obtains better perplexity than a n-gram model by performing semi-supervised learning over a large unlabelled corpus. We show that the model is able to generate locally and syntactically coherent sentences, opening the door to further applications in language generation.

input: This paper studies the trade-off between two different kinds of pure exploration: breadth versus depth. The most biased coin problem asks how many total coin flips are required to identify a “heavy” coin from an infinite bag containing both “heavy” coins with mean θ1 ∈ (0, 1), and “light” coins with mean θ0 ∈ (0, θ1), where heavy coins are drawn from the bag with probability α ∈ (0, 1/2). The key difficulty of this problem lies in distinguishing whether the two kinds of coins have very similar means, or whether heavy coins are just extremely rare. This problem has applications in crowdsourcing, anomaly detection, and radio spectrum search. Chandrasekaran and Karp (2014) recently introduced a solution to this problem but it required perfect knowledge of θ0, θ1, α. In contrast, we derive algorithms that are adaptive to partial or absent knowledge of the problem parameters. Moreover, our techniques generalize beyond coins to more general instances of infinitely many armed bandit problems. We also prove lower bounds that show our algorithm’s upper bounds are tight up to log factors, and on the way characterize the sample complexity of differentiating between a single parametric distribution and a mixture of two such distributions. As a result, these bounds have surprising implications both for solutions to the most biased coin problem and for anomaly detection when only partial information about the parameters is known.

While essential object detection ingredients such as features, classifiers, and proposal methods have been extensively researched surprisingly little work has aimed to systematically address NMS. The de-facto standard for NMS is based on greedy clustering with a fixed distance threshold, which forces to trade-off recall versus precision. We propose a convnet designed to perform NMS of a given set of detections. We report experiments on a synthetic setup, and results on crowded pedestrian detection scenes. Our approach overcomes the intrinsic limitations of greedy NMS, obtaining better recall and precision.

input: Graphs are a useful abstraction of image content. Not only can graphs represent details about individual objects in a scene but they can capture the interactions between pairs of objects. We present a method for training a convolutional neural network such that it takes in an input image and produces a full graph. This is done end-to-end in a single stage with the use of associative embeddings. The network learns to simultaneously identify all of the elements that make up a graph and piece them together. We benchmark on the Visual Genome dataset, and report a Recall@50 of 9.7% compared to the prior state-of-the-art at 3.4%, a nearly threefold improvement on the challenging task of scene graph generation.

input: In this paper, we model the trajectory of sea vessels and provide a service that predicts in near-real time the position of any given vessel in 4’, 10’, 20’ and 40’ time intervals. We explore the necessary tradeoffs between accuracy, performance and resource utilization are explored given the large volume and update rates of input data. We start with building models based on well-established machine learning algorithms using static datasets and multi-scan training approaches and identify the best candidate to be used in implementing a single-pass predictive approach, under real-time constraints. The results are measured in terms of accuracy and performance and are compared against the baseline kinematic equations. Results show that it is possible to efficiently model the trajectory of multiple vessels using a single model, which is trained and evaluated using an adequately large, static dataset, thus achieving a significant gain in terms of resource usage while not compromising accuracy.

input: We introduce a novel validation framework to measure the true robustness of learning models for real-world applications by creating sourceinclusive and source-exclusive partitions in a dataset via clustering. We develop a robustness metric derived from source-aware lower and upper bounds of model accuracy even when data source labels are not readily available. We clearly demonstrate that even on a well-explored dataset like MNIST, challenging training scenarios can be constructed under the proposed assessment framework for two separate yet equally important applications: i) more rigorous learning model comparison and ii) dataset adequacy evaluation. In addition, our findings not only promise a more complete identification of trade-offs between model complexity, accuracy and robustness but can also help researchers optimize their efforts in data collection by identifying the less robust and more challenging class labels.

input: We tackle a task where an agent learns to navigate in a 2D maze-like environment called XWORLD. In each session, the agent perceives a sequence of raw-pixel frames, a natural language command issued by a teacher, and a set of rewards. The agent learns the teacher’s language from scratch in a grounded and compositional manner, such that after training it is able to correctly execute zero-shot commands: 1) the combination of words in the command never appeared before, and/or 2) the command contains new object concepts that are learned from another task but never learned from navigation. Our deep framework for the agent is trained end to end: it learns simultaneously the visual representations of the environment, the syntax and semantics of the language, and the action module that outputs actions. The zero-shot learning capability of our framework results from its compositionality and modularity with parameter tying. We visualize the intermediate outputs of the framework, demonstrating that the agent truly understands how to solve the problem. We believe that our results provide some preliminary insights on how to train an agent with similar abilities in a 3D environment.

input: The payload of communications satellites must go through a series of tests to assert their ability to survive in space. Each test involves some equipment of the payload to be active, which has an impact on the temperature of the payload. Sequencing these tests in a way that ensures the thermal stability of the payload and minimizes the overall duration of the test campaign is a very important objective for satellite manufacturers. The problem can be decomposed in two sub-problems corresponding to two objectives: First, the number of distinct configurations necessary to run the tests must be minimized. This can be modeled as packing the tests into configurations, and we introduce a set of implied constraints to improve the lower bound of the model. Second, tests must be sequenced so that the number of times an equipment unit has to be switched on or off is minimized. We model this aspect using the constraint Switch, where a buffer with limited capacity represents the currently active equipment units, and we introduce an improvement of the propagation algorithm for this constraint. We then introduce a search strategy in which we sequentially solve the sub-problems (packing and sequencing). Experiments conducted on real and random instances show the respective interest of our contributions.

Such models require application analysis, adaptation and expansion. Building and maintaining such models adds a substantial amount of time and labour to the application development cycle. We present a system that observes the interface of an unmodified application and records users' inter­ actions with the application. From a history of such observations we build a coarse state space of observed interface states and actions between them. To refine the space, we hypothesize sub­ states based upon the histories that led users to a given state. We evaluate the information gain of possible state splits, varying the length of the histories considered in such splits. In this way, we automatically produce a stochastic dynamic model of the application and of how it is used. To evaluate our approach, we present models de­ rived from real-world application usage data.

input: Collaborative filtering or recommender sys­ tems use a database about user preferences to predict additional topics or products a new user might like. In this paper we describe several algorithms designed for this task, in­ cluding techniques based on correlation coef­ ficients, vector-based similarity calculations, and statistical Bayesian methods. We com­ pare the predictive accuracy of the various methods in a set of representative problem domains. We use two basic classes of evalua­ tion metrics. The first characterizes accuracy over a set of individual predictions in terms of average absolute deviation. The second esti­ mates the utility of a ranked list of suggested items. This metric uses an estimate of the probability that a user will see a recommen­ dation in an ordered list. Experiments were run for datasets associ­ ated with 3 application areas, 4 experimen­ tal protocols, and the 2 evaluation met­ rics for the various algorithms. Results indicate that for a wide range of con­ ditions, Bayesian networks with decision trees at each node and correlation methods outperform Bayesian-clustering and vector­ similarity methods. Between correlation and Bayesian networks, the preferred method de­ pends on the nature of the dataset, nature of the application (ranked versus one-by-one presentation), and the availability of votes with which to make predictions. Other con­ siderations include the size of database, speed of predictions, and learning time.

The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted. The methods have

input: A common phenomena in modern recommendation systems is the use of feedback from one user to infer the ‘value’ of an item to other users. This results in an exploration vs. exploitation trade-off, in which items of possibly low value have to be presented to users in order to ascertain their value. Existing approaches to solving this problem focus on the case where the number of items are small, or admit some underlying structure – it is unclear, however, if good recommendation is possible when dealing with content-rich settings with unstructured content. We consider this problem under a simple natural model, wherein the number of items and the number of item-views are of the same order, and an ‘access-graph’ constrains which user is allowed to see which item. Our main insight is that the presence of the access-graph in fact makes good recommendation possible – however this requires the exploration policy to be designed to take advantage of the access-graph. Our results demonstrate the importance of ‘serendipity’ in exploration, and how higher graph-expansion translates to a higher quality of recommendations; it also suggests a reason why in some settings, simple policies like Twitter’s ‘Latest-First’ policy achieve a good performance. From a technical perspective, our model presents a way to study exploration-exploitation tradeoffs in settings where the number of ‘trials’ and ‘strategies’ are large (potentially infinite), and more importantly, of the same order. Our algorithms admit competitive-ratio guarantees which hold for the worst-case user, under both finite-population and infinite-horizon settings, and are parametrized in terms of properties of the underlying graph. Conversely, we also demonstrate that improperly-designed policies can be highly sub-optimal, and that in many settings, our results are order-wise optimal.

input: We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity.

input: Existing algorithms for subgroup discovery with numerical targets do not optimize the error or target variable dispersion of the groups they find. This often leads to unreliable or inconsistent statements about the data, rendering practical applications, especially in scientific domains, futile. Therefore, we here extend the optimistic estimator framework for optimal subgroup discovery to a new class of objective functions: we show how tight estimators can be computed efficiently for all functions that are determined by subgroup size (non-decreasing dependence), the subgroup median value, and a dispersion measure around the median (nonincreasing dependence). In the important special case when dispersion is measured using the mean absolute deviation from the median, this novel approach yields a linear time algorithm. Empirical evaluation on a wide range of datasets shows that, when used within branch-and-bound search, this approach is highly efficient and indeed discovers subgroups with much smaller errors.

input: Vertex Separation Minimization Problem (VSMP) consists of finding a layout of a graph G = (V,E) which minimizes the maximum vertex cut or separation of a layout. It is an NPcomplete problem in general for which metaheuristic techniques can be applied to find near optimal solution. VSMP has applications in VLSI design, graph drawing and computer language compiler design. VSMP is polynomially solvable for grids, trees, permutation graphs and cographs. Construction heuristics play a very important role in the metaheuristic techniques as they are responsible for generating initial solutions which lead to fast convergence. In this paper, we have proposed three construction heuristics H 1, H 2 and H 3 and performed experiments on Grids, Small graphs, Trees and Harwell Boeing graphs, totaling 248 instances of graphs. Experiments reveal that H 1, H 2 and H 3 are able to achieve best results for 88.71%, 43.5% and 37.1% of the total instances respectively while the best construction heuristic in the literature achieves the best solution for 39.9% of the total instances. We have also compared the results with the state-of-the-art metaheuristic GVNS and observed that the proposed construction heuristics improves the results for some of the input instances. It was found that GVNS obtained best results for 82.9% instances of all input instances and the heuristic H 1 obtained best results for 82.3% of all input instances.

input: Learning tasks such as those involving genomic data often poses a serious challenge: the number of input features can be orders of magnitude larger than the number of training examples, making it difficult to avoid overfitting, even when using the known regularization techniques. We focus here on tasks in which the input is a description of the genetic variation specific to a patient, the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), yielding millions of ternary inputs. Improving the ability of deep learning to handle such datasets could have an important impact in medical research, more specifically in precision medicine, where highdimensional data regarding a particular patient is used to make predictions of interest. Even though the amount of data for such tasks is increasing, this mismatch between the number of examples and the number of inputs remains a concern. Naive implementations of classifier neural networks involve a huge number of free parameters in their first layer (number of input features times number of hidden units): each input feature is associated with as many parameters as there are hidden units. We propose a novel neural network parametrization which considerably reduces the number of free parameters. It is based on the idea that we can first learn or provide a distributed representation for each input feature (e.g. for each position in the genome where variations are observed in data), and then learn (with another neural network called the parameter prediction network) how to map a feature’s distributed representation (based on the feature’s identity not its value) to the vector of parameters specific to that feature in the classifier neural network (the weights which link the value of the feature to each of the hidden units). This approach views the problem of producing the parameters associated with each feature as a multi-task learning problem. We show experimentally on a population stratification task of interest to medical studies that the proposed approach can significantly reduce both the number of parameters and the error rate of the classifier.

input: LetF be a set of boolean functions. We present an algorithm for learningF∨ := {∨f∈Sf | S ⊆ F} from membership queries. Our algorithm asks at most |F| ·OPT(F∨) membership queries where OPT(F∨) is the minimum worst case number of membership queries for learning F∨. When F is a set of halfspaces over a constant dimension space or a set of variable inequalities, our algorithm runs in polynomial time. The problem we address has practical importance in the field of program synthesis, where the goal is to synthesize a program that meets some requirements. Program synthesis has become popular especially in settings aiming to help end users. In such settings, the requirements are not provided upfront and the synthesizer can only learn them by posing membership queries to the end user. Our work enables such synthesizers to learn the exact requirements while bounding the number of membership queries.
