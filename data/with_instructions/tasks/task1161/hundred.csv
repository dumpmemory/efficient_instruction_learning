input: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic originating from China in 2002 was caused by a previously uncharacterized coronavirus that could be identified by specific RT-PCR amplification. Efforts to control future SARS outbreaks depend on the accurate and early identification of SARS-CoV infected patients. A real-time fluorogenic RT-PCR assay based on the 3 -noncoding region (3 -NCR) of SARS-CoV genome was developed as a quantitative SARS diagnostic tool. The ideal amplification efficiency of a sensitive SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay should yield an E value (PCR product concentration increase per amplification cycle) equal to 2.0. It was demonstrated that the 3 -NCR SARS-CoV based RT-PCR reactions could be formulated to reach excellent E values of 1.81, or 91% amplification efficacy. The SARS-CoV cDNA preparations derived from viral RNA extract and the cloned recombinant plasmid both exhibit the identical amplification characteristics, i.e. amplification efficacy using the same PCR formulation developed in this study. The viral genomic copy (or genomic equivalences, GE) per infectious unit (GE/pfu) of SARS-CoV used in this study was also established to be approximate 1200-1600:1. The assay's detection sensitivity could reach 0.005 pfu or 6-8 GE per assay. It was preliminarily demonstrated that the assay could efficiently detect SARS-CoV from clinical specimens of SARS probable and suspected patients identified in Taiwan. The 3 -NCR based SARS-CoV assay demonstrated 100% diagnostic specificity testing samples of patients with acute respiratory disease from a non-SARS epidemic region.

input: Cruzain is a member of the papain/cathepsin-L family of cysteine proteases, and the major cysteine protease of the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease. We report an auto-induction methodology that provides soluble-cruzain at high yields (> 30 mg per liter in minimal media). These increased yields provide sufficient quantities of active enzyme for use in NMR-based ligand mapping. Using CD and NMR spectroscopy, we also examined the solution-state structural dynamics of the enzyme in complex with a covalently bound vinyl sulfone inhibitor (K777). We report the backbone amide and side chain carbon chemical shift assignments of cruzain in complex with K777. These resonance assignments were used to identify and map residues located in the substrate binding pocket, including the catalytic Cys25 and His162. Selective 15 N-Cys, 15 N-His, and 13 C-Met labeling was performed to quickly assess cruzain-ligand interactions for a set of eight low molecular weight compounds exhibiting micromolar binding or inhibition. Chemical shift perturbation mapping verifies that six of the eight compounds bind to cruzain at the active site. Three different binding modes were delineated for the compounds, namely covalent, non-covalent, and non-interacting. These results provide examples of how NMR spectroscopy can be used to screen compounds for fast evaluation of enzyme-inhibitor interactions in order to facilitate lead compound identification and subsequent structural studies.

input: G-quadruplexes are non-canonical nucleic acid structures that control transcription, replication, and recombination in organisms. G-quadruplexes are present in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses. In the latter, mounting evidence indicates their key biological activity. Since data on viruses are scattered, we here present a comprehensive analysis of putative G-quadruplexes in the genome of all known viruses that can infect humans. We show that the presence, distribution, and location of G-quadruplexes are features characteristic of each virus class and family. Our statistical analysis proves that their presence within the viral genome is orderly arranged, as indicated by the possibility to correctly assign up to two-thirds of viruses to their exact class based on the G-quadruplex classification. For each virus we provide: i) the list of all G-quadruplexes formed by GG-, GGG-and GGGG-islands present in the genome (positive and negative strands), ii) their position in the viral genome along with the known function of that region, iii) the degree of conservation among strains of each G-quadruplex in its genome context, iv) the statistical significance of G-quadruplex formation.

input: Mutation rates can evolve through genetic drift, indirect selection due to genetic hitchhiking, or direct selection on the physicochemical cost of high fidelity. However, for many systems, it has been difficult to disentangle the relative impact of these forces empirically. In RNA viruses, an observed correlation between mutation rate and virulence has led many to argue that their extremely high mutation rates are advantageous because they may allow for increased adaptability. This argument has profound implications because it suggests that pathogenesis in many viral infections depends on rare or de novo mutations. Here, we present data for an alternative model whereby RNA viruses evolve high mutation rates as a byproduct of selection for increased replicative speed. We find that a poliovirus antimutator, 3D G64S , has a significant replication defect and that wild-type (WT) and 3D G64S populations have similar adaptability in 2 distinct cellular environments. Experimental evolution of 3D G64S under selection for replicative speed led to reversion and compensation of the fidelity phenotype. Mice infected with 3D G64S exhibited delayed morbidity at doses well above the lethal level, consistent with attenuation by slower growth as opposed to reduced mutational supply. Furthermore, compensation of the 3D G64S growth defect restored virulence, while compensation of the fidelity phenotype did not. Our data are consistent with the kinetic proofreading model for biosynthetic reactions and suggest that speed is more important than accuracy. In contrast with what has been suggested for many RNA viruses, we find that within-host spread is associated with viral replicative speed and not standing genetic diversity. Why organisms have different mutation rates is a longstanding question in evolutionary biology. The polymerases of RNA viruses generally lack proofreading activity and exhibit extremely high mutation rates. Because most mutations are deleterious and mutation PLOS Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.Citation: Fitzsimmons WJ, Woods RJ, McCrone JT, Woodman A, Arnold JJ, Yennawar M, et al.

We used experimental evolution and a murine infection model to show that RNA virus mutation rates may actually be too high and are not necessarily adaptive. Rather, our data indicate that viral mutation rates have evolved to be higher as a result of selection for viruses with faster replication kinetics. We suggest that viruses have high mutation rates, not because they facilitate adaptation but because it is hard to be both fast and accurate and these viruses have prioritized speed over fidelity.

input: Throughout evolutionary history, humans have been exposed to a wide variety of diseases, some of which have serious and even lethal consequences. Memorizing medicinal plants for the treatment of serious diseases likely maximized the chances of survival and reproduction and was instrumental in the evolutionary success of our species. In the present study, we used the idea of adaptive memory to understand whether human memory evolved to recall information about medicinal plants for the treatment of serious diseases. We considered plant-disease pairs of words as units of information available in a medical system based on the use of medicinal plants. The pairs included in the categories of chronic infectious diseases and transmissible infectious diseases were considered to be of higher adaptive value, whereas those included in the category of common conditions were considered to be of lower adaptive value. Pairs grouped into the category of emerging and reemerging diseases were employed to investigate conformity bias; pairs belonging to the category esthetic uses were considered to be of little adaptive relevance and utilized as an experimental control. Our results revealed that plant-disease pairs associated with the category of common conditions, considered by us to be of lower severity and less adaptive relevance for humans, were better remembered and retained in the participants' memory. We believe that prior experience with common conditions and the frequency of these conditions in the population may have intensified the ability to remember the plant-disease pairs associated with this group of diseases.

input: Transcription of hepatitis B virus (HBV) from the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) template is essential for its replication. Suppressing the level and transcriptional activity of cccDNA might have anti-HBV effect. Although cellular transcription factors, such as CREB, which mediate HBV transcription, have been well described, transcriptional coactivators that facilitate this process are incompletely understood. In this study we showed that CREBregulated transcriptional coactivator 1 (CRTC1) is required for HBV transcription and replication. The steady-state levels of CRTC1 protein were elevated in HBV-positive hepatoma cells and liver tissues. Ectopic expression of CRTC1 or its homolog CRTC2 or CRTC3 in hepatoma cells stimulated the activity of the preS2/S promoter of HBV, whereas overexpression of a dominant inactive form of CRTC1 inhibited HBV transcription. CRTC1 interacts with CREB and they are mutually required for the recruitment to the preS2/S promoter on cccDNA and for the activation of HBV transcription. Accumulation of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and cccDNA was observed when CRTC1 or its homologs were overexpressed, whereas the levels of pgRNA, cccDNA and secreted HBsAg were diminished when CRTC1 was compromised. In addition, HBV transactivator protein HBx stabilized CRTC1 and promoted its activity on HBV transcription. Our work reveals an essential role of CRTC1 coactivator in facilitating and supporting HBV transcription and replication.

input: Invasive wildlife species have the potential to act as additional host and vector species for infectious diseases. The raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonides), a carnivore species that has its origin in Asia, was taken as an example to demonstrate biological and ecological prerequisites which enables an invasive species to occupy a new habitat permanently. Studies conducted during the last 20 years identified a total of 35 species of endoparasites, five ectoparasites, six bacterial or protozoan species, and five viruses found in the subspecies Nyctereutes procyonoides ussuriensis in its original and newly occupied habitat or in Nyctereutes procyonoides koreensis in its original habitat, respectively. With reference to raccoon dogs impact as vector species and the relevance for human and animal health, we selected Trichinella spp., Echinococcus multilocularis, Francisella tularensis, rabies virus, and canine distemper virus for detailed description. Results of studies from Finland and Germany furthermore showed that biological characteristics of the raccoon dog make this carnivore an ideal host and vector for a variety of pathogens. This may result in a growing importance of this invasive species concerning the epidemiology of some transmissible diseases in Europe, including the hazard that the existence of autochthonous wildlife, particularly small populations, is endangered. Potential adverse effects on human and animal health in the livestock sector must also be taken into account. Especially with regard to its potential as a reservoir for zoonotic diseases, the raccoon dog should receive more attention in disease prevention and eradication strategies.

Targeted recombination was used to introduce amino acid substitutions into the cleavage signal of the fusion glycoprotein (spike or S protein) of MHV strain A59. The recombinants were then used to address the question of the importance of S protein cleavage and viralmediated cell-to-cell fusion on pathogenicity. Our data indicate that cleavage of spike is not solely determined by the amino acid sequence at the cleavage site, but may also depend on sequences removed from the cleavage site. In addition, ef cient cell-to-cell fusion is not necessary for virulence. Journal of NeuroVirology (2002) 8, 400-410.

input: Despite widespread use of communicable disease surveillance data to inform public health intervention and control measures, the reporting completeness of the notifiable disease surveillance system remains incompletely assessed. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive study of reporting completeness with an analysis of 53 diseases reported by 8 health care systems across North Carolina, USA, during 1995USA, during -1997USA, during and 2000USA, during -2006. All patients who were assigned an International Classifi cation of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modifi cation, diagnosis code for a state-required reportable communicable disease were matched to surveillance records. We used logistic regression techniques to estimate reporting completeness by disease, year, and health care system. The completeness of reporting varied among the health care systems from 2% to 30% and improved over time. Disease-specifi c reporting completeness proportions ranged from 0% to 82%, but were generally low even for diseases with great public health importance and opportunity for interventions.

input: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic originating from China in 2002 was caused by a previously uncharacterized coronavirus that could be identified by specific RT-PCR amplification. Efforts to control future SARS outbreaks depend on the accurate and early identification of SARS-CoV infected patients. A real-time fluorogenic RT-PCR assay based on the 3 -noncoding region (3 -NCR) of SARS-CoV genome was developed as a quantitative SARS diagnostic tool. The ideal amplification efficiency of a sensitive SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay should yield an E value (PCR product concentration increase per amplification cycle) equal to 2.0. It was demonstrated that the 3 -NCR SARS-CoV based RT-PCR reactions could be formulated to reach excellent E values of 1.81, or 91% amplification efficacy. The SARS-CoV cDNA preparations derived from viral RNA extract and the cloned recombinant plasmid both exhibit the identical amplification characteristics, i.e. amplification efficacy using the same PCR formulation developed in this study. The viral genomic copy (or genomic equivalences, GE) per infectious unit (GE/pfu) of SARS-CoV used in this study was also established to be approximate 1200-1600:1. The assay's detection sensitivity could reach 0.005 pfu or 6-8 GE per assay. It was preliminarily demonstrated that the assay could efficiently detect SARS-CoV from clinical specimens of SARS probable and suspected patients identified in Taiwan. The 3 -NCR based SARS-CoV assay demonstrated 100% diagnostic specificity testing samples of patients with acute respiratory disease from a non-SARS epidemic region.

input: The viral ribonucleoprotein complex of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) associates with the viral Envelope (Env) to form infectious virions. While Env and Gag are known to migrate to lipid microdomains, their stoichiometry and specificity of interaction is not known. Here, we analyze the association of different viral glycoproteins, HIV Env and Ebola GP, with HIV-1 Gag protein co-expressed in the same cell. Though these two viral spikes were both expressed, each associated independently with Gag and gave rise to two distinct virion populations, each with a spike of a single type. Confocal imaging demonstrated that HIV Env 89.6 and Ebola GP localized to distinct lipid raft microdomains within the same cell, where each associated with distinct Gag particles. Similar Env localization was observed in HIV-infected T cells, where ~14 percent of Env was associated with Gag during productive infection. Together, these data suggest that a single Gag complex associates ""quantally"" with an individual lipid raft microdomain to assemble functional virions during infection.

Now complete the following example-
input: In this paper, we present a new microfluidic immunoassay platform, which is based on the synergistic combination of the yeast surface display (YSD) technique and the microfluidic technology. Utilizing the YSD technique, antigens specific to the target antibody are displayed on the surface of engineered yeast cells with intracellular fluorescent proteins. The displayed antigens are then used for the detection of the target antibody, with the yeast cells as fluorescent labels. Multiplex immunoassay can be readily realized by using yeast cells expressing different intracellular fluorescent proteins to display different antigens. The implementation of this YSD-based immunoassay on the microfluidic platform eliminates the need for the bulky, complex and expensive flow cytometer. To improve the detection sensitivity and to eliminate the need for pumping, a functionalized micro pillar array (MPA) is incorporated in the microfluidic chip, resulting in a detection limit of 5 ng/mL (or 1 ng in terms of amount) and enhanced compatibility with practical applications such as clinical biopsy. This new platform has a high potential to be integrated into microfluidic detection systems to enable portable diagnostics in the future.

A comparative assessment of four serological methods used in the detection and measurement of anti-parasite antibodies in the serum of the amphibian, Bufo viridis. International Journal for Parasitology 18: 371-377. Antibodies against Cn'thidia fasciculata choanomastigotes were detected in green toad (Bufo viridis) sera by direct agglutination, indirect haemagglutination (IHA), complement-fixation test (CFT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Correlation coefficients (r) were calculated for comparisons between each of the techniques and regression formulae derived in order to convert antibody levels as determined by one immunological method to that of another. The highest mean titre obtained by ELISA was approximately 1.5-3.5 times greater than those obtained by the other techniques whilst CFT gave the lowest values. IHA and ELISA titres were affected by different preparations of the crithidial antigen extracts. Highly significant r values were determined for control sera when IHA was compared to ELISA (r> 0.79), and to both CFT and ELISA with immune animals (r> 0.96). ELISA would seem most applicable for screening other lower vertebrates for anti-parasite antibodies especially in areas of human disease prevalence.

In the present study, the influence of the administration of rFeIFN on blood markers of inflammation (a-globulins, a 1acid glycoprotein) and immune system activation (g-globulins, IgG, IgM, specific anti-feline parvovirus IgG or IgM) was evaluated in a cattery developing an outbreak of feline panleukopenia due to feline parvovirus (FPV) infection few days after initial administration of rFeIFN. Kittens (n = 23) were injected with rFeIFN (1 MU/kg subcutaneoulsy, once a day for 3 days) and their blood parameters were compared with those of 17 untreated cats. Cats that survived the outbreak were vaccinated and re-sampled 1 month after the last rFeIFN administration. Time of emergence of clinical signs and survival rate were not significantly different between the two groups. Controls and treated cats surviving the infection had high levels of g-globulins, total-and anti-FPV specific IgGs, likely due to passive transfer of maternal immunity. Compared to controls, treated kittens had lower levels of a 1 -globulins and higher mean values of g-globulins and immunoglobulins. Data from samples collected after vaccination revealed a higher level of gglobulins, total-and anti-FPV specific IgGs in treated kittens, compared with controls, suggesting that rFeIFN stimulates antibody production. Based on this results, rFeIFN should be administered to the queen, to increase passive maternal immunity, or to kittens before introduction in a potentially contaminated environment. # * P < 0.05 vs. CI. y P < 0.05 vs. CII and vs. TI.

We analyze these data, in conjunction with a comprehensive collection of flavivirus genomes, to characterize flavivirus evolutionary and biogeographic history in unprecedented detail and breadth. Based on the presumed introduction of yellow fever virus into the Americas via the transatlantic slave trade, we extrapolated a timescale for a relevant subset of flaviviruses whose evolutionary history, shows that different Culex-spp. associated flaviviruses have been introduced from the Old World to the New World on at least five separate occasions, with 2 different sets of factors likely to have contributed to the dispersal of the different viruses. We also discuss the significance of programmed ribosomal frameshifting in a central region of the polyprotein open reading frame in some mosquito-associated flaviviruses.

While the preexisting antibodies in HIV-infected patients significantly suppressed T20's antiviral activity, these antibodies neither recognized AP3, nor attenuated its anti-HIV-1 activity. Structurally different from T20, AP3 could fold into single-helix and interact with gp41 NHR. The two residues, Met and Thr, at the N-terminus of AP3 form a hook-like structure to stabilize interaction between AP3 and NHR helices. Therefore, AP3 has potential for further development as a new HIV fusion inhibitor with improved antiviral efficacy, resistance profile and pharmacological properties over enfuvirtide. The envelope glycoprotein (Env) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) includes the gp120 surface subunit and the gp41 transmembrane subunit. As a class I transmembrane protein, gp41 plays a significant role in the membrane fusion and virus entry of HIV-1 1,2 . After the binding of the gp120 to the cellular receptors, gp41 undergoes conformation changes after fusion peptide (FP) inserts into the

input: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic originating from China in 2002 was caused by a previously uncharacterized coronavirus that could be identified by specific RT-PCR amplification. Efforts to control future SARS outbreaks depend on the accurate and early identification of SARS-CoV infected patients. A real-time fluorogenic RT-PCR assay based on the 3 -noncoding region (3 -NCR) of SARS-CoV genome was developed as a quantitative SARS diagnostic tool. The ideal amplification efficiency of a sensitive SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay should yield an E value (PCR product concentration increase per amplification cycle) equal to 2.0. It was demonstrated that the 3 -NCR SARS-CoV based RT-PCR reactions could be formulated to reach excellent E values of 1.81, or 91% amplification efficacy. The SARS-CoV cDNA preparations derived from viral RNA extract and the cloned recombinant plasmid both exhibit the identical amplification characteristics, i.e. amplification efficacy using the same PCR formulation developed in this study. The viral genomic copy (or genomic equivalences, GE) per infectious unit (GE/pfu) of SARS-CoV used in this study was also established to be approximate 1200-1600:1. The assay's detection sensitivity could reach 0.005 pfu or 6-8 GE per assay. It was preliminarily demonstrated that the assay could efficiently detect SARS-CoV from clinical specimens of SARS probable and suspected patients identified in Taiwan. The 3 -NCR based SARS-CoV assay demonstrated 100% diagnostic specificity testing samples of patients with acute respiratory disease from a non-SARS epidemic region.

input: The use of small animal models for the study of infectious disease is critical for understanding disease progression and for developing prophylactic and therapeutic treatment options. For many diseases, Syrian golden hamsters have emerged as an ideal animal model due to their low cost, small size, ease of handling, and ability to accurately reflect disease progression in humans. Despite the increasing use and popularity of hamsters, there remains a lack of available reagents for studying hamster immune responses. Without suitable reagents for assessing immune responses, researchers are left to examine clinical signs and disease pathology. This becomes an issue for the development of vaccine and treatment options where characterizing the type of immune response generated is critical for understanding protection from disease. Despite the relative lack of reagents for use in hamsters, significant advances have been made recently with several hamster specific immunologic methods being developed. Here we discuss the progress of this development, with focus on classical methods used as well as more recent molecular methods. We outline what methods are currently available for use in hamsters and what is readily used as well as what limitations still exist and future perspectives of reagent and assay development for hamsters. This will provide valuable information to researchers who are deciding whether to use hamsters as an animal model.

Nonetheless, data interpretation and real understanding of viral dynamics is still hampered by the sheer complexity of the various intertwined spatio-temporal processes. In this paper we present a tool to address these issues: a cellular automata model describing critical aspects of in vitro viral infections taking into account spatial characteristics of virus spreading within a culture well. The aim of the model is to understand the key mechanisms of SARS-CoV infection dynamics during the first 24 hours post infection. We interrogate the model using a Latin Hypercube sensitivity analysis to identify which mechanisms are critical to the observed infection of host cells and the release of measured virus particles.

input: A national control program against bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine coronavirus (BCV) was launched in Norway in 2016. A key strategy in the program is to test for presence of antibodies and protect testnegative herds from infection. Because these viruses are endemic, the rate of re-introduction can be high, and a disease-free status will become more uncertain as time from testing elapses. The aim of this study was to estimate the probability of freedom (PostPFree) from BRSV and BCV antibodies over time by use of bulk tank milk (BTM) antibody-testing, geographic information and animal movement data, and to validate the herd-level estimates against subsequent BTM testing. BTM samples were collected from 1148 study herds in West Norway in 2013 and 2016, and these were analyzed for BRSV and BCV antibodies. PostPFree was calculated for herds that were negative in 2013/2014, and updated periodically with new probabilities every three months. Input variables were test sensitivity, the probability of introduction through animal purchase and local transmission. Probability of introduction through animal purchase was calculated by using real animal movement data and herd prevalence in the region of the source herd. The PostPFree from the final three months in 2015 was compared to BTM test results from March 2016 using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test. The probability of freedom was generally high for test-negative herds immediately after testing, reflecting the high sensitivity of the tests. It did however, decrease with time since testing, and was greatly affected by purchase of livestock. When comparing the median PostPFree for the final three months to the test results in 2016, it was significantly lower (p < 0.01) for test positive herds. Furthermore, there was a large difference in the proportion of test positive herds between the first and fourth quartile of PostPFree. The results show that PostPFree provides a better estimate of herd-level BTM status for both BRSV and BCV than what can be achieved by relying solely on the previous test-result.

input: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of an acute respiratory disease causing atypical pneumonia and diarrhea with high mortality. Different types of SARS-CoV vaccines, including nonreplicative and vectored vaccines, have been developed. Administration of these vaccines to animal model systems has shown promise for the generation of efficacious and safe vaccines. Nevertheless, the identification of side effects, preferentially in the elderly animal models, indicates the need to develop novel vaccines that should be tested in improved animal model systems. Live attenuated viruses have generally proven to be the most effective vaccines against viral infections. A limited number of SARS-CoV attenuating modifications have been described, including mutations, and partial or complete gene deletions affecting the replicase, like the nonstructural proteins (nsp1 or nsp2), or the structural genes, and drastic changes in the sequences that regulate the expression of viral subgenomic mRNAs. A promising vaccine candidate developed in our laboratory was based on deletion of the envelope E gene alone, or in combination with the removal of six additional genes nonessential for virus replication. Viruses lacking E protein were attenuated, grew in the lung, and provided homologous and heterologous protection. Improvements of this vaccine candidate have been directed toward increasing virus titers using the power of viruses with mutator phenotypes, while maintaining the attenuated phenotype. The safety of the live SARS-CoV vaccines is being increased by the insertion of complementary modifications in genes nsp1, nsp2, and 3a, by gene scrambling to prevent the rescue of a virulent phenotype by recombination or remodeling of vaccine genomes based on codon deoptimization using synthetic biology.

We conducted an investigation of healthcare workers exposed to laboratory-confirmed SARS patients in the United States to evaluate infection-control practices and possible SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) transmission. We identified 110 healthcare workers with exposure within droplet range (i.e., 3 feet) to six SARS-CoV-positive patients. Forty-five healthcare workers had exposure without any mask use, 72 had exposure without eye protection, and 40 reported direct skin-to-skin contact. Potential droplet-and aerosol-generating procedures were infrequent: 5% of healthcare workers manipulated a patient's airway, and 4% administered aerosolized medication. Despite numerous unprotected exposures, there was no serologic evidence of healthcare-related SARS-CoV transmission. Lack of transmission in the United States may be related to the relative absence of high-risk procedures or patients, factors that may place healthcare workers at higher risk for infection.

input: Ever since the discovery of SARS-CoV in the year 2003, numerous researchers around the world have been working relentlessly to understand the biology of this virus. As in other coronaviruses, nucleocapsid (N) is one of the most crucial structural components of the SARS-CoV. Hence major attention has been focused on characterization of this protein. Independent studies conducted by several laboratories have elucidated significant insight into the primary function of this protein, which is to encapsidate the viral genome. In addition, many reports also suggest that this protein interferes with different cellular pathways, thus implying it to be a key regulatory component of the virus too. In the first part of this review, we will discuss these different properties of the N-protein in a consolidated manner. Further, this protein has also been proposed to be an efficient diagnostic tool and a candidate vaccine against the SARS-CoV. Hence, towards the end of this article, we will discuss some recent progress regarding the possible clinically relevant use of the N-protein. #

While cures for these diseases largely depend on the medication strategies of physicians, determining the reasons for disease persistence as well for the onset of reinfection is also essential. Routine diagnosis of common diseases usually means treatment with a range of appropriate medicines; however, failure of these medications because of the drug resistance of microorganisms accompanied by a lack of alertness about the etiology of diseases often leads to fatal results. The present review reports on emerging diseases in Bangladesh and focuses on associated microbiological research into ongoing diseases including enteric, urinary tract, and malarial complications. The viruses associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and hepatitis are also discussed.

input: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic originating from China in 2002 was caused by a previously uncharacterized coronavirus that could be identified by specific RT-PCR amplification. Efforts to control future SARS outbreaks depend on the accurate and early identification of SARS-CoV infected patients. A real-time fluorogenic RT-PCR assay based on the 3 -noncoding region (3 -NCR) of SARS-CoV genome was developed as a quantitative SARS diagnostic tool. The ideal amplification efficiency of a sensitive SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay should yield an E value (PCR product concentration increase per amplification cycle) equal to 2.0. It was demonstrated that the 3 -NCR SARS-CoV based RT-PCR reactions could be formulated to reach excellent E values of 1.81, or 91% amplification efficacy. The SARS-CoV cDNA preparations derived from viral RNA extract and the cloned recombinant plasmid both exhibit the identical amplification characteristics, i.e. amplification efficacy using the same PCR formulation developed in this study. The viral genomic copy (or genomic equivalences, GE) per infectious unit (GE/pfu) of SARS-CoV used in this study was also established to be approximate 1200-1600:1. The assay's detection sensitivity could reach 0.005 pfu or 6-8 GE per assay. It was preliminarily demonstrated that the assay could efficiently detect SARS-CoV from clinical specimens of SARS probable and suspected patients identified in Taiwan. The 3 -NCR based SARS-CoV assay demonstrated 100% diagnostic specificity testing samples of patients with acute respiratory disease from a non-SARS epidemic region.

input: Background: The cause of severe disease in some patients infected with pandemic influenza A virus is unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings: We present the cellular immunology profile in the blood, and detailed clinical (and postmortem) findings of three patients with rapidly progressive infection, including a pregnant patient who died. The striking finding is of reduction in natural killer (NK) cells but preservation of activated effector CD8 T lymphocytes; with viraemia in the patient who had no NK cells. Comparison with control groups suggests that the reduction of NK cells is unique to these severely ill patients. Conclusion/Significance: Our report shows markedly reduced NK cells in the three patients that we sampled and raises the hypothesis that NK may have a more significant role than T lymphocytes in controlling viral burden when the host is confronted with a new influenza A virus subtype.

input: Diarrhea is one of the most common causes of antimicrobial use and mortality in young calves. To reduce antimicrobial use and resistance on dairy farms, research on alternative therapies for calf diarrhea is necessary. Our laboratory previously conducted a randomized clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of lactoferrin, an iron-binding protein found in colostrum, as a treatment for calf diarrhea. The trial showed significantly reduced calf mortality in diarrheic calves that were administered lactoferrin. Thus, the objective of this study was to corroborate the results of our prior clinical trial across multiple farms and to investigate the effect of lactoferrin on the morbidity and mortality of preweaned calves with naturally occurring cases of diarrhea. This randomized field trial was conducted on 5 commercial dairy farms in Ohio. In total, 485 calves (≤21 d of age) were enrolled at first diarrhea diagnosis (fecal score ≥2 defined as loose to watery) and randomly assigned to receive an oral dose of lactoferrin (3 g of lactoferrin powder dissolved in 30 mL of water) or 30 mL of water (control) once daily for 3 consecutive days. Health assessments were conducted on the day of diarrhea diagnosis (d 0) and 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 d following diagnosis. Producer records of disease treatment and mortality were collected 120 d following diagnosis. A Poisson regression model was used to test differences between treatments in disease frequency through 35 d post-diarrhea diagnosis and the incidence risk of treatment and mortality risk 120 d post-diarrhea diagnosis; the model controlled for calf age at enrollment, farm, and treatment. Median calf age at enrollment was 11 d and ranged from 1 to 26 d of age. At study enrollment, 51.3% (123/240) and 52.2% (128/245) of calves in the control and lactoferrin treatment groups, respectively, were diagnosed with severe diarrhea (fecal score = 3). The frequency of disease (diarrhea, dehydration, depression, signs of respiratory disease) through 35 d following diarrhea diagnosis was not significantly different for calves in the lactoferrin and control groups. Overall mortality risk for enrolled calves was 9.9%, and 10.7% (22/243) and 9.1% (26/242) of calves in the lactoferrin and control groups, respectively, died or were culled in the 120 d following diarrhea diagnosis. The relative risk of death or culling did not differ between treatment groups, however. Therefore, as performed in this study, lactoferrin as a treatment for calf diarrhea was not beneficial.

input: To assess the role of spatial proximity, defined as patients sharing bays, in the spread of norovirus during outbreaks in hospitals. Enhanced surveillance of norovirus outbreaks between November 2009 and November 2011. Data were gathered during 149 outbreaks of norovirus in hospital wards from five hospitals in two major cities in England serving a population of 2 million. We used the time between the first two cases of each outbreak to estimate the serial interval for norovirus in this setting. This distribution and dates of illness onset were used to calculate epidemic trees for each outbreak. We then used a permutation test to assess whether proximity, for all outbreaks, was more extreme than would be expected by chance under the null hypothesis that proximity was not associated with transmission risk. Sixty-five outbreaks contained complete data on both onset dates and ward position. We estimated the serial interval to be 1.86 days (95% confidence intervals 1.6-2.2 days), and with this value found strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis that proximity was unimportant (p < 0.001). Sensitivity analysis using different values of the serial interval showed that there was evidence to reject the null hypothesis provided the assumed serial interval was less than 2.5 days. Our results provide evidence that patients occupying the same bay as patients with symptomatic norovirus infection are at an increased risk of becoming infected by these patients compared with patients elsewhere in the same ward.

input: To exploit a cross passive immunotherapy for enterovirus-induced hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), the cross antiviral activity of a neutralizing antibody against enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) was investigated in vitro. White Leghorn specific-pathogen-free chickens were immunized with EV71 antigens and a specific isolated immunoglobulin (IgY) was prepared from the chicken egg yolk. IgY was further purified and characterized by SDS-PAGE, ELISA, western blotting and bidirectional immune agar diffusion testing. The antiviral activity and dose-response of the IgY were determined by assessing the cytopathic effect in rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells in vitro. It was indicated that the levels of IgY were increased at day 7, peaked at week 7 and were maintained at a higher level for 4 weeks following immunization when compared with the negative control. The results of western blotting and bidirectional immune agar diffusion testing revealed that the IgY had cross-binding properties in EV71 and CVA16 strains through targeting the envelope proteins (VP0, VP1 and VP3) of EV71 and CVA16. Neutralization assay results indicated that the infectivity of EV71 and CVA16 strains in RD cells was cross-blocked by IgY in a dose-dependent manner. To conclude, these findings indicate that IgY has cross antiviral activity against EV71 and CVA16 in vitro, and could potentially be developed as a passive immunotherapy for EV71-and CVA16-induced HFMD.

input: Since the emergence of the first cases in Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been quickly spreading out to other provinces and neighboring countries. Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71-7.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained. Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020) with a significant low peak value. With travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in Beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction.

Two of these RNA granules have been well characterized in yeast and mammalian cells, stress granules (SGs), which are translationally silent sites of RNA triage and processing bodies (PBs), which are involved in mRNA degradation. This review discusses the role of these RNA granules in the evasion of anti-viral stress responses through virus-induced remodeling of cellular ribonucleoproteins (RNPs).

input: Autophagy is a key innate immune response to intracellular parasites that promotes their delivery to degradative lysosomes following detection in the cytosol or within damaged vacuoles. Like Listeria and Shigella, which use specific mechanisms to avoid autophagic detection and capture, the bacterial pathogen Francisella tularensis proliferates within the cytosol of macrophages without demonstrable control by autophagy. To examine how Francisella evades autophagy, we screened a library of F. tularensis subsp. tularensis Schu S4 HimarFT transposon mutants in GFP-LC3-expressing murine macrophages by microscopy for clones localised within autophagic vacuoles after phagosomal escape. Eleven clones showed autophagic capture at six hours postinfection, whose HimarFT insertions clustered to four genetic loci involved in lipopolysaccharidic and capsular O-antigen biosynthesis. Consistent with the HimarFT mutants, in-frame deletion mutants of two representative loci, FTT1236 and FTT1448c (manC), lacking both LPS and capsular O-antigen, underwent phagosomal escape but were cleared from the host cytosol. Unlike wild type Francisella, the O-antigen deletion mutants were ubiquitinated, and recruited the autophagy adaptor p62/SQSTM1 and LC3 prior to cytosolic clearance. Autophagy-deficient macrophages partially supported replication of both mutants, indicating that O-antigen-lacking Francisella are controlled by autophagy. These data demonstrate the intracellular protective role of this bacterial surface polysaccharide against autophagy.

The SARS-CoV cDNA preparations derived from viral RNA extract and the cloned recombinant plasmid both exhibit the identical amplification characteristics, i.e. amplification efficacy using the same PCR formulation developed in this study. The viral genomic copy (or genomic equivalences, GE) per infectious unit (GE/pfu) of SARS-CoV used in this study was also established to be approximate 1200-1600:1. The assay's detection sensitivity could reach 0.005 pfu or 6-8 GE per assay. It was preliminarily demonstrated that the assay could efficiently detect SARS-CoV from clinical specimens of SARS probable and suspected patients identified in Taiwan.

input: To analyze the course of seasonal viral infections of respiratory tract in patients hospitalized in pediatric intensive care units (PICU) of 16 centers in Turkey. Materials and methods: It is a retrospective, observational, and multicenter study conducted in 16 tertiary PICUs in Turkey includes a total of 302 children with viral cause in the nasal swab which required PICU admission with no interventions. Results: Median age of patients was 12 months. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was more common in patients over one year of age whereas influenza, human Bocavirus in patients above a year of age was more common (p <0.05). Clinical presentations influencing mortality were neurologic symptoms, tachycardia, hypoxia, hypotension, elevated lactate, and acidosis. The critical pH value related with mortality was ≤7.10, and critical PCO 2 ≥60 mm Hg. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that patients with neurological symptoms, tachycardia, hypoxia, hypotension, acidosis, impaired liver, and renal function at the time of admission exhibit more severe mortal progressions. Presence of acidosis and multiorgan failure was found to be predictor for mortality. Knowledge of clinical presentation and age-related variations among seasonal viruses may give a clue about severe course and prognosis. By presenting the analyzed data of 302 PICU admissions, current study reveals severity of viral respiratory tract infections and release tips for handling them.

input: While the ferret is a valuable animal model for a number of human viral infections, such as influenza, Hendra and Nipah, evaluating the cellular immune response following infection has been hampered by the lack of a number of species-specific immunological reagents. Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is one such key cytokine. Ferret recombinant IL-2 incorporating a C-terminal histidine tag was expressed and purified and the three-dimensional structure solved and refined at 1.89 Å by X-ray crystallography, which represents the highest resolution and first non-human IL-2 structure. While ferret IL-2 displays the classic cytokine fold of the four-helix bundle structure, conformational flexibility was observed at the second helix and its neighbouring region in the bundle, which may result in the disruption of the spatial arrangement of residues involved in receptor binding interactions, implicating subtle differences between ferret and human IL-2 when initiating biological functions. Ferret recombinant IL-2 stimulated the proliferation of ferret lymph node cells and induced the expression of mRNA for IFN-g and Granzyme A. Crown

input: Background: While respiratory viral infections are recognized as a frequent cause of illness in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients, HCoV−OC43 infections have rarely been investigated as healthcareassociated infections in this population. Objectives: In this report, HCoV−OC43 isolates collected from HSCT patients were retrospectively characterized to identify potential clusters of infection that may stand for a hospital transmission. Study design: Whole-genome and S gene sequences were obtained from nasal swabs using next-generation sequencing and phylogenetic trees were constructed. Similar identity matrix and determination of the most common ancestor were used to compare clusters of patient's sequences. Amino acids substitutions were analysed. Results: Genotypes B, E, F and G were identified. Two clusters of patients were defined from chronological data and phylogenetic trees. Analyses of amino acids substitutions of the S protein sequences identified substitutions specific for genotype F strains circulating among European people. Conclusions: HCoV−OC43 may be implicated in healthcare-associated infections.

input: Duck viral enteritis (DVE) is an acute, contagious herpesvirus infection of ducks, geese, and swans of all ages and species. This disease has been responsible for significant economic losses in domestic and wild waterfowl as a result of mortality, and decreased egg production. Resveratrol is a naturally occurring phytoalexin in specific plants and exhibits inhibitory activity against many kinds of virus. In this paper, resveratrol was found to inhibit duck enteritis virus (DEV) replication in a dose-dependent manner, with a 50% inhibition concentration of 3.85 mg/mL. The inhibition in virus multiplication in the presence of resveratrol was not attributed to direct inactivation or inhibition of virus attachment to the host cells, but to the inhibition of viral multiplication in host cells. The assay of the time of addition limited the drug effect during the first 8 h of infection. This conclusion was supported by the ultrastructure images of the early stage of DEV infection, which showed that the replication of virus nucleic acid and the formation of the capsid in the cell nucleus were suppressed. In the indirect immunofluorescence assay, proteins expression in DEV infected duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) within 24 h post-infection (p.i.) was also effectively suppressed by resveratrol. In summary, the resveratrol has a good activity against DEV infection in vitro, which could be attributed to that fact that several essential immediate early viral proteins for virus replication were impacted by resveratrol.

input: Immune responses are a double-edged sword. Effective and appropriate immune responses capable of controlling viral infection while also largely preserving tissue integrity, are critical for host survival. Too strong immune responses might result in immune pathology, while too weak immune responses might cause viral persistence. Physiologic ageing is accompanied with a decline in the normal functioning of the immune system, which is termed as ""immunosenescence"". We show that aged mice (16-19 months old) are more resistant to influenza A virus (IAV) infection than the young mice. Strong immune responses in the young mice after IAV infection result in faster clearance of virus, but also cause severe lung injury and higher mortality rate. While in the aged mice, the delayed and milder immune responses contribute to reduced pulmonary damage, and are still capable to clear the infection even with a slower kinetics, displaying a more resistant phenotype during IAV infection. Hence, our work demonstrates that moderate immune responses as a decline with ageing in the aged mice balance the immune pathology and viral clearance, might be beneficial for the host during certain circumstances. Our results provide important insight to our basic knowledge of immunosenescence and immune defenses to invading pathogens. Further, our results indicate that age factors should be considered when investigating the vaccination and therapeutic strategies for severe IAV infection.

input: The archaeal exosome is a phosphorolytic 3 -5 exoribonuclease complex. In a reverse reaction it synthesizes A-rich RNA tails. Its RNA-binding cap comprises the eukaryotic orthologs Rrp4 and Csl4, and an archaea-specific subunit annotated as DnaG. In Sulfolobus solfataricus DnaG and Rrp4 but not Csl4 show preference for poly(rA). Archaeal DnaG contains N-and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD) of unknown function flanking a TOPRIM domain. We found that the NT and TOPRIM domains have comparable, high conservation in all archaea, while the CTD conservation correlates with the presence of exosome. We show that the NTD is a novel RNA-binding domain with poly(rA)-preference cooperating with the TOPRIM domain in binding of RNA. Consistently, a fusion protein containing full-length Csl4 and NTD of DnaG led to enhanced degradation of A-rich RNA by the exosome. We also found that DnaG strongly binds native and in vitro transcribed rRNA and enables its polynucleotidylation by the exosome. Furthermore, rRNA-derived transcripts with heteropolymeric tails were degraded faster by the exosome than their non-tailed variants. Based on our data, we propose that archaeal DnaG is an RNA-binding protein, which, in the context of the exosome, is involved in targeting of stable RNA for degradation.

input: Fasting paradigms elicit a wide-range of health benefits including suppressing inflammation. Exploring the molecular mechanisms that prevent inflammation during caloric restriction may yield promising new therapeutic targets. During fasting, activation of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA) promotes the utilization of lipids as an energy source. Herein, we show that ligand activation of PPARA directly upregulates the long non-coding RNA gene Gm15441 through binding sites within its promoter. Gm15441 expression suppresses its antisense transcript, encoding thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP). This, in turn, decreases TXNIP-stimulated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, caspase-1 (CASP1) cleavage, and proinflammatory interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) maturation. Gm15441-null mice were developed and shown to be more susceptible to NLRP3 inflammasome activation and to exhibit elevated CASP1 and IL1B cleavage in response to metabolic and inflammatory stimuli. These findings provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which PPARA attenuates hepatic inflammasome activation in response to metabolic stress through lncRNA Gm15441 induction. Txnip expression in vivo. Gm15441 LSL mice were treated with a PPARA agonist or fasted to assess how loss of Gm15441 impacts hepatic inflammasome activation in response to both pharmacological and physiologically-induced metabolic stress. TXNIP protein, caspase-1 (CASP1) levels, and interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) cleavage were elevated in Gm15441 LSL mice and were further increased by PPARA activation, indicating that this lncRNA plays a major role in attenuating inflammasome activation. Thus, hepatic PPARA directly regulates the lncRNA Gm15441, which in turn suppresses Txnip expression, which attenuates NLRP3 inflammasome activation during periods of metabolic stress. These studies revealed a novel regulatory mechanism supporting the beneficial effects of fasting, namely, reduced inflammation. Results To assess the regulation of lncRNAs by PPARA, RNA-seq was performed using total liver RNA isolated from Ppara +/+ mice, both with and without dietary exposure to the PPARA agonist WY-14643. A lncRNA discovery pipeline was implemented that identified 15,558 liver-expressed lncRNA genes. Of these, 13,343 were intergenic, 1,966 were antisense, and 249 were intragenic lncRNAs. 44% of the 15,558 liver-expressed lncRNAs are considered novel (Melia and Waxman, 2019). Differential gene expression analysis revealed that a total of 1,735 RefSeq genes and 442 liver-expressed lncRNA genes responded to treatment with WY-14643 at an expression foldchange >2 at FDR<0.05, with 968 RefSeq genes and 245 lncRNA genes upregulated, and 767

input: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic originating from China in 2002 was caused by a previously uncharacterized coronavirus that could be identified by specific RT-PCR amplification. Efforts to control future SARS outbreaks depend on the accurate and early identification of SARS-CoV infected patients. A real-time fluorogenic RT-PCR assay based on the 3 -noncoding region (3 -NCR) of SARS-CoV genome was developed as a quantitative SARS diagnostic tool. The ideal amplification efficiency of a sensitive SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay should yield an E value (PCR product concentration increase per amplification cycle) equal to 2.0. It was demonstrated that the 3 -NCR SARS-CoV based RT-PCR reactions could be formulated to reach excellent E values of 1.81, or 91% amplification efficacy. The SARS-CoV cDNA preparations derived from viral RNA extract and the cloned recombinant plasmid both exhibit the identical amplification characteristics, i.e. amplification efficacy using the same PCR formulation developed in this study. The viral genomic copy (or genomic equivalences, GE) per infectious unit (GE/pfu) of SARS-CoV used in this study was also established to be approximate 1200-1600:1. The assay's detection sensitivity could reach 0.005 pfu or 6-8 GE per assay. It was preliminarily demonstrated that the assay could efficiently detect SARS-CoV from clinical specimens of SARS probable and suspected patients identified in Taiwan. The 3 -NCR based SARS-CoV assay demonstrated 100% diagnostic specificity testing samples of patients with acute respiratory disease from a non-SARS epidemic region.

input: Hematological and coagulation profiles were studied in crossbred dogs experimentally infected with Angiostrongylus vasorum. Two groups of five dogs were experimentally inoculated with 50 and 100 third stage infective larvae (L 3 ) of A. vasorum per kilogram of body weight. A third group of five uninfected animals was used as control. One sample of 10 ml of blood was collected from each animal on the 10, 20, 30, and 45 days after inoculation (dai) and at 30-day intervals thereafter for the remainder of the 210-day experimental period. The blood sample was used for the complete hemogram and platelet count, as well as measurements of prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and factors V and VIII. Anemia was observed in infected dogs, 6 weeks after the infection. The eosinophils presented peaks in four periods after infection. Thrombocytopenia became accentuated on the 72 dai. Decreased prothrombin time activity and increased partial thromboplastin time were observed at the 6 and 9 weeks after infection and decreased of factors VIII and V activities occurred from 4 to 6 weeks after infection. It may be conclude that infection by A. vasorum in dogs may cause a discrete anemia during the acute phase which is probably regenerative. In addition, important hemostatic alterations due to the infection suggest a chronic intravascular consumption coagulopathy.

input: Plants are low-cost bioreactors for the production of various biopharmaceuticals including oral vaccines. Plant-derived oral vaccines are potentially useful in combating viral infections involving mucosal immunity. Transgenic plants have been generated to successfully produce mucosal vaccines against cholera, hepatitis B, foot-and-mouth disease, and Norwalk virus. As a first step toward the generation of oral vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), we have expressed a recombinant S1 protein of the SARS-CoV in transformed tobacco. Since plant transformation and regeneration of stable transformants require considerable time, we initially used a green fluorescent protein (GFP) to tag the antigen in transient expression. GFP was fused to the carboxy-terminus of S1 for expression of S1-GFP to show expression of recombinant S1 by agroinfiltration of tobacco leaves. The GFP tag enables a relatively quick confirmation of antigen expression in plant cells by fluorescent microscopy. Such analysis using GFP that precedes stable plant transformation will enable the rapid screening of multiple constructs to attain optimal recombinant protein expression. Furthermore, this approach determines the subcellular localization of the recombinant protein in plant cells, providing information on optimal subcellular targeting for production in plant bioreactors.

input: Background: BCoV is identified in both healthy and diarrheic calves, complicating its assessment as a primary pathogen. Objectives: To investigate the detection rates of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) in feces of healthy and diarrheic calves and to describe the usefulness of a pancoronavirus reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR (PanCoV-RT-PCR) assay to identify BCoV in samples of diarrheic calves. Animals: Two hundred and eighty-six calves <21 days. Calves with liquid or semiliquid feces, temperature >39.5°C, and inappetence were considered as cases, and those that had pasty or firm feces and normal physical examination were designated as controls. Methods: Prospective case-control study. A specific BCoV-RT-PCR assay was used to detect BCoV in fecal samples. Association between BCoV and health status was evaluated by exact and random effect logistic regression. Fecal (n = 28) and nasal (n = 8) samples from diarrheic calves were tested for the presence of BCoV by both the PanCoV-RT-PCR and a specific BCoV-RT-PCR assays. A Kappa coefficient test was used to assess the level of agreement of both assays. Results: BCoV was detected in 55% (157/286) of calves; 46% (66/143), and 64% (91/143) of healthy and diarrheic calves, respectively. Diarrheic calves had higher odds of BCoV presence than healthy calves (OR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.26 to 3.83, P = 0.004). A good agreement between PanCoV-RT-PCR and BCoV-RT-PCR to detect BCoV was identified (j = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.392 to 0.967; P < 0.001). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: BCoV was more likely to be detected in diarrheic than healthy calves. The PanCoV-RT-PCR assay can be a useful tool to detect CoV samples from diarrheic calves.

input: Known human coronaviruses are believed to have originated in animals and made use of intermediate hosts for transmission to humans. The intermediate hosts of most of the human coronaviruses are known, but not for HCoV-NL63. This study aims to assess the possible role of some major domestic livestock species as intermediate hosts of HCoV-NL63. We developed a testing algorithm for high throughput screening of livestock sera with ELISA and confirmation with recombinant immunofluorescence assay testing for antibodies against HCoV-NL63 in livestock. Optimization of the ELISA showed a capability of the assay to significantly distinguish HCoV-NL63 from HCoV-229E (U = 27.50, p < 0.001) and HCoV-OC43 (U = 55.50, p < 0.001) in coronavirus-characterized sera. Evaluation of the assay with collected human samples showed no significant difference in mean optical density values of immunofluorescence-classified HCoV-NL63-positive and HCoV-NL63-negative samples (F (1, 215) = 0.437, p = 0.509). All the top 5% (n = 8) most reactive human samples tested by ELISA were HCoV-NL63 positive by immunofluorescence testing. In comparison, only a proportion (84%, n = 42) of the top 25% were positive by immunofluorescence testing, indicating an increased probability of the highly ELISA reactive samples testing positive by the immunofluorescence assay. None of the top 5% most ELISA reactive livestock samples were positive for HCoV-NL63-related viruses by immunofluorescence confirmation. Ghanaian domestic livestock are not likely intermediate hosts of HCoV-NL63-related coronaviruses.

input: Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are a major concern to healthcare systems around the world. They are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, in addition to increased hospitalization costs. Recent outbreaks, including those caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Ebola virus, have highlighted the importance of infection control. Moreover, HAIs, especially those caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative rods, have become a top global priority. Although adequate approaches and guidelines have been in existence for many years and have often proven effective in some countries, the implementation of such approaches in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) is often restricted due to limited resources and underdeveloped infrastructure. While evidence-based infection prevention and control (IPC) principles and practices are universal, studies are needed to evaluate simplified approaches that can be better adapted to LMIC needs, in order to guide IPC in practice. A group of experts from around the world attended a workshop held at the 17th International Congress on Infectious Diseases in Hyderabad, India in March 2016, to discuss the existing IPC practices in LMICs, and how best these can be improved within the local context.

input: Given the interconnected nature of our world today, emerging pathogens and pandemic outbreaks are an ever-growing threat to the health and economic stability of the global community. This is evident by the recent 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, the SARS outbreak, as well as the ever-present threat of global bioterrorism. Fortunately, the biomedical community has been able to rapidly generate sequence data so these pathogens can be readily identified. To date, however, the utilization of this sequence data to rapidly produce relevant experimental results or actionable treatments is lagging in spite of obtained sequence data. Thus, a pathogenic threat that has emerged and/or developed into a pandemic can be rapidly identified; however, translating this identification into a targeted therapeutic or treatment that is rapidly available has not yet materialized. This commentary suggests that the growing technology of DNA synthesis should be fully implemented as a means to rapidly generate in vivo data and possibly actionable therapeutics soon after sequence data becomes available.

input: Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a highly lethal respiratory disease caused by a novel single-stranded, positive-sense RNA betacoronavirus (MERS-CoV). Dromedary camels, hosts for MERS-CoV, are implicated in direct or indirect transmission to human beings, although the exact mode of transmission is unknown. The virus was fi rst isolated from a patient who died from a severe respiratory illness in June, 2012, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. As of May 31, 2015, 1180 laboratory-confi rmed cases (483 deaths; 40% mortality) have been reported to WHO. Both community-acquired and hospital-acquired cases have been reported with little human-to-human transmission reported in the community. Although most cases of MERS have occurred in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, cases have been reported in Europe, the USA, and Asia in people who travelled from the Middle East or their contacts. Clinical features of MERS range from asymptomatic or mild disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure resulting in death, especially in individuals with underlying comorbidities. No specifi c drug treatment exists for MERS and infection prevention and control measures are crucial to prevent spread in health-care facilities. MERS-CoV continues to be an endemic, low-level public health threat. However, the virus could mutate to have increased interhuman transmissibility, increasing its pandemic potential.

input: Alanyl aminopeptidase (APN) is a surface-bound metallopeptidase that processes the N-terminals of biologically active peptides such as enkephalins, angiotensins, neurokinins, and cytokines. It exerts profound activity on vital processes such as immune response, cellular growth, and blood pressure control. Inhibition of either APN gene expression or its enzymatic activity severely affects leukocyte growth and function. We show here that oxidoreductasemediated modulations of the cell surface thiol status affect the enzymatic activity of APN. Additional evidence for the pivotal role of extracellular cysteines in the APN molecule was obtained when substitution of any of these six cysteines caused complete loss of surface expression and enzymatic activity. In contrast, the transmembrane Cys24 appears to have no similar function. Enzymatically inactive cysteine mutants were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum as shown by high-resolution imaging and Endoglycosidase H digestion. In the absence of any crystal-structure data, the demonstration that individual extracellular cysteines contribute to APN expression and function appears to be of particular importance. The data are the first to show thiol-dependent modulation of the activity of a typical surfacebound peptidase at the cell surface, probably reflecting a general regulating mechanism. This may relate to various disease processes such as inflammation or malignant transformation.

input: The RNA guanylyltransferase (GTase) is involved in the synthesis of the m7 Gppp-RNA cap structure found at the 59 end of eukaryotic mRNAs. GTases are members of the covalent nucleotidyl transferase superfamily, which also includes DNA and RNA ligases. GTases catalyze a two-step reaction in which they initially utilize GTP as a substrate to form a covalent enzyme-GMP intermediate. The GMP moiety is then transferred to the diphosphate end of the RNA transcript in the second step of the reaction to form the Gppp-RNA structure. In the current study, we used a combination of virtual database screening, homology modeling, and biochemical assays to search for novel GTase inhibitors. Using this approach, we demonstrate that mycophenolic acid (MPA) can inhibit the GTase reaction by preventing the catalytic transfer of the GMP moiety onto an acceptor RNA. As such, MPA represents a novel type of inhibitor against RNA guanylyltransferases that inhibits the second step of the catalytic reaction. Moreover, we show that the addition of MPA to S. cerevisiae cells leads to a reduction of capped mRNAs. Finally, biochemical assays also demonstrate that MPA can inhibit DNA ligases through inhibition of the second step of the reaction. The biological implications of these findings for the MPA-mediated inhibition of members of the covalent nucleotidyl superfamily are discussed.

input: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic originating from China in 2002 was caused by a previously uncharacterized coronavirus that could be identified by specific RT-PCR amplification. Efforts to control future SARS outbreaks depend on the accurate and early identification of SARS-CoV infected patients. A real-time fluorogenic RT-PCR assay based on the 3 -noncoding region (3 -NCR) of SARS-CoV genome was developed as a quantitative SARS diagnostic tool. The ideal amplification efficiency of a sensitive SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay should yield an E value (PCR product concentration increase per amplification cycle) equal to 2.0. It was demonstrated that the 3 -NCR SARS-CoV based RT-PCR reactions could be formulated to reach excellent E values of 1.81, or 91% amplification efficacy. The SARS-CoV cDNA preparations derived from viral RNA extract and the cloned recombinant plasmid both exhibit the identical amplification characteristics, i.e. amplification efficacy using the same PCR formulation developed in this study.

input: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERS Healthcare-associated outbreaks S U M M A R Y Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is capable of causing acute respiratory illness. Laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases may be asymptomatic, have mild disease, or have a life-threatening infection with a high case fatality rate. There are three patterns of transmission: sporadic community cases from presumed non-human exposure, family clusters arising from contact with an infected family index case, and healthcareacquired infections among patients and from patients to healthcare workers. Healthcareacquired MERS infection has become a well-known characteristic of the disease and a leading means of spread. The main factors contributing to healthcare-associated outbreaks include delayed recognition, inadequate infection control measures, inadequate triaging and isolation of suspected MERS or other respiratory illness patients, crowding, and patients remaining in the emergency department for many days. A review of the literature suggests that effective control of hospital outbreaks was accomplished in most instances by the application of proper infection control procedures. Prompt recognition, isolation and management of suspected cases are key factors for prevention of the spread of MERS. Repeated assessments of infection control and monitoring of corrective measures contribute to changing the course of an outbreak. Limiting the number of contacts and hospital visits are also important factors to decrease the spread of infection.

input: Human coronaviruses are one of the main causes of upper respiratory tract infections in humans. While more often responsible for mild illness, they have been associated with illnesses that require hospitalization. In this study, an assay for one of the human coronaviruses, OC43, was developed using a truncated recombinant nucleocapsid (N) protein antigen in an enzyme immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and evaluated using serum collected from HCoV-OC43-infected patients, healthy adults, and patients with other respiratory virus infections. Results showed that the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 90.9% (10/11) and 82.9% (39/47), respectively. To evaluate the clinical utility of the ELISA, serum samples collected from patients during an outbreak of HCoV-OC43 infection and previously identified as positive by HCoV-OC43 whole N ELISA were screened resulting in 100% diagnosis agreement between the testing methods. These results suggest that this assay offers a reliable method to detect HCoV-OC43 infection and may be a useful tool in coronavirus seroepidemiological studies.

input: Objective: To evaluate the scientific basis for the use of Kang 601 heji (K-601) as an anti-inflammatory and antipyretic agent using appropriate animal models. Methods: Carrageenan-induced rat paw and xylene-induced ear oedemas were models used to investigate anti-inflammatory actions of K-601. Lipopolysaccharide-induced pyrexia model was used to evaluate antipyretic activity in Wistar rats. The antiinflammatory and antipyretic mechanisms were evaluated by detecting prostaglandins E 2 , nitric oxide, interleukin-1b and tumour necrosis factor-a levels using appropriate reagents and ELISA kits. Results: The results revealed that K-601 reduced the level of inflammations in both antiinflammatory models in a dose-dependent manner. The same was true for the antipyretic model. The possible mechanisms of actions were through the inhibition of prostaglandins E 2 , interleukin-1b, tumour necrosis factor-a and nitric oxide. Conclusions: K-601 has proven anti-inflammatory and antipyretic actions. The findings provide a scientific basis for the use of K-601 as anti-inflammatory and antipyretic agent in traditional Chinese medicinal practice.

input: Viral exacerbations continue to represent the major burden in terms of morbidity, mortality and health care costs associated with asthma. Those at greatest risk for acute asthma are those with more severe airways disease and poor asthma control. It is this group with established asthma in whom acute exacerbations triggered by virus infections remain a serious cause of increased morbidity. A range of novel therapies are emerging to treat asthma and in particular target this group with poor disease control, and in most cases their efficacy is now being judged by their ability to reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations. Critical for the development of new treatment approaches is an improved understanding of virus-host interaction in the context of the asthmatic airway. This requires research into the virology of the disease in physiological models in conjunction with detailed phenotypic characterisation of asthma patients to identify targets amenable to therapeutic intervention.

input: Backgrounds: Up to February 16, 2020, 355 cases have been confirmed as having COVID-19 infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. It is of crucial importance to estimate the reproductive number (R0) of the novel virus in the early stage of outbreak and make a prediction of daily new cases on the ship. Method: We fitted the reported serial interval (mean and standard deviation) with a gamma distribution and applied ""earlyR"" package in R to estimate the R0 in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak. We applied ""projections"" package in R to simulate the plausible cumulative epidemic trajectories and future daily incidence by fitting the data of existing daily incidence, a serial interval distribution, and the estimated R0 into a model based on the assumption that daily incidence obeys approximately Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. Results: The Maximum-Likelihood (ML) value of R0 was 2.28 for COVID-19 outbreak at the early stage on the ship. The median with 95% confidence interval (CI) of R0 values was 2.28 (2.06-2.52) estimated by the bootstrap resampling method. The probable number of new cases for the next ten days would gradually increase, and the estimated cumulative cases would reach 1514 (1384-1656) at the tenth day in the future. However, if R0 value was reduced by 25% and 50%, the estimated total number of cumulative cases would be reduced to 1081 (981-1177) and 758 (697-817), respectively. Conclusion: The median with 95% CI of R0 of COVID-19 was about 2.28 (2.06-2.52) during the early stage experienced on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The future daily incidence and probable outbreak size is largely dependent on the change of R0. Unless strict infection management and control are taken, our findings indicate the potential of COVID-19 to cause greater outbreak on the ship.

input: Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is a viral enteric pathogen associated with calf diarrhea worldwide being, in Argentina, mostly detected in dairy husbandry systems. The aim of the present work was to study if maternal IgG1 antibodies (Abs) to BCoV acquired by colostrum intake modulate the development of BCoV infection in calves reared in a dairy farm in Argentina. Thirty Holstein calves were monitored during their first 60 days of age. Animals were classified into two groups depending on their initial BCoV IgG1 Ab titers. The ''failure of passive transfer'' (FPT) group had significantly lower IgG1 Abs to BCoV than the ''acceptable passive transfer'' (APT) group of calves (log10 1.98 vs. 3.38 respectively) (p < 0.0001). These differences were also observed when the total protein levels in both groups were compared (p = 0.0081). Moreover, 71% (5/7) of calves from the FPT group showed IgG1 seroconversion to BCoV compared to 29.4% (5/17) of animals from the APT group. Regarding viral circulation, BCoV was detected in 10% (3/30) of all calves and BCoV IgG1 Ab seroconversion was detected in 42% of the total animals showing that almost half of the calves were infected with BCoV. In conclusion, calves with high titers of specific BCoV IgG1 (≥1024) were mostly protected against viral infection, while animals with low titers of IgG1 (<1024) were mostly infected with BCoV. IgG1 Abs from colostrum origin are critical for prevention of BCoV infection. BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). mostró. Con respecto a la circulación viral, se detectó BCoV en el 10% (3/30) de los terneros así como también seroconversión de IgG1 en el 42% del total de los animales, lo que evidencia que aproximadamente la mitad de los terneros se infectaron con BCoV. Este estudio mostró que los terneros con altos títulos de IgG1 específica (≥ 1.024) estuvieron mayormente protegidos contra la infección con BCoV, mientras que los animales con títulos bajos de IgG1 (< 1.024) estuvieron predispuestos a la infección. Esto confirma que los anticuerpos IgG1 calostrales son críticos para la prevención de la infección por este agente viral.

input: 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) plays pivotal roles in the life cycle of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and only the dimeric protease is proposed as the functional form. Guided by the crystal structure and molecular dynamics simulations, we performed systematic mutation analyses to identify residues critical for 3CL pro dimerization and activity in this study. Seven residues on the dimer interface were selected for evaluating their contributions to dimer stability and catalytic activity by biophysical and biochemical methods. These residues are involved in dimerization through hydrogen bonding and broadly located in the N-terminal finger, the a-helix A 0 of domain I, and the oxyanion loop near the S1 substrate-binding subsite in domain II. We revealed that all seven single mutated proteases still have the dimeric species but the monomer-dimer equilibria of these mutants vary from each other, implying that these residues might contribute differently to the dimer stability. Such a conclusion could be further verified by the results that the proteolytic activities of these mutants also decrease to varying degrees. The present study would help us better understand the dimerizationactivity relationship of SARS-CoV 3CL pro and afford potential information for designing anti-viral compounds targeting the dimer interface of the protease.

input: Background: Morbidity and mortality rates of low birth weight (LBW) newborns at term are higher than rates in normal birth weight (NBW) newborns. LBW newborns are at greater risk to acquire recurrent bacterial and viral infections during their first few weeks of life possibly as an outcome of compromised innate immune functions. As adaptive immunity is in a naive state, increased risk of infection of LBW as compared to NBW newborns may reflect impairments in innate immunity. Methodology: To characterize the increased susceptibility to infections in LBW newborns we used microarray technology to identify differences in gene expression in LBW newborns (n = 8) compared to NBW newborns (n = 4) using cord blood. The results obtained from the microarray study were validated on a larger number of samples using real time RT-PCR (LBW = 22, NBW = 18) and western blotting (LBW = 12, NBW = 12). The Interferome database was used to identify interferon (IFN) signature genes and ingenuity pathway analysis identified canonical pathways and biological functions associated with the differentially expressed genes in LBW newborns. ELISAs for IFNs and bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein were performed in both LBW and NBW newborns and in adults (LBW = 18, NBW = 18, Adults = 8). Principal Findings: Upon microarray analysis, we identified 1,391 differentially expressed genes, of which, 1,065 genes were down-regulated and 326 genes were up-regulated in the LBW compared to NBW newborns. Of note, 70 IFN-signature genes were found to be significantly down-regulated in LBW compared to NBW newborns. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed pattern recognition receptors signaling including Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) -1, -5, and -8 genes and IFN signaling as the most significantly impacted pathways. Respiratory infectious diseases were the most significantly affected bio-functions in LBW newborns. Conclusion and Significance: Diminished PRRs, IFN-signature, and BPI gene expression raises the possibility that impairments in these pathways contribute to the susceptibility of LBW term infants to infection.

input: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic originating from China in 2002 was caused by a previously uncharacterized coronavirus that could be identified by specific RT-PCR amplification. Efforts to control future SARS outbreaks depend on the accurate and early identification of SARS-CoV infected patients. A real-time fluorogenic RT-PCR assay based on the 3 -noncoding region (3 -NCR) of SARS-CoV genome was developed as a quantitative SARS diagnostic tool. The ideal amplification efficiency of a sensitive SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay should yield an E value (PCR product concentration increase per amplification cycle) equal to 2.0. It was demonstrated that the 3 -NCR SARS-CoV based RT-PCR reactions could be formulated to reach excellent E values of 1.81, or 91% amplification efficacy. The SARS-CoV cDNA preparations derived from viral RNA extract and the cloned recombinant plasmid both exhibit the identical amplification characteristics, i.e. amplification efficacy using the same PCR formulation developed in this study. The viral genomic copy (or genomic equivalences, GE) per infectious unit (GE/pfu) of SARS-CoV used in this study was also established to be approximate 1200-1600:1. The assay's detection sensitivity could reach 0.005 pfu or 6-8 GE per assay. It was preliminarily demonstrated that the assay could efficiently detect SARS-CoV from clinical specimens of SARS probable and suspected patients identified in Taiwan. The 3 -NCR based SARS-CoV assay demonstrated 100% diagnostic specificity testing samples of patients with acute respiratory disease from a non-SARS epidemic region.

input: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly escalating epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Identification of a simple and effective indicator to assess disease severity and prognosis is urgently needed. Dynamic changes of blood lymphocyte percentage (LYM%) in 15 death cases, 15 severe cases as well as 40 moderate cases of COVID-19 patients were retrospectively analyzed. A Time-LYM% model (TLM) was established according to the descriptive studies and was validated in 92 hospitalized cases. Results from death and severe cases showed that LYM% in blood tests were inversely associated with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. LYM% in moderate type of patients with COVID-19 remained higher than 20% 10-12 days after symptom onset. In contrast, LYM% was lower than 20% in severe cases. However, LYM% in severe cases was higher than 5% 17-19 days after the onset of the disease, while it fell below 5% in death cases. Accordingly, we established a Time-LYM% model (TLM), which was validated as an independent criterion of disease classification in another 92 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Lymphopenia can be used as an indicator of disease severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. TLM is worth of application in the clinical practice.

input: 2H phosphoesterases catalyze reactions on nucleotide substrates and contain two conserved histidine residues in the active site. Very limited information is currently available on the details of the active site and substrate/product binding during the catalytic cycle of these enzymes. We performed a comprehensive X-ray crystallographic study of mouse 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), a membraneassociated enzyme present at high levels in the tetrapod myelin sheath. We determined crystal structures of the CNPase phosphodiesterase domain complexed with substrate, product, and phosphorothioate analogues. The data provide detailed information on the CNPase reaction mechanism, including substrate binding mode and coordination of the nucleophilic water molecule. Linked to the reaction, an open/close motion of the β5-α7 loop is observed. The role of the N terminus of helix α7-unique for CNPase in the 2H family-during the reaction indicates that 2H phosphoesterases differ in their respective reaction mechanisms despite the conserved catalytic residues. Furthermore, based on small-angle X-ray scattering, we present a model for the full-length enzyme, indicating that the two domains of CNPase form an elongated molecule. Finally, based on our structural data and a comprehensive bioinformatics study, we discuss the conservation of CNPase in various organisms.

input: Saffold virus (SAFV), a picornavirus, is occasionally detected in children with acute flaccid paralysis, meningitis, and cerebellitis; however, the neuropathogenicity of SAFV remains undetermined. The virulence of two clinical isolates of SAFV type 3 (SAFV-3) obtained from a patient with aseptic meningitis (AM strain) and acute upper respiratory inflammation (UR strain) was analyzed in neonatal and young mice utilizing virological, pathological, and immunological methods. The polyproteins of the strains differed in eight amino acids. Both clinical isolates were infective, exhibited neurotropism, and were mildly neurovirulent in neonatal ddY mice. Both strains pathologically infected neural progenitor cells and glial cells, but not large neurons, with the UR strain also infecting epithelial cells. UR infection resulted in longer inflammation in the brain and spinal cord because of demyelination, while the AM strain showed more infectivity in the cerebellum in neonatal ddY mice. Additionally, young BALB/c mice seroconverted following mucosal inoculation with the UR, but not the AM, strain. Both SAFV-3 isolates had neurotropism and mild neurovirulence but showed different cell tropisms in both neonatal and young mouse models. This animal model has the potential to recapitulate the potential neuropathogenicity of SAFV-3.

input: Purpose: The aim of the study was to identify characteristic clinical features and outcomes of critically ill patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Materials and Methods: This retrospective study enrolled all patients admitted to a 12-bed SARS intensive care unit (ICU) in a tertiary care medical center in Taipei between May 15 and July 17, 2003. Patients with positive results of either reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction or antibody to SARS coronavirus were defined as SARS cases and others with negative results as control cases. Results: Of the 50 patients, 14 had confirmed SARS. Demographics were similar between the 2 groups. The highest leukocyte and neutrophil counts, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase; positive endexpiratory pressure; and use of corticosteroids, ribavirin, and intravenous immunoglobulin were higher in the SARS group. In contrast, the lowest lymphocyte count and the ratio of PaO 2 to the fraction of inspired oxygen were lower in the SARS group. Of the 15 deaths in the control group, 12 (80%) occurred during the first 2 weeks after ICU admission. However, in the confirmed SARS group, 5 (55.6%) of the 9 deaths occurred within the third or fourth week. This difference in timing between these 2 groups was significant (P = .004). Conclusions: In a SARS ICU, patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS had significantly different clinical features and timing of mortality from those of the control group.

input: Partetravirus is a recently described group of animal parvoviruses which include the human partetravirus, bovine partetravirus and porcine partetravirus (previously known as human parvovirus 4, bovine hokovirus and porcine hokovirus respectively). In this report, we describe the discovery and genomic characterization of partetraviruses in bovine and ovine samples from China. These partetraviruses were detected by PCR in 1.8% of bovine liver samples, 66.7% of ovine liver samples and 71.4% of ovine spleen samples. One of the bovine partetraviruses detected in the present samples is phylogenetically distinct from previously reported bovine partetraviruses and likely represents a novel genotype. The ovine partetravirus is a novel partetravirus and phylogenetically most related to the bovine partetraviruses. The genome organization is conserved amongst these viruses, including the presence of a putative transmembrane protein encoded by an overlapping reading frame in ORF2. Results from the present study provide further support to the classification of partetraviruses as a separate genus in Parvovirinae.

input: Numerous reviews on dog zonoses address long-lasting lists of zoonotic infections, observed worldwide or very specifically in certain regions only. Here we describe the average family dog in the Western hemisphere owned by an average family without sufficient knowledge about potential hazards their pet might transmit to family members. This chapter is based on semi quantitative risk analysis in order to rank potential health risk transmitted from family dogs to human. Surprisingly every day risk is different from the generally expected potential risk according to traditional ranking of hazards (zoonoses) in dogs in general. Attention is given to human behavior regarding the family dog and responsible dog ownership. Modern trends include pet travel or pet import from endemic to non-endemic areas, without sufficient knowledge amongst pet owners or public health institutes. Of great value is information provided by ESCCAP (www.esccap.org) with information for European countries (veterinarians and pet-owners) on prevalences and prevention of parasitic infections in dogs and cats in the major languages of Europe. Eventually attention is paid to new trends in dog feed such as feeding bones and raw meat. This may have serious consequences for the spread of ordinary zoonoses like Salmonella and parasitic infections not only between dogs, but also to family members. A last point of attention is the prevention of attracting wild life zoonoses via dogs to family members (eg. Echinococcus multilocularis and Baylisascaris spp.). Authorities responsible for public health should be encouraged to pay more attention, not only in providing more regulations, but primary in enforcement of existing rules and stimulating responsible pet-ownership. Companion animal veterinarians and (local) public health authorities, including physicians, should contribute equally in zoonoses prevention programs ('One health' approach). 575

input: Graphical Abstract Highlights d DENV NS4B induces mitochondria elongation during viral infection d Elongated mitochondria and virus-induced convoluted membranes are physically linked d NS4B inhibits activation of the mitochondrial fission factor DRP1 d Mitochondria elongation alleviates DENV-induced RIG-Idependent innate immunity SUMMARY With no antiviral drugs or widely available vaccines, Dengue virus (DENV) constitutes a public health concern. DENV replicates at ER-derived cytoplasmic structures that include substructures called convoluted membranes (CMs); however, the purpose of these membrane alterations remains unclear. We determine that DENV nonstructural protein (NS)4B, a promising drug target with unknown function, associates with mitochondrial proteins and alters mitochondria morphology to promote infection. During infection, NS4B induces elongation of mitochondria, which physically contact CMs. This restructuring compromises the integrity of mitochondria-associated membranes, sites of ER-mitochondria interface critical for innate immune signaling. The spatio-temporal parameters of CM biogenesis and mitochondria elongation are linked to loss of activation of the fission factor Dynamin-Related Protein-1. Mitochondria elongation promotes DENV replication and alleviates RIG-I-dependent activation of interferon responses. As Zika virus infection induces similar mitochondria elongation, this perturbation may protect DENV and related viruses from innate immunity and create a favorable replicative environment.

The assay's detection sensitivity could reach 0.005 pfu or 6-8 GE per assay. It was preliminarily demonstrated that the assay could efficiently detect SARS-CoV from clinical specimens of SARS probable and suspected patients identified in Taiwan. The 3 -NCR based SARS-CoV assay demonstrated 100% diagnostic specificity testing samples of patients with acute respiratory disease from a non-SARS epidemic region.

input: Note: this report is a pre-print and has not yet been peer-reviewed. As the number of novel coronavirus cases grows both inside and outside of China, public health authorities require evidence on the effectiveness of control measures such as thermal screening of arrivals at airports. We evaluated the effectiveness of exit and entry screening for 2019-nCoV infection. In our baseline scenario, we estimated that 46.5% (95%CI: 35.9 to 57.7) of infected travellers would not be detected, depending on the incubation period, sensitivity of exit and entry screening, and the proportion of cases which are asymptomatic. Airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of 2019-nCoV infected travellers to avoid entry of infected travellers. We developed an online tool so that results can be updated as new information becomes available. As of 29 Jan 2019, 5,997 confirmed and 9,239 suspected cases of 2019-nCoV have been reported from China with 132 deaths confirmed so far 1 . There were cases in at least 15 other countries, identified due to symptoms plus recent travel history to Hubei province, China, which strongly suggests that the reported cases constitute only a small fraction of the actual number of infected individuals in China 2 . While the most affected region, Hubei province, has now ceased air travel and closed major public transport routes 3 it is unlikely that these measures will fully contain the outbreak. Despite limited evidence for its effectiveness 4,5 , airport screening is frequently implemented to limit the probability of infected cases entering other regions or countries. Here we use the available evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of exit and entry screening for detecting travellers with 2019-nCoV. We also provide an online app so that results can be updated as new information becomes available. .

input: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic originating from China in 2002 was caused by a previously uncharacterized coronavirus that could be identified by specific RT-PCR amplification. Efforts to control future SARS outbreaks depend on the accurate and early identification of SARS-CoV infected patients. A real-time fluorogenic RT-PCR assay based on the 3 -noncoding region (3 -NCR) of SARS-CoV genome was developed as a quantitative SARS diagnostic tool. The ideal amplification efficiency of a sensitive SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay should yield an E value (PCR product concentration increase per amplification cycle) equal to 2.0. It was demonstrated that the 3 -NCR SARS-CoV based RT-PCR reactions could be formulated to reach excellent E values of 1.81, or 91% amplification efficacy.

input: Since the identification and imprisonment of ""Typhoid Mary,"" a woman who infected at least 47 people with typhoid in the early 1900s, epidemiologists have recognized that 'superspreading' hosts play a key role in disease epidemics. Such variability in transmission also exists among species within a community (amplification hosts) and among habitat patches across a landscape (disease 'hotspots'), underscoring the need for an integrative framework for studying transmission heterogeneity. Here, we synthesize literature on human, plant, and animal diseases to evaluate the relative contributions of host, pathogen, and environmental factors in driving transmission heterogeneity across hosts and space. We show that host and spatial heterogeneity are closely linked and that quantitatively assessing the contribution of infectious individuals, species, or environmental patches to overall transmission can aid management strategies. We conclude by posing hypotheses regarding how pathogen natural history influences transmission heterogeneity and highlight emerging frontiers in the study of transmission heterogeneity.

We now report our experiences in the fusion of both long term cultures of rat T cell clones and mouse T cell lines to rat W/Fu (C58NT)D. Upon fusion of rat T cell clones the hybrids obtained expressed antigen specificities identical to those of the parent clones. In addition, C58 was used for interspecies hybridisation of murine T cell lines. The specificity of intra-and inter-species hybrids was maintained by subcloning. We conclude that the C58 cell line can be used to generate continuously growing monoclonal T-cell reagents of sufficient stability using both intra-and inter-species hybridisation.

input: This research explores perceived importance of safety and security measures from the perspectives of tourists and service providers. Use of face-to-face-semi structured interviews with supply side providers in Thailand results in recognizing safety measures to ask tourists about, other than those found in the literature. Researchers collected questionnaire data from international leisure and business tourists to Thailand on importance of safety and security measures. Analysis of the importance of 23 safety and security measures show a six factor pattern in thinking about measures. However, the most important measure is not in a factor. Therefore, the study considers analysis method issues and raises questions about the value of structured data and merits of the recognition of if-then conditions by research methods such as long interviews. Examination of practical, theoretical and methodological values of findings includes considering research needed and the utility of safety measure information in business decision making.

input: Molecular diagnostics of infectious diseases, in particular, nucleic-acid-based methods, are the fastest growing field in clinical laboratory diagnostics. These applications are stepwise replacing or complementing culture-based, biochemical, and immunological assays in microbiology laboratories. The first-generation nucleic acid assays were monoparametric such as conventional tests, determining only a single parameter. Improvements and new approaches in technology now open the possibility for the development of multiparameter assays using microarrays, multiplex nucleic acid amplification techniques, or mass spectrometry, while the introduction of closed-tube systems has resulted in rapid microbial diagnostics with a subsequently reduced contamination risk. Whereas the first assays were focused on the detection and identification of microbial pathogens, these new technologies paved the way for the parallel determination of multiple antibiotic resistance determinants or to perform microbial epidemiology and surveillance on a genetic level. Phenotype-based methods One of the oldest but still very important methods in clinical bacteriology is the detection of human pathogens by direct microscopic examination of the specimen. Many

input: To develop a more effective vaccination strategy for reducing the impact of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, especially in young infants (<6 months old), it is necessary to understand the transmission dynamics of RSV. Methods. We conducted a community-based prospective cohort study from 2014 to 2016 in Biliran Province, the Philippines, on children <5 years old. We collected nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) during household visits and at health facilities. In households (n = 181) with RSV-positive ARI cases (RSV-ARI), we also identified ARI episodes among other children <5 years old in the same household. In addition, we determined the serial interval to estimate the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case. Results. In the 181 households analyzed, we found 212 RSV-ARI in 152 households with a single case and 29 households with multiple cases, which included 29 1st RSV-ARI and 31 2nd RSV-ARI. We also found possible index cases among children <5 years old in the same household for 29.0% (18 of 62) of young infants with RSV-ARI. The estimated mean serial interval was 3.2 days, and R 0 was estimated to be 0.92-1.33 for RSV-A and 1.04-1.76 for RSV-B, which varied between different times (2014 and 2015) and places. Conclusions. Young infants are likely to acquire RSV infection from older children in the same household. Therefore, vaccination targeting older children might protect infants from RSV infection.

input: NICEATM and ICCVAM convened an international workshop to review the state of the science of human and veterinary vaccine potency and safety testing methods and to identify opportunities to advance new and improved methods that can further reduce, refine, and replace animal use. Six topics were addressed in detail by speakers and workshop participants and are reported in a series of six reports. This workshop report, the second in the series, provides recommendations for current and future use of nonanimal methods and strategies for veterinary vaccine potency testing. Workshop participants recommended that future efforts to replace animal use give priority to vaccines (1) that use large numbers of animals per test and for which many serials are produced annually, (2) that involve significant animal pain and distress during procedures, (3) for which the functional protective antigen has been identified, (4) that involve foreign animal/zoonotic organisms that are dangerous to humans, and (5) that involve pathogens that can be easily spread to wildlife populations. Vaccines identified as the highest priorities were those for rabies, Leptospira spp., Clostridium spp., Erysipelas, foreign animal diseases (FAD), poultry diseases, and fish diseases. Further research on the identification, purification, and characterization of vaccine protective antigens in veterinary vaccines was also identified as a priority. critical knowledge and data gaps, including opportunities to apply new science and technology. Recommendations included (1) investigations into the relative impact of various adjuvants on antigen quantification assays, (2) investigations into extraction methods that could be used for vaccines containing adjuvants that can interfere with antigen assays, and (3) review of the current status of rabies and tetanus human vaccine in vitro potency methods for their potential application to the corresponding veterinary vaccines. Workshop participants recommended enhanced international harmonization and cooperation and closer collaborations between human and veterinary researchers to expedite progress. Implementation of the workshop recommendations is expected to advance alternative in vitro methods for veterinary vaccine potency testing that will benefit animal welfare and replace animal use while ensuring continued protection of human and animal health.

Some of the current markers in clinical use do not provide optimal sensitivity and specificity, with the prostate cancer antigen (PSA) being one of many such examples. The emergence of proteomic techniques and systems approaches to study disease pathophysiology has rekindled the quest for new biomarkers. In particular the use of protein microarrays has surged as a powerful tool for large scale testing of biological samples. Approximately half the reports on protein microarrays have been published in the last two years especially in the area of biomarker discovery.

input: a b s t r a c t N-7 and 2 0 -O methylation of host cell mRNA occurs in the nucleus and results in the generation of cap structures (cap 0, m 7 GpppN; cap 1, m 7 GpppNm) that control gene expression by modulating nuclear export, splicing, turnover, and protein synthesis. Remarkably, RNA cap modification also contributes to mammalian cell host defense as viral RNA lacking 2 0 -O methylation is sensed and inhibited by IFIT1, an interferon (IFN) stimulated gene (ISG). Accordingly, pathogenic viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm have evolved mechanisms to circumvent IFIT1 restriction and facilitate infection of mammalian cells. These include: (a) generating cap 1 structures on their RNA through cap-snatching or virally-encoded 2 0 -O methyltransferases, (b) using cap-independent means of translation, or (c) using RNA secondary structural motifs to antagonize IFIT1 binding. This review will discuss new insights as to how specific modifications at the 5 0 -end of viral RNA modulate host pathogen recognition responses to promote infection and disease.

A real-time fluorogenic RT-PCR assay based on the 3 -noncoding region (3 -NCR) of SARS-CoV genome was developed as a quantitative SARS diagnostic tool. The ideal amplification efficiency of a sensitive SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay should yield an E value (PCR product concentration increase per amplification cycle) equal to 2.0. It was demonstrated that the 3 -NCR SARS-CoV based RT-PCR reactions could be formulated to reach excellent E values of 1.81, or 91% amplification efficacy. The SARS-CoV cDNA preparations derived from viral RNA extract and the cloned recombinant plasmid both exhibit the identical amplification characteristics, i.e. amplification efficacy using the same PCR formulation developed in this study. The viral genomic copy (or genomic equivalences, GE) per infectious unit (GE/pfu) of SARS-CoV used in this study was also established to be approximate 1200-1600:1. The assay's detection sensitivity could reach 0.005 pfu or 6-8 GE per assay. It was preliminarily demonstrated that the assay could efficiently detect SARS-CoV from clinical specimens of SARS probable and suspected patients identified in Taiwan. The 3 -NCR based SARS-CoV assay demonstrated 100% diagnostic specificity testing samples of patients with acute respiratory disease from a non-SARS epidemic region.

input: Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are cysteine protease proteins that reverse the ubiquitination by removing ubiquitins from the target protein. With over 100 DUBs identified and categorized into at least 7 families, many DUBs interact with one or more cytokines, influencing cellular processes, such as antiviral responses, inflammatory responses, apoptosis, etc. While some DUBs influence cytokine pathway or production, some DUBs are cytokine-inducible. In this article, we summarize a list of DUBs, their interaction with cytokines, target proteins and mechanisms of action.

input: Epizootic Epitheliotropic Disease Virus (EEDV; Salmonid Herpesvirus-3) causes a serious disease hatchery-reared lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), threatening restoration efforts of this species in North America. The current inability to replicate EEDV in vitro necessitates the search for a reproducible, sensitive, and specific assay that allows for its detection and quantitation in a time-and cost-effective manner. Herein, we describe a loopmediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay that was developed for the quantitative detection of EEDV in infected fish tissues. The newly developed LAMP reaction was optimized in the presence of calcein, and the best results were produced using 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1.8 mM dNTPs and at an incubation temperature of 67.1°C. This method was highly specific to EEDV, as it showed no cross-reactivity with several fish viruses, including Salmonid Herpesvirus -1 , -2, -4, and -5, Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus, Spring Viremia of Carp Virus, Infectious Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus, Golden Shiner Reovirus, Fathead Minnow Nidovirus, and Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus. The analytical sensitivity of the EEDV-LAMP method was estimated to be as low as 16 copies of plasmid per reaction. When infected fish tissue was used, a positive reaction could be obtained when an infected gill tissue sample that contained 430 viral copies/μg was diluted up to five orders of magnitude. The sensitivity and specificity of the newly developed LAMP assay compared to the SYBR Green qPCR assay were 84.3% and 93.3%, respectively. The quantitative LAMP for EEDV had a correlation coefficient (R 2 = 0.980), and did not differ significantly from the SYBR Green quantitative PCR assay (p > 0.05). Given its cost-and time-effectiveness, this quantitative LAMP assay is suitable for screening lake trout populations and for the initial diagnosis of clinical cases.

input: The need for novel therapeutic options to fight herpesvirus infections still persists. Herein we report the design, synthesis and antiviral evaluation of a new family of non-nucleoside antivirals, derived from 1-[x-(4-bromophenoxy)alkyl]uracil derivatives -previously reported inhibitors of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Introduction of the N-(4-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide side chain at N 3 increased their potency and widened activity spectrum. The most active compounds in the series exhibit submicromolar activity against different viral strains of HCMV and varicella zoster virus (VZV) replication in HEL cell cultures. Inactivity against other DNA and RNA viruses, including herpes simplex virus 1/2, points to a novel mechanism of antiviral action.

input: Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are known respiratory pathogens associated with a range of respiratory outcomes. In the past 14 years, the onset of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have thrust HCoVs into spotlight of the research community due to their high pathogenicity in humans. The study of HCoV-host interactions has contributed extensively to our understanding of HCoV pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss some of the recent findings of host cell factors that might be exploited by HCoVs to facilitate their own replication cycle. We also discuss various cellular processes, such as apoptosis, innate immunity, ER stress response, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway that may be modulated by HCoVs. Diseases 2016, 4, 26 2 of 28 but with a much higher mortality rate of about 35% [17] . Unlike SARS-CoV, which exhibits super-spreader events, transmission of MERS-CoV is geographically limited [12] . In fact, reported cases of MERS-CoV often stem from outbreaks within the Middle Eastern countries or recent travel to the region [18, 19] . CoVs are a group of large enveloped RNA viruses under the Coronaviridae family. Together with Artierivirdae and Roniviridae, Coronaviridae is classified under the Nidovirale order [20] . As proposed by the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses, CoVs are further categorized into four main genera, Alpha-, Beta-, Gammaand Deltacoronaviruses based on sequence comparisons of entire viral genomes [21, 22] . These CoVs can infect a wide variety of hosts, including avian, swine and humans. HCoVs are identified to be either in the Alphaor Betacoronavirus genera, including Alphacoronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, and Betacoronaviruses, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 (Table 1) . Under the electron microscope, the CoV virions appear to be roughly spherical or moderately pleomorphic, with distinct ""club-like"" projections formed by the spike (S) protein [23, 24] . Within the virion interior lies a helically symmetrical nucleocapsid that encloses a single-stranded and positive sense RNA viral genome of an extraordinarily large size of about 26 to 32 kilobases [20] . The positive sense viral genomic RNA acts as a messenger RNA (mRNA), comprising a 5 1 terminal cap structure and a 3 1 poly A tail. This genomic RNA acts in three capacities during the viral life cycle: (1) as an initial RNA of the infectious cycle; (2) as a template for replication and transcription; and (3) as a substrate for packaging into the progeny virus. The replicase-transcriptase is the only protein translated from the genome, while the viral products of all downstream open reading frames are derived from subgenomic mRNAs. In all CoVs, the replicase gene makes up approximately 5 1 two-thirds of the genome and is comprised of two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which encodes 16 non-structural proteins. The final one-third of the CoV genomic RNA encodes CoV canonical set of four structural protein genes, in the order of spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). In addition, several accessory ORFs are also interspersed along the structural protein genes and the number and location varies among CoV species [25] (Figure 1).

The positive sense viral genomic RNA acts as a messenger RNA (mRNA), comprising a 5′ terminal cap structure and a 3′ poly A tail. This genomic RNA acts in three capacities during the viral life cycle: (1) as an initial RNA of the infectious cycle; (2) as a template for replication and transcription; and (3) as a substrate for packaging into the progeny virus.

This study compares 4 different multiplex PCR assays for the recovery of common respiratory viruses. We tested 213 respiratory specimens using four different multiplex PCR assays: the xTAG respiratory viral panel fast (Abbott Molecular Laboratories), Fast-track Respiratory Pathogen assay (Fast-track Diagnostics), Easyplex respiratory pathogen 12 kit (Ausdiagnostics), and an in-house multiplex real-time PCR assay. The performance of the four assays was very similar, with 93-100% agreement for all comparisons. Other issues, such as through-put, technical requirements and cost, are likely to be as important for making a decision about which of these assays to use given their comparative performance.

input: The genome of bacteriophage q~6 is composed of three unique segments of double-stranded RNA packaged within a procapsid. One segment can recombine with another in regions that share little sequence similarity. Although the recombination is therefore heterologous, the crossover points usually consist of two to six identical nucleotides. The frequency of recombinants is enhanced by conditions that prevent or hinder the minus strand synthesis of a single plus strand segment. Recombination serves as a repair system as well as a means of changing the genetic structure of the virus. The reaction can be studied in an in-vitro packaging and replication system involving purified procapsids and ssRNA. Although there are striking differences in the mechanisms of recombination in RNA viruses, there are also strong similarities. All seem to use a copy-choice template switching action for recombination. The q~ 6 system is a useful model for the recombination of other segmented double-stranded RNA viruses such as the Reoviridae.

input: Background: The spread of an novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously named 2019-nCoV) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. Elucidating the diagnostic value of different methods, especially the auxiliary diagnosis value of antibodies assays for SARS-CoV-2 infection is helpful for improving the sensitivities of pathogenic-diagnosis, providing timely treatment, and differentiating the infected cases from the healthy, thus preventing further epidemics. Methods: Medical records from 38 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang from January 22, 2020 to February 28, 2020 were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Specimens including throat swabs, sputum and serum were collected during the hospitalization period, viral RNAs and serum IgM-IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were measured respectively. The detectability of different methods as well as the auxiliary diagnosis value of antibodies test for SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed. Results: Among 38 patients, the total seropositive rate for IgM and IgG was 50.0% and 92.1%, respectively. Two patients remained seronegative throughout the course of illness. In the early phase of illness, the RNA test for sputum specimens possessed the highest detectability(92.3%), followed by the the RNA test for throat swabs (69.2%), and the antibodies assays presented lower positive rates(IgM, 23.0%, IgG, 53.8%). While, the sensitivity of antibodies assays overtook that of RNA test since day 8 after onset (IgM, 50.0%; IgG, 87.5%). Of note, the positive rate of throat swabs was only 13.0% for cases in later phase(≥15 d.a.o), and the sensitivities of IgM and IgG rose to 52.2% and 91.3%, respectively. Combined use of antibodies assay and qRT-PCR at the same time was able to improve the sensitivities of pathogenic-diagnosis, especially for the throat swabs group at the later stage of illness. Moreover, most of these cases with undetectable viral RNA in throat swabs specimens at the early stage of illness were able to be IgM/IgG seropositive after 7 days. The antibodies detection against SARS-CoV-2 offers vital clinical information for physicians, and could be used as an effective supplementary indicator .

Efforts to control future SARS outbreaks depend on the accurate and early identification of SARS-CoV infected patients. A real-time fluorogenic RT-PCR assay based on the 3 -noncoding region (3 -NCR) of SARS-CoV genome was developed as a quantitative SARS diagnostic tool. The ideal amplification efficiency of a sensitive SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay should yield an E value (PCR product concentration increase per amplification cycle) equal to 2.0. It was demonstrated that the 3 -NCR SARS-CoV based RT-PCR reactions could be formulated to reach excellent E values of 1.81, or 91% amplification efficacy. The SARS-CoV cDNA preparations derived from viral RNA extract and the cloned recombinant plasmid both exhibit the identical amplification characteristics, i.e. amplification efficacy using the same PCR formulation developed in this study. The viral genomic copy (or genomic equivalences, GE) per infectious unit (GE/pfu) of SARS-CoV used in this study was also established to be approximate 1200-1600:1. The assay's detection sensitivity could reach 0.005 pfu or 6-8 GE per assay. It was preliminarily demonstrated that the assay could efficiently detect SARS-CoV from clinical specimens of SARS probable and suspected patients identified in Taiwan. The 3 -NCR based SARS-CoV assay demonstrated 100% diagnostic specificity testing samples of patients with acute respiratory disease from a non-SARS epidemic region.

input: Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with a suspension of Trypanosoma brucei brucei. An early induction of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens as well as an infiltration of macrophage-like cells and cytotoxic T-cells was detected with immunohistochemical techniques in circumventricular organs, such as the median eminence, neurohypophysis, subfornical organ, pineal gland and area postrema. These areas, which lack a blood-brain barrier, correspond to those showing early invasion of trypanosomes. In addition, there was a marked induction of MHC class I in neurons in two hypothalamic nuclei, the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. Neurons in these two nuclei are located behind the blood-brain barrier, but project to the neurohypophysis and to the median eminence, thereby exposing their axon terminals to factors circulating in the blood or released locally from invading trypanosomes or from macrophages or cytotoxic T-cells. It is suggested that the alteration in the nerve cell bodies in the hypothalamic nuclei is caused by retrograde axonal signals from these target areas.

input: Objectives. Assess how people perceive the risks of coronavirus infection, whether people take preventive measures, and which (pre-outbreak) factors contribute to the perceived risks and measures taken, such as (pre-outbreak) respiratory problems, heart problems, diabetes, anxiety and depression symptoms, loneliness, age, gender, marital status and education level. Methods. Data were collected in the longitudinal LISS panel, based on a random sample of the Dutch population. The coronavirus survey started on March 2, and the data collection ended on March 17 2020. Data were linked with surveys on health and social integration conducted at the end of 2019 (N study sample =3,540). Results. About 15% perceived the risk of infection as high, and 11% the risk becoming ill when infected. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed the following. Older age-groups perceived the risk for coronavirus infection as lower (all adjusted Odd Ratio's [aOR] ≤ .058). In total, 43.8% had taken preventive measures, especially females (aOR=1.47, 95% CI=1.27-1.69). Those with lower education levels less often used preventive measures (aOR=0.56, 95% CI=0.46-0.69). Those with preoutbreak respiratory problems (aOR=2.89, 95% CI=2.24-3.73), heart problems (aOR=2.17, 95% CI=1.49-3.16) and diabetes (aOR=3.10, 95% CI=2.02-4.74) perceived the risk becoming ill when infected as higher than others. However, respondents with pre-outbreak respiratory problems and diabetes did not more often take preventive measures. Vulnerable patients more often recognize that they are at risk becoming ill when infected by the coronavirus, but many do not take preventive measures. Interventions to stimulate the use of preventive measures should pay additional attention to physically vulnerable patients, men and those with lower education levels.

input: Ten reference genes were investigated for normalization of gene expression data in the shell gland of laying hens. Analyses performed with geNorm revealed that hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) and hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) were the two most stable reference genes in response to post-oviposition time alone (POT) or with nicarbazin treatment (POT+N) of laying hens. NormFinder analyses showed that the two most stable reference genes in response to POT and POT+N were 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA), ribosomal protein L4 (RPL4) and HMBS, RPL4, respectively. BestKeeper analyses showed that 18S rRNA, RPL4 and HPRT1, HMBS were the two most stable reference genes for POT, and POT+N, respectively. Of the ten reference genes, all except B2M showed geNorm M <0.5, suggesting that they were stably expressed in the shell gland tissue. Consensus from these three programs suggested HPRT1 and HMBS could be used as the two most stable reference genes in the present study. Expression analyses of four candidate target genes with the two most and the two least stable genes showed that a combination of stable reference genes leads to more discriminable quantification of expression levels of target genes, while the least stable genes failed to do so. Therefore, HMBS and HPRT1 are recommended as the two most stable reference genes for the normalization of gene expression data at different stages of eggshell formation in brown-egg laying hens. Available statistical programs for reference gene ranking should include more robust analysis capability to analyse the gene expression data generated from factorial design experiments.

The unpredictable and variable course of CDV-related disease may hamper correct diagnosis of infection and makes it crucial the collection of samples suitable for laboratory confirmation. In the present study we were able to follow the disease in two dogs infected naturally, collecting different biological matrices during the entire period of infection. By real time RT-PCR, viral RNA was detected and quantified, suggesting that urine and rectal swabs would be useful for ante-mortem diagnosis of distemper in dogs, regardless of the clinical stage and form of the illness.

input: Most epidemiological studies of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been conducted in western countries, and studies in Asia are limited. The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence, in-hospital mortality, and 1-year mortality of ARDS in Taiwan. We conducted a nationwide inpatient cohort study based on the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between 1997 and 2011. A total of 40,876 ARDS patients (68% male; mean age 66 years) were identified by International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition coding and further analyzed for clinical characteristics, medical costs, and mortality. The overall crude incidence of ARDS was 15.74 per 100,000 person-years, and increased from 2.53 to 19.26 per 100,000 personyears during the study period. The age-adjusted incidence of ARDS was 15.19 per 100,000 person-years. The overall in-hospital mortality was 57.8%. In-hospital mortality decreased from 59.7% in 1997 to 47.5% in 2011 (P < 0.001). The in-hospital mortality rate was lowest (33.5%) in the youngest patients (age 18-29 years) and highest (68.2%) in the oldest patients (>80 years, P < 0.001). The overall 1-year mortality rate was 72.1%, and decreased from 75.8% to 54.7% during the study period. Patients who died during hospitalization were older (69 AE 17 versus 62 AE 19, P < 0.001) and predominantly male (69.8% versus 65.3%, P < 0.001). In addition, patients who died during hospitalization had significantly higher medical costs (6421 versus 5825 US Dollars, P < 0.001) and shorter lengths of stay (13 versus 19 days, P < 0.001) than patients who survived. We provide the first large-scale epidemiological analysis of ARDS incidence and outcomes in Asia. Although the overall incidence was lower than has been reported in a prospective US study, this may reflect underdiagnosis by International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition code and identification of only patients with more severe ARDS in this analysis. Overall, there has been a decreasing trend in in-hospital and 1year mortality rates in recent years, likely because of the implementation of lung-protective ventilation.

input: The original scientifi c strategy behind vaccinology has historically been to ""isolate, inactivate, and inject,"" fi rst invoked by Louis Pasteur. The recombinant DNA and nanotechnology did much enlarge the repertoire on vaccines, which is today based on three adjusted principles, attenuation, inactivation, and recombination, as shown in Fig. 9 .1 . The three principles are regarded as equal, and all experimental possibilities for a new vaccine development against a pathogen should be studied in detail. The recombinant DNA and nanotechnology did not change the basic scientifi c strategy: live and non-live vaccines. Live vaccines are non-adjuvanted, and non-live vaccines are generally adjuvanted. New developments against tuberculosis (TB) highlight this broad experimental approach: Today, it estimated that about one-third of the world population is infected with the TB bacillus. Approximately 54 million people are infected every year, 9.4 million develop the disease, and 1.7 million die from this curable disease. The TB bacillus kills more people than any other infectious agent alone. Currently, BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) is the only vaccine recommended by the WHO, with more than three billion doses administered since its introduction in 1921. BCG is prepared from a strain of the attenuated live bovine tuberculosis bacillus, Mycobacterium bovis , which lost its virulence in humans by being specially subcultured in an artifi cial medium. However, although it protects newborns and children from severe forms of TB, its effi cacy against pulmonary TB in adolescents and adults is far from optimal, with protection rates varying between 0 and 80 % according to the geographical area.

input: Background: Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB) is a common condition, with substantial associated costs and morbidity. Research efforts have focused on innovations that will reduce the morbidity associated with AECB. Health care payers increasingly expect that the results of evidence-based economic evaluations will guide practitioners in their choice of cost-effective interventions. Objectives: To provide a framework on which to base effective and efficient antimicrobial therapy for AECB, we present a concise clinical review of AECB, followed by an assessment of the available data on the economic impact of this disease. We then address several AECB-specific issues that must be considered in cost-effectiveness analyses of AECB antimicrobial interventions. Methods: Published literature on the clinical and economic impact of AECB was identified using MEDLINE@, pre-MEDLlNE@, HealthSTAR, ClNAHL, Current Contents/All Editions, EMBASE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts databases. Other potential sources were identified by searching for references in retrieved articles, review articles, consensus statements, and articles written by selected authorities. Results: In evaluating cost-effectiveness analyses of AECB antimicrobial therapy it is critical to (1) use the disease-free interval as an outcome measure, (2) evaluate the sequence of multiple therapies, (3) address the impact of both current and future antibiotic resistance, and (4) measure all appropriate AECB-associated costs, both direct and indirect. Incorporating these approaches in economic analyses of AECB antimicrobial therapy can help health care organizations make evidence-based decisions regarding the cost-effective management of AECB.

input: Vesicle-mediated transport is a process carried out by virtually every cell and is required for the proper targeting and secretion of proteins. As such, there are numerous players involved to ensure that the proteins are properly localized. Overall, transport requires vesicle budding, recognition of the vesicle by the target membrane and fusion of the vesicle with the target membrane resulting in delivery of its contents. The initial interaction between the vesicle and the target membrane has been referred to as tethering. Because this is the first contact between the two membranes, tethering is critical to ensuring that specificity is achieved. It is therefore not surprising that there are numerous 'tethering factors' involved ranging from multisubunit complexes, coiled-coil proteins and Rab guanosine triphosphatases. Of the multisubunit tethering complexes, one of the best studied at the molecular level is the evolutionarily conserved TRAPP complex. There are two forms of this complex: TRAPP I and TRAPP II. In yeast, these complexes function in a number of processes including endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport (TRAPP I) and an ill-defined step at the trans Golgi (TRAPP II). Because the complex was first reported in 1998 (1), there has been a decade of studies that have clarified some aspects of its function but have also raised further questions.

input: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic originating from China in 2002 was caused by a previously uncharacterized coronavirus that could be identified by specific RT-PCR amplification. Efforts to control future SARS outbreaks depend on the accurate and early identification of SARS-CoV infected patients. A real-time fluorogenic RT-PCR assay based on the 3 -noncoding region (3 -NCR) of SARS-CoV genome was developed as a quantitative SARS diagnostic tool. The ideal amplification efficiency of a sensitive SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay should yield an E value (PCR product concentration increase per amplification cycle) equal to 2.0. It was demonstrated that the 3 -NCR SARS-CoV based RT-PCR reactions could be formulated to reach excellent E values of 1.81, or 91% amplification efficacy. The SARS-CoV cDNA preparations derived from viral RNA extract and the cloned recombinant plasmid both exhibit the identical amplification characteristics, i.e. amplification efficacy using the same PCR formulation developed in this study. The viral genomic copy (or genomic equivalences, GE) per infectious unit (GE/pfu) of SARS-CoV used in this study was also established to be approximate 1200-1600:1. The assay's detection sensitivity could reach 0.005 pfu or 6-8 GE per assay. It was preliminarily demonstrated that the assay could efficiently detect SARS-CoV from clinical specimens of SARS probable and suspected patients identified in Taiwan. The 3 -NCR based SARS-CoV assay demonstrated 100% diagnostic specificity testing samples of patients with acute respiratory disease from a non-SARS epidemic region.

input: Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are cysteine protease proteins that reverse the ubiquitination by removing ubiquitins from the target protein. With over 100 DUBs identified and categorized into at least 7 families, many DUBs interact with one or more cytokines, influencing cellular processes, such as antiviral responses, inflammatory responses, apoptosis, etc. While some DUBs influence cytokine pathway or production, some DUBs are cytokine-inducible. In this article, we summarize a list of DUBs, their interaction with cytokines, target proteins and mechanisms of action.

input: For over 30 years, HIV/AIDS has wreaked havoc in the world. In the absence of an effective vaccine for HIV, development of new anti-HIV agents is urgently needed. We previously identified the antiviral activities of the scorpion-venom-peptidederived mucroporin-M1 for three RNA viruses (measles viruses, SARS-CoV, and H5N1). In this investigation, a panel of scorpion venom peptides and their derivatives were designed and chosen for assessment of their anti-HIV activities. A new scorpion venom peptide derivative Kn2-7 was identified as the most potent anti-HIV-1 peptide by screening assays with an EC 50 value of 2.76 mg/ml (1.65 mM) and showed low cytotoxicity to host cells with a selective index (SI) of 13.93. Kn2-7 could inhibit all members of a standard reference panel of HIV-1 subtype B pseudotyped virus (PV) with CCR5-tropic and CXCR4tropic NL4-3 PV strain. Furthermore, it also inhibited a CXCR4-tropic replication-competent strain of HIV-1 subtype B virus. Binding assay of Kn2-7 to HIV-1 PV by Octet Red system suggested the anti-HIV-1 activity was correlated with a direct interaction between Kn2-7 and HIV-1 envelope. These results demonstrated that peptide Kn2-7 could inhibit HIV-1 by direct interaction with viral particle and may become a promising candidate compound for further development of microbicide against HIV-1.

input: lung transplantation and thought to represent chronic rejection. Increased expression of Pentraxin 3 (PTX3), an acute phase protein, was associated with worse outcome in lung transplant patients. To determine the role of recipient PTX3 in development of chronic rejection, we used a minor alloantigen-mismatched murine orthotopic single lung transplant model. Male C57BL/10 mice were used as donors. Male PTX3 knockout (KO) mice and their wild type (WT) littermates on 129/SvEv/C57BL6/J background were used as recipients. In KO recipients, 7/13 grafted lungs were consolidated without volume recovery on CT scan, while only 2/9 WT mice showed similar graft consolidation. For grafts where lung volume could be reliably analyzed by CT scan, the lung volume recovery was significantly reduced in KO mice compared to WT. Interstitial inflammation, parenchymal fibrosis and bronchiolitis obliterans scores were significantly higher in KO mice. Presence of myofibroblasts and lymphoid aggregation was significantly enhanced in the grafts of PTX3 KO recipients. Recipient PTX3 deficiency enhanced chronic rejection-like lesions by promoting a fibrotic process in the airways and lung parenchyma. The underlying mechanisms and potential protective role of exogenous PTX3 as a therapy should be further explored.

Now complete the following example-
input: The current emergence of the novel coronavirus pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 demands the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent rapid progress of mortalities. The coronavirus spike (S) protein, which facilitates viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion is heavily glycosylated and plays a critical role in the elicitation of the host immune response. The spike protein is comprised of two protein subunits (S1 and S2), which together possess 22 potential N-glycosylation sites. Herein, we report the glycosylation mapping on spike protein subunits S1 and S2 expressed on human cells through high resolution mass spectrometry. We have characterized the quantitative N-glycosylation profile on spike protein and interestingly, observed unexpected O-glycosylation modifications on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein subunit S1. Even though O-glycosylation has been predicted on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, this is the first report of experimental data for both the site of O-glycosylation and identity of the O-glycans attached on the subunit S1. Our data on the N-and O-glycosylation is strengthened by extensive manual interpretation of each glycopeptide spectra in addition to using bioinformatics tools to confirm the complexity of glycosylation in the spike protein. The elucidation of the glycan repertoire on the spike protein provides insights into the viral binding studies and more importantly, propels research towards the development of a suitable vaccine candidate. author/funder.

Now complete the following example-
input: A tryptophan-rich octapeptide, C8 (Ac-Trp-Glu-Asp-Trp-Val-Gly-Trp-Ile-NH 2 ), modelled on the membrane-proximal external region of the feline immuno-deWciency virus (FIV) gp36 glycoprotein ectodomain, exhibits potent antiviral activity against FIV. A mechanism has been proposed by which the peptide, being positioned on the surface of the cell membrane, inhibits its fusion with the virus. In the present work, peptide-lipid interactions of C8 with dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine liposomes are investigated using electron spin resonance spectroscopy of spin-labelled lipids. Three other peptides, obtained from modiWcations of C8, have also been investigated, in an attempt to clarify the essential molecular features of the interactions involving the tryptophan residues. The results show that C8 adsorbs strongly on the bilayer surface. Membrane binding requires not only the presence of the Trp residues in the sequence, but also their common orientation on one side of the peptide that is engendered by the WX 2 WX 2 W motif. Membrane interaction correlates closely with peptide antiviral activity, indicating that the membrane is essential in stabilizing the peptide conformation that will be able to inhibit viral infection.

input: The porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, causes acute diarrhoea and dehydration in pigs. Although it was first identified in Europe, it has become increasingly problematic in many Asian countries, including Korea, China, Japan, the Philippines, and Thailand. The economic impacts of the PEDV are substantial, given that it results in significant morbidity and mortality in neonatal piglets and is associated with increased costs related to vaccination and disinfection. Recently, progress has been made in understanding the molecular epidemiology of PEDV, thereby leading to the development of new vaccines. In the current review, we first describe the molecular and genetic characteristics of the PEDV. Then we discuss its molecular epidemiology and diagnosis, what vaccines are available, and how PEDV can be treated.

input: General agreement exists effective disaster management faces constraints related to knowledge sharing and a need for real-time research responses. Extreme case examples of disasters especially vulnerable to these challenges are global pandemics, or disease outbreaks, in which data required for research response are only available after the start of an outbreak. This paper argues the developing field of probabilistic innovation (innovation increasing probability of solving societal problems through radically increasing coordination of volumes of problem-solving inputs and analysis), and its methodologies, such as those drawing from crowdsourced R&D and social media, may offer useful insights into enabling real time research capabilities, with important implications for disaster and crisis management. Three paradigms of disaster research are differentiated, as literature is related to theory offered by post normal science, Kuhnian 'normal science' and Lakatosian 'structural science,' and the goal of achieving real time research problem solving capacity in disaster crisis situations. Global collaborative innovation platforms and large-scale investments in emerging crowdsourced R&D and social media technologies together with synthesis of appropriate theory may contribute to improved real time disaster response and resilience across contexts, particularly in instances where data required to manage response is only available after disasters unfold.

Now complete the following example-
input: Recombinant proteins are traditionally limited to linear configuration. Herein, we report in vivo protein topology engineering using highly efficient, mechanically interlocking SpyX modules named AXB and BXA. SpyX modules are protein domains composed of p53dim (X), SpyTag (A), and SpyCatcher (B). The p53dim guides the intertwining of the two nascent protein chains followed by autocatalytic isopeptide bond formation between SpyTag and SpyCatcher to fulfill the interlocking, leading to a variety of backbone topologies. Direct expression of AXB or BXA produces protein catenanes with distinct ring sizes. Recombinant proteins containing SpyX modules are obtained either as mechanically interlocked obligate dimers if the protein of interest is fused to the N-or C-terminus of SpyX modules, or as star proteins if the protein is fused to both N-and C-termini. As examples, cellular syntheses of dimers of (GB1) 2 (where GB1 stands for immunoglobulin-binding domain B1 of streptococcal protein G) and of four-arm elastin-like star proteins were demonstrated. Comparison of the catenation efficiencies in different constructs reveals that BXA is generally much more effective than AXB, which is rationalized by the arrangement of three domains in space. Mechanical interlocking induces considerable stability enhancement. Both AXB and BXA have a melting point ∼20°C higher than the linear controls and the BXA catenane has a melting point~2°C higher than the cyclic control BX'A. Notably, four-arm elastin-like star proteins demonstrate remarkable tolerance against trypsin digestion. The SpyX modules provide a convenient and versatile approach to construct unconventional protein topologies via the ""assembly-reaction"" synergy, which opens a new horizon in protein science for stability enhancement and function reinforcement via topology engineering.
