input: Benavidez  defends title: On the televised undercard   21-year-old WBC super middleweight champion David Benavidez  successfully defended  his  title for the first time by outslugging Ronald Gavril in a rematch of their first meeting last September. Benavidez  who won by unanimous decision  remains the youngest champion in boxing.
 Benavidez  punished Gavril from the opening bell  landing effective combinations throughout the fight. By the time it was over  Gavril's face and white trunks were soaked with blood  but the Romanian fighter fought back until the final bell.  Benavidez  scored a near unanimous shutout  winning by scores of 119-109 and 120-108 twice.
 Benavidez  did not use  his  right hand at all for the last few rounds  throwing mostly left jabs  and revealed a badly swollen right knuckle after the fight. The Phoenix fighter improved to 20-0 (17 KOs)  while Gavril fell to 18-3 (14 KOs).
âI knew  he  was going to come aggressive.  He âs a one-trick opponent ""  Benavidez  said. ""I knew I could jab and box  him  all day. When I saw the opening I took it. I didnât knock  him  out though â  he âs a tough son of a gun.

input: Joseph Boeckmann  later became a district judge at Wynne in eastern Arkansas  then for years preyed on men misfortunate enough to land in  his  courtroom. The federal government says  he  deserves a 37-month prison term for a pattern of misconduct that involved  him  demanding overtly sexual acts â at the prosecutor's office until  he  was run off and later from the bench  even though  his  criminal charges involve only  his  behavior as a judge.
""It can be fairly inferred that the defendant's goal in running for his judicial position was to once again have access to young men in vulnerable positions "" government lawyers wrote before Wednesday's sentencing hearing. An FBI agent is prepared to detail two investigations into  Boeckmann 's having at least seven young men pose for him â some nude â in return for a reduced bond or the outright dropping of criminal charges.
""The similarity between the accounts given by the young men who the FBI interviewed in the previous case and the young men interviewed as part of the (current) case are striking and demonstrate the defendant's clear and continuous pattern of abuse dating back at least 20 years "" the government lawyers wrote in asking U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker to also consider  Boeckmann 's misbehavior as a deputy prosecutor in the 1990s.
But the ex-judge's lawyer  Jeff Rosenzweig  said it would be unfair to cite the older claims because  Boeckmann 's failing health and memory would make it impossible to refute them. He said home detention would be appropriate for ""an elderly  broken  ailing man.""
In 2016  as it investigated  Boeckmann 's behavior as a judge  The Associated Press filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking documents related to the previous investigations. The FBI denied the AP's request  citing a right to privacy. The AP was denied again on appeal.
Prosecuting Attorney Fletcher Long told an AP reporter in 2016 that his office did not have a copy of  Boeckmann 's letter of resignation. When asked about the previous investigation  he said he did not recall allegations involving  Boeckmann . Long was traveling Tuesday and did not return a call to his office seeking comment.
The government's filing said the U.S. Attorney's Office declined to prosecute  Boeckmann  in the 1990s because  he  had agreed to resign as deputy prosecutor.
The U.S. Attorney at Little Rock then was Paula Casey  who recently retired as dean of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock law school. She said Tuesday she didn't recall the previous  Boeckmann  investigations but that any decision in her office to bring a civil rights or public integrity case â or to decline one â would have also gone through the U.S. Justice Department. A message left with the current U.S. attorney's office was not returned.

 The Navi Mumbai airport  which has been planned some 30 kilometers away from the current Chattrapati Shivaji airport in Mumbai  had been a contentious issue because of its environmental impact due to its location. But  the Indian Environment Ministry finally cleared the project.
 Claiming that the plans for the airport have been modified so that one river instead of two will be diverted  the minister said: ""River Gadhi would not be diverted to make way for the airport and added that 161 hectares of mangroves would fall under Navi Mumbai airport.""
 and added that 161 hectares of mangroves would fall under Navi Mumbai airport.""
 ""We cannot leave aside the environmental concerns and Navi Mumbai airport sanction is classic example of respecting the norms. This should be the same for all mega projects. The Navi Mumbai airport clearance is crucial for Maharashtra. Relocation of some 3  000 families will be done at a fast pace. Some forest clearance is awaited but should not be a problem "" Chavan said.

Now complete the following example-
input: The statement said the couple will live in Nottingham Cottage at Kensington Palace. Harry and  Markle âs upcoming wedding will be the first grand royal wedding since Prince William and Kate Middleton got married in 2011.
William and Kate  who is expecting her third child  said in a statement they are excited for the couple  adding that âit has been wonderful getting to know  Meghan  and to see how happy  she  and Harry are together.""
 Markle   best known for  her  role as an ambitious paralegal in the hit U.S. legal drama ""Suits "" surprised many when  she  shared  her  feelings for Harry in a September cover story for Vanity Fair. Asked about the media frenzy surrounding their courtship  the 36-year-old said: ""At the end of the day I think it's really simple ... we're two people who are really happy and in love.""
Describing Harry as her ""boyfriend  "" Markle  said that while  she  expected that  she  and Harry would have to ""come forward"" about their relationship at some point  the two were just a couple enjoying time spent with each other.
""Personally  I love a great love story ""  she  said.
 Markle 's Vanity Fair interview broke new ground. It is unusual for a royal love interest to speak so publicly -- and candidly -- before becoming engaged. Harry's past reported girlfriends all shied away from the media limelight  and his sister-in-law  formerly known as Kate Middleton  stayed silent until she and Prince William gave a formal televised interview at Buckingham Palace after their engagement became public.
But then  unlike some other ""commoners"" romantically linked to Britain's royals   Markle  is no stranger to media exposure and the world of show business.
The actress's most successful role is the feisty Rachel Zane in the TV legal show ""Suits "" now in its seventh season.  Her  career has included small parts on TV series including ""Fringe "" ""CSI: Miami "" ""Knight Rider"" and ""Castle "" as well as movies such as ""Horrible Bosses."" Outside of acting   Markle  founded a lifestyle blog called TheTig.com (which closed down in April without explanation)  and has lent  her  celebrity status to humanitarian causes.
 She  has campaigned with the United Nations on gender equality  written in Time magazine about girls' education and the stigma surrounding menstruation  and has traveled to Rwanda as global ambassador for the charity World Vision Canada.  She  has described how  her  mother took  her  to the slums of Jamaica to witness poverty first-hand  saying experiences like that shaped  her  social consciousness and charity work.
To some degree that mirrors the experience of Harry  who was also inspired by his mother's humanitarian work and embraced the types of charities Diana favored in the final years of  her  life before  her  1997 death in a Paris car crash.
Harry and  Markle  held hands for their first official appearance together in September in Toronto at the Invictus Games  a sporting event for wounded service personnel that Harry spearheaded.
Both were dressed casually in jeans  smiling and chatting as they arrived for a tennis match. Several days later  Harry was photographed kissing  Markle  on the cheek as he joined the actress and  her  mother in a luxury box to watch the event's closing ceremony.
 Markle  said  she  met Harry through friends in London in July 2016  and that they had been dating quietly for several months before the romance hit the headlines.
Some tabloids had alluded to  Markle 's mixed-race heritage  pointing out  she  has an African-American mother and a white father.
 Markle  herself has spoken out about coming to terms with being biracial -- both growing up  and in  her  Hollywood career.
In a March interview with Allure magazine   she  said studying race at college was ""the first time I could put a name to feeling too light in the black community and too mixed in the white community.

input: In a letter posted on the White House web site Tuesday  John Brennan  assistant to President Barack Obama for homeland security and counterterrorism  said Schmidt will have regular access to the president and play a vital role in the country's security.
 Schmidt's selection comes more than 10 months after Obama declared cyber security a priority and ordered a broad administration review.
 A senior White House official said Obama was personally involved in the selection process and chose Schmidt because of his unique background and skills. Schmidt will have regular and direct access to the president for cyber security issues  the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the selection process.
 At the same time  cyber experts and potential job candidates have complained that the position lacks the budgetary and policy-making authority needed to be successful. Schmidt will report to the National Security Council and closely support the National Economic Council on cyber issues.
 Schmidt's selection suggests that economic and business interests in the White House held more sway in the selection process. Schmidt  president and CEO of the Information Security Forum  a nonprofit international consortium that conducts research in information security  has served as chief security officer for Microsoft and as cyber security chief for online auction giant eBay. He was reportedly preferred by Lawrence Summers  director of the economic council. A good format for the titel can be the simple subject + object + verb.

 Baraka  says  he  was leaving  his  practice that evening when  he  saw what  he  calls ""patient dumping"" in action.
""At first I was shocked ""  he  told The Associated Press. ""I couldn't believe what I was seeing. And I move beyond that to the next level from being shocked. I became … irritated and fearful for the young lady. And then I became angry.""
 He  quickly grabbed  his  cell phone to document the scene.
 Baraka   a psychotherapist in the area  says he hopes this unfortunate incident will open up a discussion of mental health in this country.
