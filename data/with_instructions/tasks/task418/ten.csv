input: In a letter posted on the White House web site Tuesday  John Brennan  assistant to President Barack Obama for homeland security and counterterrorism  said Schmidt will have regular access to the president and play a vital role in the country's security.
 Schmidt's selection comes more than 10 months after Obama declared cyber security a priority and ordered a broad administration review.
 A senior White House official said Obama was personally involved in the selection process and chose Schmidt because of his unique background and skills. Schmidt will have regular and direct access to the president for cyber security issues  the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the selection process.
 At the same time  cyber experts and potential job candidates have complained that the position lacks the budgetary and policy-making authority needed to be successful. Schmidt will report to the National Security Council and closely support the National Economic Council on cyber issues.
 Schmidt's selection suggests that economic and business interests in the White House held more sway in the selection process. Schmidt  president and CEO of the Information Security Forum  a nonprofit international consortium that conducts research in information security  has served as chief security officer for Microsoft and as cyber security chief for online auction giant eBay. He was reportedly preferred by Lawrence Summers  director of the economic council. A good format for the titel can be the simple subject + object + verb.

input: The clock has finally run out for an Upper East Side judge who ridiculed a lawyer with cerebral palsy and allowed cases involving tenants without heat or hot water to drag on   sources told The Post . The Manhattan Housing Court ’ s advisory council   which reviews its judges after each four - year term   recently ruled that jurist Susan Avery should get the boot — as it catalogued years of complaints against her   sources said . Avery ’ s chief - judge boss is now set to follow through on the recommendation by the end of the year   sources said . “ Considering the complaints against her   it ’ s about time for her to leave the bench  ” said Alan Flacks   a longtime local resident pushing for judicial reform . Avery   52   of East 84th Street   landed her $ 175   000 - a - year job in 2012 thanks to a political appointment by then - Chief Judge Gail Prudenti . But she started demonstrating poor judgment almost immediately from the bench   according to the 14 - member Advisory Council for the Housing Part of the Civil Court of New York City . In 2013   Avery reprimanded a lawyer with cerebral palsy for his sloppy handwriting   the panel said in its four - page finding   which called the judge “ unfeeling .’’ The incident resulted in a letter of caution being placed in Avery ’ s file   according to a court source . The council — comprised of representatives from both the real - estate industry and tenants ’ organizations appointed by the mayor and governor — also criticized Avery for “ excessive multi - week adjournments ” for cases involving lack of heat and hot water   said the letter   a copy of which was read to The Post . The advisory council said in its decision last month that the New York Law School grad showed a general “ lack of concern ” for the litigants before her . The council added it was “ disturbed further ” by conflicts of interests involving the Housing Court judge ’ s family real - estate holdings . A court source said  Avery  failed to disclose that a law firm administering a family trust also regularly represents landlords in cases before the judge . Meanwhile   the jurist garnered a “ not approved ” rating by the city Bar Association — twice . Voters also refused to back her two bids to move up to civil court . In the summer of 2016    a judge who was running against Avery for a civil - court position  lodged a complaint over her campaign tactics . Justice Sabrina Kraus   who was appointed to the bench in 2005   accused Avery ’ s boyfriend of making derogatory comments about her Iranian heritage on Facebook .  Avery  failed to disavow the remarks   showing ethnic bias   the advisory panel added . Kraus beat  Avery  to win the seat .  Avery  ran for civil court again this year but lost in the September primary .  Avery  did not respond to multiple requests for comment . The former chief judge who appointed her   Prudenti   said she had no memory of choosing her .

Who:  Cara  and Jesse Nuno
How much: $272 261 in five years 
Cara  and  Jesse Nuno  (Photo: NerdWallet.com)
Six years ago   Cara  and  Jesse Nuno  could not imagine a debt-free life.
 Cara : I think I had suggested [going to a credit counselor] in the past  but at the time Jess was too proud to talk to  them .
Jesse: In 2012  I can’t remember if we saw the advertisement [for the agency] on TV or not  but somehow it just kinda clicked  so we went to  them .  They  gave us April’s number.
April (credit counselor): The majority of  their  debt was old and in collections  so they were really at the “cleanup stage” and [handling each debt] one at a time more than all together. They used a mix of different techniques to address the collections. Some needed to be disputed as already paid or invalid. They also had some that appeared to be past the statute of limitations  so they first needed to verify this with an attorney and then dispute. Others they settled on  but most they made paid in full.
 Cara :  We  kept looking each month at what  we  had and the progress  we  had made. Slowly but surely  as  we  disputed and paid down  our  debts   our  credit scores went up.
 Jesse : Same for me. I was looking forward to the future where one day   we ’d be able to buy things again.
April: When  Jesse  and Cara first came to me in 2012  their credit scores were 536 and 584  respectively. As of 2016  Cara’s was 667 and  Jesse ’s was 758.
 Jesse : I seem to be sleeping better at night  not tossing and turning like I used to  figuring how I’m going to pay this or how I’m going to pay that. It takes its toll — I got the gray hair to prove it.
 Cara :  We ’d like to do some work on the house and get  our  vehicles paid off. Now  we  have a budget  and Jess pays all  our  bills early.
 Cara : It’s OK to ask for counseling to get started with a plan to get your debt paid off. Don’t be embarrassed to ask for help because you’re not the only person that’s been there.

 McHugh could not be reached for comment. His attorney  Greg Stannard  said he had not had time to review the case and could not comment.
 McHugh is under a court order to sell all his rental properties in Los Angeles by the fall of 2010 as part of a plea agreement to avoid jail time for fire and habitability violations.
 City officials have been trying to regulate McHugh for decades. In the 1980s  then-City Attorney Ira Reiner accused McHugh  now 84  of dealing in ""blood money"" and threatened to put him in jail.
 But the landlord continued to amass buildings and a record of violating health and safety codes. Last summer  his lawyer told city officials that he owned more than 140 properties  housing about 8 000 people  many of them impoverished immigrants in the city's core.
 Tenants and their advocates say the conditions in his buildings caused health risks such as lead poisoning  asthma and ear infections caused by allergy to cockroaches.

 Judge Roy Moore  speaks as  he  participates in the Mid-Alabama Republican Club's Veterans Day Program in Vestavia Hills  Alabama  U.S.  November 11  2017. REUTERS/Marvin Gentry
Trump’s position did not go as far as other Republican leaders in Washington who have said they believe the women accusing the former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice and have demanded  Moore  withdraw from the race before the Dec. 12 vote.
“The president said in his statement earlier this week that if the allegations are true  then  Roy Moore  should step aside. He still firmly believes that ” she said.
Asked if the president’s endorsement of  Moore  still stands  Sanders said Trump thinks Alabama voters should decide the winner of the race.
In the past week  multiple women have accused  Moore  of sexual improprieties or unwanted romantic advances they said occurred decades ago. Some of the women were teenagers at the time  and he was in his 30s.
Before the allegations surfaced   Moore  was heavily favored to defeat Democrat Doug Jones in the special election next month.
 Moore  scored a decisive Republican primary victory in September over Luther Strange  who was appointed to fill the vacant seat after Jeff Sessions became U.S. attorney general earlier this year.
Trump backed Strange in the primary but threw his support to  Moore  after Strange’s defeat.

input: Face masks are placed on children in Antananarivo   Madagascar   on Tuesday . ( Alexander Joe / Associated Press ) Some might consider the plague a thing of the past   buried deep in medieval history . But it thrives in Madagascar   where the disease is a seasonal worry . And this year   the country is experiencing what may be its deadliest outbreak in years : About 194 people are suspected to have fallen ill from the plague since August   and 33 have died as of Saturday   according to Madagascar ’ s Ministry of Health . Experts say they can ’ t remember the last time the death toll was so high . In 2016   63 people died over the course of the year   out of 275 cases . The majority of this year ’ s cases are pneumonic plague   which can be transmitted through coughing   according to the BBC . This form of the disease can kill an infected person in less than a day . To slow the outbreak   Madagascar is temporarily shutting down its public institutions . Government authorities ordered two universities to close   and other schools have shut their doors across the country   including the capital   Antananarivo   so buildings can be sprayed with insecticides . The World Health Organization has shipped more than a million doses of antibiotics to the country   the BBC reported . “ We are scared — all of these deaths show that the situation is serious  ” Miora Herinjatovo   55   told Agence France - Presse on Wednesday . She got a mask from a hospital — unlike her husband   who failed to get one after standing in line outside a pharmacy . He instead collected a handful of generic antibiotics . [ The plague   alive and well in Madagascar ] Experts say the outbreak started in late August   when a 31 - year - old man from the eastern city of Toamasina took a trip inland to Ankazobe   where the plague lives in rodent and flea populations . While there   he came down with malaria - like symptoms . He died in a taxi home   passing through Antananarivo   the WHO said in a Sept . 28 statement . The WHO said that many of the cases identified are directly or indirectly linked to the man   which is evidence of person - to - person transmission . Of the 31 people who made direct or indirect contact with him   four became ill and died   the WHO said . Antananarivo and Toamasina were among the most - infected cities : As of Sept . 30   Antananarivo and its suburbs had 27 cases and seven deaths   and Toamasina had 18 cases and five deaths . Antananarivo has about 1 . 3 million residents   while Toamasina has about 237   000   according to a 2014 count by the National Institute of Statistics in Madagascar . Public gatherings   including jazz festivals and basketball tournaments   have been called off to prevent the plague from spreading   according to media reports . One of the people killed by the plague last week was a basketball coach from the Seychelles   who died while visiting the capital for a tournament   according to a WHO report released Thursday . “ Right now   we have the outbreak of a very infectious   fatal disease  ” said Katharina Kreppel   an epidemiologist at the Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania   who spent four years conducting field research in Madagascar . “ If people don ’ t notice fast enough   or don ’ t have access to health care fast enough   they die very quickly .” [ There ’ s plague in Arizona . Authorities warn of fleas that can infect people and pets .] This plague shares the same bacterium   yersinia pestis   that caused the “ Black Death ” pandemic in Europe during the 14th century . The most common form of the plague in Madagascar was   until this year   the bubonic plague   spread to humans through infected fleas that contracted the infection from small animals they bit   like rats . The disease is typically spread to humans by the bite of an infected flea   according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The bubonic plague is often treatable with antibiotics . If left untreated   though   the bacteria can spread through the bloodstream to the lungs and cause pneumonic plague — a deadly   more infectious form that ’ s now spreading throughout Madagascar . Symptoms of the pneumonic plague are similar to the common cold   according to the CDC . The symptoms of bubonic plague are fever   headaches   chills and weakness — as well as one or more swollen and painful lymph nodes   known as buboes . The bacteria multiply in the lymph node closest to where the bacteria entered the body   usually through the infected flea bite   according to the CDC . If an infected person isn ’ t given antibiotics   the bacteria can spread to other parts of the body . Should the bubonic plague become pneumonic   the person will develop shortness of breath   chest pain and sometimes bloody or watery mucous . The pneumonia may cause respiratory failure and shock . All forms of plague   if untreated   can progress rapidly to death   according to the CDC . There have been three major plague pandemics : The Justinian plague   which broke in the Byzantine Empire in AD 541 ; the “ Black Death  ” which originated in China in 1334 and spread to Europe ; and the Modern Plague   which began in China in the 1860s and appeared in Hong Kong by 1894   according to the CDC . It was during the last pandemic that scientists identified the link between the bacteria and infectious flea bites   and rat - associated plague was soon brought under control in most urban areas . The plague has since been controlled in most countries with insecticides   according to the CDC . And since it can be treated with antibiotics   the spread of the disease is usually prevented if promptly identified . The plague is most commonly found in sub - Saharan Africa and Madagascar   areas which account for more than 95 percent of reported cases   according to the CDC . Madagascar often sees the highest numbers of bubonic plague cases worldwide   about 600 infections annually . Madagascar has been in the throes of a political crisis since 2009 and has become one of the poorest countries in the world   with more than 92 percent of the population living on less than $ 2 a day   according to the World Bank Group . It ’ s lost a substantial portion of international aid   and its infrastructure has deteriorated . Once rice harvest season finishes at the end of summer   the rat population drops   as they don ’ t have as much food . Fleas begin looking for new hosts to bite and settle on humans . As it is an island   Madagascar is home to species that transmit the plague and often aren ’ t found anywhere else    Kreppel  told The Washington Post . While Madagascar ’ s scientists have monitored plague patterns for years and have the knowledge to mitigate the spread of this new   pneumonic plague   the money and resources to do so aren ’ t available    Kreppel  said . There isn ’ t adequate funding for insecticides   spraying equipment or antibiotics   she said   and there aren ’ t enough health facilities to house quarantined patients . The country can ’ t afford the vehicles required to travel to isolated villages   should the disease spread further    Kreppel  said . “ If an outbreak like this happened in the U . S . or Europe or anywhere else it would be controlled quite fast   because the resources are there  ” she said . This post has been updated .

Now complete the following example-
input: But  President Donald J. Trump  hardly looked like a grand wizard a week ago today. On January 8   he  hosted Alveda King  the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; Isaac Newton Farris Jr.  Dr. King’s nephew  and Bruce Levell of the National Diversity Coalition for  Trump . All three of  Trump ’s guests are black.
“I did about 200 cataract surgeries with a group of surgeons in Haiti and the same in Central America ” Senator Paul  an ophthalmologist  said on NBC’s Meet the Press yesterday. “And when we asked  Donald J. Trump  as a private citizen to support those trips   he  was a large financial backer of both medical mission trips.” Paul continued: “I think it’s unfair then to sort of all of a sudden paint him  ‘Oh well   he ’s a racist ’ when I know  for a fact  that  he  cares very deeply about the people in Haiti because  he  helped finance a trip where we were able to get vision back for 200 people in Haiti.”
Whatever  Trump  said or didn’t say  the reaction has been beyond incendiary  with the words “racist” and “racism” erupting like volcanos around the Pacific Ring of Fire.
 Trump’s  alleged language  if uttered  was unfortunate  vulgar  and unpresidential  although  he  hardly would have been the first chief executive to use profanity in office.  His  supposed words apparently were aimed at sh**hole nations  rather than sh**hole people. The latter would have been inexcusable.
It is widely understood that certain nations are garden spots  and others are not. It is fair to say that Haiti  El Salvador  and a tragically high number of African countries are non-garden spots. It also is perfectly appropriate to ask whether America would be better off with immigrants from such impoverished and embattled places or from prosperous nations  such as Norway  which  Trump  reportedly mentioned. It likely was top of mind  given Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg’s visit and joint press conference with him on Wednesday.
Whatever he stated or didn’t   President Trump  should learn these lessons from this experience  and repeat them to  himself  daily:
“Every word I say matters.” This is true in public  in private  and around the clock  until  he  leaves the White House and begins work on the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library.
 Trump  should think of  himself  as Jim Carrey in the 1998 film The Truman Show. Except when  he  is in bed   Trump  should behave as if every breath  he  takes were being broadcast live around the globe.
 Trump  needs to remember that Democrats are not  his  pals. They almost universally crave  his  failure  resist  his  program  and want to yank  him  from office — never mind the 304 votes  he  legitimately won in the Electoral College. Anything  he  says in front of Democrats (and even some Never  Trump  Republicans  alas) can and will be used against  him  in the court of public opinion.  Senator Durbin  should be condemned for publicizing (or distorting)  his  private conversation with  Trump   thus sabotaging efforts to reach a DACA deal. But this should be no more shocking than if  somewhere in Illinois  a rooster crowed at dawn.
 Trump  needs to remember that Democrats are not  his  pals.
Ned Ryun of American Majority has an excellent idea: Whenever  President Trump  meets with Democrats   he  should summon news cameras and let them stay until Democrats leave. Trump displayed his leadership skills to almost universal applause when he allowed the media to broadcast live for 55 minutes from the Cabinet Room  as he negotiated immigration and border security last Tuesday. Doing this regularly when Democrats are around will prevent them from offering journalists an alternative version of events. With cameras present  Trump should be on his best behavior. And the American people will benefit from Senate-floor-like transparency inside the White House. This would be unprecedented and gain Trump considerable respect for opening a virtual sunroof atop the West Wing.
Trump’s job is to recall at all times  with the relentlessness of a bloodhound chasing an escaped Death Row inmate  that he must not give free knives and anvils to people who hate his guts and literally would cheer if he woke up dead tomorrow morning . (And the Left need not bother to deny this. Everyone knows this is true  as evidenced by the Left’s repeated fantasies about Trump being shot  stabbed  and decapitated.) These people would call  Trump  a racist for ordering vanilla ice cream.  He  should remember this without fail and act accordingly.
If  Trump  becomes blurry about this fact   he  should remember the very first fake-news story to emerge on  his  watch. On January 20  during  his  very first day as president  Time magazine’s Zeke Miller reported that Trump removed a bust of Dr. Martin Luther King from the Oval Office. This confirmed that  Trump  was a racist who couldn’t wait to evict that troublemaking black from  his  new office.

input: Miami (AFP) â The NFL confirmed Friday it is investigating an allegation of sexual assault against Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback  Jameis Winston  after a female Uber driver complained of being groped by  the star  last year.
BuzzFeed News reported that the driver had alleged  Winston  grabbed her crotch during a ride in Scottsdale  Arizona in March 2016.  Winston  has denied the allegation.
 Winston  is now being probed by the NFLâs special counsel for investigations  Lisa Friel  who had written to the quarterbackâs accuser.
âThe League has been informed that you may have been the victim of such a violation perpetrated by Tampa Bay Buccaneers player Jameis Winston â Friel wrote in the letter.
 Winston   23  issued a statement in response to the BuzzFeed report  denying the allegations.
âA news organization has published a story about me regarding an alleged incident involving a female Uber driver from approximately two years ago â  Winston  said.
 Winston  is in  his  third season with Tampa Bay after being the top pick in the 2015 draft.
 His  college career had been dogged by controversy  including a 2012 allegation of rape by a fellow student at Florida State.  Winston  did not face charges following the incident.
