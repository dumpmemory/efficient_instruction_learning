input: In a letter posted on the White House web site Tuesday  John Brennan  assistant to President Barack Obama for homeland security and counterterrorism  said Schmidt will have regular access to the president and play a vital role in the country's security.
 Schmidt's selection comes more than 10 months after Obama declared cyber security a priority and ordered a broad administration review.
 A senior White House official said Obama was personally involved in the selection process and chose Schmidt because of his unique background and skills. Schmidt will have regular and direct access to the president for cyber security issues  the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the selection process.
 At the same time  cyber experts and potential job candidates have complained that the position lacks the budgetary and policy-making authority needed to be successful. Schmidt will report to the National Security Council and closely support the National Economic Council on cyber issues.
 Schmidt's selection suggests that economic and business interests in the White House held more sway in the selection process. Schmidt  president and CEO of the Information Security Forum  a nonprofit international consortium that conducts research in information security  has served as chief security officer for Microsoft and as cyber security chief for online auction giant eBay. He was reportedly preferred by Lawrence Summers  director of the economic council. A good format for the titel can be the simple subject + object + verb.

input: The clock has finally run out for an Upper East Side judge who ridiculed a lawyer with cerebral palsy and allowed cases involving tenants without heat or hot water to drag on   sources told The Post . The Manhattan Housing Court ’ s advisory council   which reviews its judges after each four - year term   recently ruled that jurist Susan Avery should get the boot — as it catalogued years of complaints against her   sources said . Avery ’ s chief - judge boss is now set to follow through on the recommendation by the end of the year   sources said . “ Considering the complaints against her   it ’ s about time for her to leave the bench  ” said Alan Flacks   a longtime local resident pushing for judicial reform . Avery   52   of East 84th Street   landed her $ 175   000 - a - year job in 2012 thanks to a political appointment by then - Chief Judge Gail Prudenti . But she started demonstrating poor judgment almost immediately from the bench   according to the 14 - member Advisory Council for the Housing Part of the Civil Court of New York City . In 2013   Avery reprimanded a lawyer with cerebral palsy for his sloppy handwriting   the panel said in its four - page finding   which called the judge “ unfeeling .’’ The incident resulted in a letter of caution being placed in Avery ’ s file   according to a court source . The council — comprised of representatives from both the real - estate industry and tenants ’ organizations appointed by the mayor and governor — also criticized Avery for “ excessive multi - week adjournments ” for cases involving lack of heat and hot water   said the letter   a copy of which was read to The Post . The advisory council said in its decision last month that the New York Law School grad showed a general “ lack of concern ” for the litigants before her . The council added it was “ disturbed further ” by conflicts of interests involving the Housing Court judge ’ s family real - estate holdings . A court source said  Avery  failed to disclose that a law firm administering a family trust also regularly represents landlords in cases before the judge . Meanwhile   the jurist garnered a “ not approved ” rating by the city Bar Association — twice . Voters also refused to back her two bids to move up to civil court . In the summer of 2016    a judge who was running against Avery for a civil - court position  lodged a complaint over her campaign tactics . Justice Sabrina Kraus   who was appointed to the bench in 2005   accused Avery ’ s boyfriend of making derogatory comments about her Iranian heritage on Facebook .  Avery  failed to disavow the remarks   showing ethnic bias   the advisory panel added . Kraus beat  Avery  to win the seat .  Avery  ran for civil court again this year but lost in the September primary .  Avery  did not respond to multiple requests for comment . The former chief judge who appointed her   Prudenti   said she had no memory of choosing her .

Who:  Cara  and Jesse Nuno
How much: $272 261 in five years 
Cara  and  Jesse Nuno  (Photo: NerdWallet.com)
Six years ago   Cara  and  Jesse Nuno  could not imagine a debt-free life.
 Cara : I think I had suggested [going to a credit counselor] in the past  but at the time Jess was too proud to talk to  them .
Jesse: In 2012  I can’t remember if we saw the advertisement [for the agency] on TV or not  but somehow it just kinda clicked  so we went to  them .  They  gave us April’s number.
April (credit counselor): The majority of  their  debt was old and in collections  so they were really at the “cleanup stage” and [handling each debt] one at a time more than all together. They used a mix of different techniques to address the collections. Some needed to be disputed as already paid or invalid. They also had some that appeared to be past the statute of limitations  so they first needed to verify this with an attorney and then dispute. Others they settled on  but most they made paid in full.
 Cara :  We  kept looking each month at what  we  had and the progress  we  had made. Slowly but surely  as  we  disputed and paid down  our  debts   our  credit scores went up.
 Jesse : Same for me. I was looking forward to the future where one day   we ’d be able to buy things again.
April: When  Jesse  and Cara first came to me in 2012  their credit scores were 536 and 584  respectively. As of 2016  Cara’s was 667 and  Jesse ’s was 758.
 Jesse : I seem to be sleeping better at night  not tossing and turning like I used to  figuring how I’m going to pay this or how I’m going to pay that. It takes its toll — I got the gray hair to prove it.
 Cara :  We ’d like to do some work on the house and get  our  vehicles paid off. Now  we  have a budget  and Jess pays all  our  bills early.
 Cara : It’s OK to ask for counseling to get started with a plan to get your debt paid off. Don’t be embarrassed to ask for help because you’re not the only person that’s been there.

 McHugh could not be reached for comment. His attorney  Greg Stannard  said he had not had time to review the case and could not comment.
 McHugh is under a court order to sell all his rental properties in Los Angeles by the fall of 2010 as part of a plea agreement to avoid jail time for fire and habitability violations.
 City officials have been trying to regulate McHugh for decades. In the 1980s  then-City Attorney Ira Reiner accused McHugh  now 84  of dealing in ""blood money"" and threatened to put him in jail.
 But the landlord continued to amass buildings and a record of violating health and safety codes. Last summer  his lawyer told city officials that he owned more than 140 properties  housing about 8 000 people  many of them impoverished immigrants in the city's core.
 Tenants and their advocates say the conditions in his buildings caused health risks such as lead poisoning  asthma and ear infections caused by allergy to cockroaches.

 Judge Roy Moore  speaks as  he  participates in the Mid-Alabama Republican Club's Veterans Day Program in Vestavia Hills  Alabama  U.S.  November 11  2017. REUTERS/Marvin Gentry
Trump’s position did not go as far as other Republican leaders in Washington who have said they believe the women accusing the former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice and have demanded  Moore  withdraw from the race before the Dec. 12 vote.
“The president said in his statement earlier this week that if the allegations are true  then  Roy Moore  should step aside. He still firmly believes that ” she said.
Asked if the president’s endorsement of  Moore  still stands  Sanders said Trump thinks Alabama voters should decide the winner of the race.
In the past week  multiple women have accused  Moore  of sexual improprieties or unwanted romantic advances they said occurred decades ago. Some of the women were teenagers at the time  and he was in his 30s.
Before the allegations surfaced   Moore  was heavily favored to defeat Democrat Doug Jones in the special election next month.
 Moore  scored a decisive Republican primary victory in September over Luther Strange  who was appointed to fill the vacant seat after Jeff Sessions became U.S. attorney general earlier this year.
Trump backed Strange in the primary but threw his support to  Moore  after Strange’s defeat.

input: Face masks are placed on children in Antananarivo   Madagascar   on Tuesday . ( Alexander Joe / Associated Press ) Some might consider the plague a thing of the past   buried deep in medieval history . But it thrives in Madagascar   where the disease is a seasonal worry . And this year   the country is experiencing what may be its deadliest outbreak in years : About 194 people are suspected to have fallen ill from the plague since August   and 33 have died as of Saturday   according to Madagascar ’ s Ministry of Health . Experts say they can ’ t remember the last time the death toll was so high . In 2016   63 people died over the course of the year   out of 275 cases . The majority of this year ’ s cases are pneumonic plague   which can be transmitted through coughing   according to the BBC . This form of the disease can kill an infected person in less than a day . To slow the outbreak   Madagascar is temporarily shutting down its public institutions . Government authorities ordered two universities to close   and other schools have shut their doors across the country   including the capital   Antananarivo   so buildings can be sprayed with insecticides . The World Health Organization has shipped more than a million doses of antibiotics to the country   the BBC reported . “ We are scared — all of these deaths show that the situation is serious  ” Miora Herinjatovo   55   told Agence France - Presse on Wednesday . She got a mask from a hospital — unlike her husband   who failed to get one after standing in line outside a pharmacy . He instead collected a handful of generic antibiotics . [ The plague   alive and well in Madagascar ] Experts say the outbreak started in late August   when a 31 - year - old man from the eastern city of Toamasina took a trip inland to Ankazobe   where the plague lives in rodent and flea populations . While there   he came down with malaria - like symptoms . He died in a taxi home   passing through Antananarivo   the WHO said in a Sept . 28 statement . The WHO said that many of the cases identified are directly or indirectly linked to the man   which is evidence of person - to - person transmission . Of the 31 people who made direct or indirect contact with him   four became ill and died   the WHO said . Antananarivo and Toamasina were among the most - infected cities : As of Sept . 30   Antananarivo and its suburbs had 27 cases and seven deaths   and Toamasina had 18 cases and five deaths . Antananarivo has about 1 . 3 million residents   while Toamasina has about 237   000   according to a 2014 count by the National Institute of Statistics in Madagascar . Public gatherings   including jazz festivals and basketball tournaments   have been called off to prevent the plague from spreading   according to media reports . One of the people killed by the plague last week was a basketball coach from the Seychelles   who died while visiting the capital for a tournament   according to a WHO report released Thursday . “ Right now   we have the outbreak of a very infectious   fatal disease  ” said Katharina Kreppel   an epidemiologist at the Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania   who spent four years conducting field research in Madagascar . “ If people don ’ t notice fast enough   or don ’ t have access to health care fast enough   they die very quickly .” [ There ’ s plague in Arizona . Authorities warn of fleas that can infect people and pets .] This plague shares the same bacterium   yersinia pestis   that caused the “ Black Death ” pandemic in Europe during the 14th century . The most common form of the plague in Madagascar was   until this year   the bubonic plague   spread to humans through infected fleas that contracted the infection from small animals they bit   like rats . The disease is typically spread to humans by the bite of an infected flea   according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The bubonic plague is often treatable with antibiotics . If left untreated   though   the bacteria can spread through the bloodstream to the lungs and cause pneumonic plague — a deadly   more infectious form that ’ s now spreading throughout Madagascar . Symptoms of the pneumonic plague are similar to the common cold   according to the CDC . The symptoms of bubonic plague are fever   headaches   chills and weakness — as well as one or more swollen and painful lymph nodes   known as buboes . The bacteria multiply in the lymph node closest to where the bacteria entered the body   usually through the infected flea bite   according to the CDC . If an infected person isn ’ t given antibiotics   the bacteria can spread to other parts of the body . Should the bubonic plague become pneumonic   the person will develop shortness of breath   chest pain and sometimes bloody or watery mucous . The pneumonia may cause respiratory failure and shock . All forms of plague   if untreated   can progress rapidly to death   according to the CDC . There have been three major plague pandemics : The Justinian plague   which broke in the Byzantine Empire in AD 541 ; the “ Black Death  ” which originated in China in 1334 and spread to Europe ; and the Modern Plague   which began in China in the 1860s and appeared in Hong Kong by 1894   according to the CDC . It was during the last pandemic that scientists identified the link between the bacteria and infectious flea bites   and rat - associated plague was soon brought under control in most urban areas . The plague has since been controlled in most countries with insecticides   according to the CDC . And since it can be treated with antibiotics   the spread of the disease is usually prevented if promptly identified . The plague is most commonly found in sub - Saharan Africa and Madagascar   areas which account for more than 95 percent of reported cases   according to the CDC . Madagascar often sees the highest numbers of bubonic plague cases worldwide   about 600 infections annually . Madagascar has been in the throes of a political crisis since 2009 and has become one of the poorest countries in the world   with more than 92 percent of the population living on less than $ 2 a day   according to the World Bank Group . It ’ s lost a substantial portion of international aid   and its infrastructure has deteriorated . Once rice harvest season finishes at the end of summer   the rat population drops   as they don ’ t have as much food . Fleas begin looking for new hosts to bite and settle on humans . As it is an island   Madagascar is home to species that transmit the plague and often aren ’ t found anywhere else    Kreppel  told The Washington Post . While Madagascar ’ s scientists have monitored plague patterns for years and have the knowledge to mitigate the spread of this new   pneumonic plague   the money and resources to do so aren ’ t available    Kreppel  said . There isn ’ t adequate funding for insecticides   spraying equipment or antibiotics   she said   and there aren ’ t enough health facilities to house quarantined patients . The country can ’ t afford the vehicles required to travel to isolated villages   should the disease spread further    Kreppel  said . “ If an outbreak like this happened in the U . S . or Europe or anywhere else it would be controlled quite fast   because the resources are there  ” she said . This post has been updated .

Now complete the following example-
input: But  President Donald J. Trump  hardly looked like a grand wizard a week ago today. On January 8   he  hosted Alveda King  the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; Isaac Newton Farris Jr.  Dr. King’s nephew  and Bruce Levell of the National Diversity Coalition for  Trump . All three of  Trump ’s guests are black.
“I did about 200 cataract surgeries with a group of surgeons in Haiti and the same in Central America ” Senator Paul  an ophthalmologist  said on NBC’s Meet the Press yesterday. “And when we asked  Donald J. Trump  as a private citizen to support those trips   he  was a large financial backer of both medical mission trips.” Paul continued: “I think it’s unfair then to sort of all of a sudden paint him  ‘Oh well   he ’s a racist ’ when I know  for a fact  that  he  cares very deeply about the people in Haiti because  he  helped finance a trip where we were able to get vision back for 200 people in Haiti.”
Whatever  Trump  said or didn’t say  the reaction has been beyond incendiary  with the words “racist” and “racism” erupting like volcanos around the Pacific Ring of Fire.
 Trump’s  alleged language  if uttered  was unfortunate  vulgar  and unpresidential  although  he  hardly would have been the first chief executive to use profanity in office.  His  supposed words apparently were aimed at sh**hole nations  rather than sh**hole people. The latter would have been inexcusable.
It is widely understood that certain nations are garden spots  and others are not. It is fair to say that Haiti  El Salvador  and a tragically high number of African countries are non-garden spots. It also is perfectly appropriate to ask whether America would be better off with immigrants from such impoverished and embattled places or from prosperous nations  such as Norway  which  Trump  reportedly mentioned. It likely was top of mind  given Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg’s visit and joint press conference with him on Wednesday.
Whatever he stated or didn’t   President Trump  should learn these lessons from this experience  and repeat them to  himself  daily:
“Every word I say matters.” This is true in public  in private  and around the clock  until  he  leaves the White House and begins work on the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library.
 Trump  should think of  himself  as Jim Carrey in the 1998 film The Truman Show. Except when  he  is in bed   Trump  should behave as if every breath  he  takes were being broadcast live around the globe.
 Trump  needs to remember that Democrats are not  his  pals. They almost universally crave  his  failure  resist  his  program  and want to yank  him  from office — never mind the 304 votes  he  legitimately won in the Electoral College. Anything  he  says in front of Democrats (and even some Never  Trump  Republicans  alas) can and will be used against  him  in the court of public opinion.  Senator Durbin  should be condemned for publicizing (or distorting)  his  private conversation with  Trump   thus sabotaging efforts to reach a DACA deal. But this should be no more shocking than if  somewhere in Illinois  a rooster crowed at dawn.
 Trump  needs to remember that Democrats are not  his  pals.
Ned Ryun of American Majority has an excellent idea: Whenever  President Trump  meets with Democrats   he  should summon news cameras and let them stay until Democrats leave. Trump displayed his leadership skills to almost universal applause when he allowed the media to broadcast live for 55 minutes from the Cabinet Room  as he negotiated immigration and border security last Tuesday. Doing this regularly when Democrats are around will prevent them from offering journalists an alternative version of events. With cameras present  Trump should be on his best behavior. And the American people will benefit from Senate-floor-like transparency inside the White House. This would be unprecedented and gain Trump considerable respect for opening a virtual sunroof atop the West Wing.
Trump’s job is to recall at all times  with the relentlessness of a bloodhound chasing an escaped Death Row inmate  that he must not give free knives and anvils to people who hate his guts and literally would cheer if he woke up dead tomorrow morning . (And the Left need not bother to deny this. Everyone knows this is true  as evidenced by the Left’s repeated fantasies about Trump being shot  stabbed  and decapitated.) These people would call  Trump  a racist for ordering vanilla ice cream.  He  should remember this without fail and act accordingly.
If  Trump  becomes blurry about this fact   he  should remember the very first fake-news story to emerge on  his  watch. On January 20  during  his  very first day as president  Time magazine’s Zeke Miller reported that Trump removed a bust of Dr. Martin Luther King from the Oval Office. This confirmed that  Trump  was a racist who couldn’t wait to evict that troublemaking black from  his  new office.

BuzzFeed News reported that the driver had alleged  Winston  grabbed her crotch during a ride in Scottsdale  Arizona in March 2016.  Winston  has denied the allegation.
 Winston  is now being probed by the NFLâs special counsel for investigations  Lisa Friel  who had written to the quarterbackâs accuser.
âThe League has been informed that you may have been the victim of such a violation perpetrated by Tampa Bay Buccaneers player Jameis Winston â Friel wrote in the letter.
 Winston   23  issued a statement in response to the BuzzFeed report  denying the allegations.
âA news organization has published a story about me regarding an alleged incident involving a female Uber driver from approximately two years ago â  Winston  said.
 Winston  is in  his  third season with Tampa Bay after being the top pick in the 2015 draft.
 His  college career had been dogged by controversy  including a 2012 allegation of rape by a fellow student at Florida State.  Winston  did not face charges following the incident.

input: OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo  speaks to the media during  his  visit in Abuja  Nigeria Febuary 27  2017. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - OPECâs Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo on Tuesday called on U.S. shale oil producers to help curtail global oil supply  warning extraordinary measures might be needed next year to sustain the rebalanced market in the medium to long term.
âWe urge our friends  in the shale basins of North America to take this shared responsibility with all seriousness it deserves  as one of the key lessons learnt from the current unique supply-driven cycle â said  Barkindo .
âAt the moment we (OPEC and independent U.S. producers) both agreed that we have a shared responsibility in maintaining stability because they are also not insulated from the impact of this downturn â  Barkindo  said  referring to a slide in oil prices that spurred OPEC to agree production cuts late last year.
While OPEC and some other producers  including Russia have cut supplies this year in order to prop up prices  U.S. production has soared by almost 10 percent this year  driven largely by shale drillers.  Barkindo  said  he  hoped that new producers  not just U.S. shale drillers  would join production cuts.
âDemand-supply is returning to rebalance through massive destocking that we have been witnessing of stocks in OECD across regions in a very massive way â  Barkindo  said later  speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the conference.
âIn the past four months alone  we have seen destocking to the tune of 130 million bpd â  he  said.
The aim of the OPEC-led cut is to trim the level of oil in OECD industrialized countries compared with the five-year supply average.  Barkindo  said the stock overhang to the five-year average stood at 171 million barrels in August  against 338 million at the start of the year.
âThe speed and pace (of destocking) has accelerated as a result of anticipated and projected demand growth in the second half of 2017 to the tune of 2 million bpd. We are witnessing a fast return to a balanced market â  Barkindo  said.
Still  on  Sunday Barkindo  said OPEC and other oil producers might need to take âsome extraordinary measuresâ next year to rebalance the oil market.
World oil demand growth in 2017 is expected at 1.45 million barrels per day (BPD) and it should stay around 1.4 million bpd in 2018   Barkindo  said.  He  said Indiaâs share of global oil demand is expected to rise to over 9 percent by 2040  up from 4 percent now.

Now complete the following example-
input: But Gaga has spent the past three years deconstructing her previous project  which is its own kind of performance. Elaborate dance pop ceded ground to jazz standards  showtunes  and country rock. Tentacle gowns went into the closet; jeans and a pink cowboy hat came out. The director Chris Moukarbel shot Five Foot Two largely on handheld—maybe even smartphone—cameras. You see Gaga cooking  recording  planning  crying  bonding. In one scene  she’s topless as she chats with her team by the poolside. The implication: This is Gaga  au naturel. Yet she never seems to forget the camera. Five Foot Two documents last year’s release of her album Joanne  and makes clear how much Gaga’s public reboot relied on demonstrating that she  like everyone else  suffers. Gaga has increasingly mined the traumas of her own life  with songs and philanthropic efforts growing out of her rape at age 19. The dissolution of her engagement to the actor Taylor Kinney  mournfully referenced a few times in the documentary  seemed to inform the breakup-themed Joanne singles “Perfect Illusion” and “Million Reasons.” But there was a deeper source of anguish on  Joanne   too. The album is named for  her  aunt  an aspiring artist who died of lupus at age 19 in 1974. “Seeing what that did to [my father] and my family was the most powerful thing I experienced growing up ” Gaga tells the journalist Darryl Pinckney in the film. “I am Joanne. I am my father’s daughter. That is what this record is about.”
The most memorable scene of the documentary comes when she first plays the album’s delicate  acoustic title track for her grandmother   Joanne’s  mom. The moment verges on uncomfortable  and not only because Gaga’s father   Joanne’s  brother  gets up and leaves the room in apparent distress midway through. Gaga herself seems hungry to have her telling of an ordeal she did not personally experience validated by those who did. “Did I get it right?” she asks her grandmother  mid-hug. “Yes you did ” her grandmother responds. But she has a warning for Gaga  too: “Don’t become maudlin over all this.” For now  Gaga is asking not for applause but understanding. It’s never explicitly stated  but Gaga seems to connect to  Joanne ’s story in part because of  her  own medical situation. Iconography about hospitals and crutches and wheelchairs over the years hinted that the seemingly bionic pop star faced problems of the flesh off-stage. In 2010   she  told Larry King  she  tested “borderline positive” for lupus.  She ’s still feeling the effects of the injury  she  sustained in 2013  as seen in a Five Foot Two moment when  she  pauses rehearsals for  her  Super Bowl halftime show because of hip tightness.  Fibromyalgia  appears to make that problem worse  and being a pop star in chronic pain certainly doesn’t seem easy. One scene shows  her  having  her  makeup done for a performance while sitting in a doctor’s examination room.
Gaga’s particular ailment is an almost-literal rendering of Jamison’s “pain without a cause”—which is  as  she  notes  “pain which can’t be trusted.” A poorly understood but widespread disorder that seems to inordinately affect women  fibromyalgia is sometimes assumed to be psychosomatic. “Drug Approved. Is Disease Real?” read a 2008 New York Times headline about the first FDA-sanctioned drug to treat it. Gaga has said that she wants to help raise awareness and research dollars. During one excruciating flare-up shown in Five Foot Two  she sympathizes with less-privileged sufferers of the disorder: “Like  I don’t know what I’d fuckin’ do if I didn’t have everybody here to help me.” A few moments later  she’s looking straight into the camera. “Do I look pathetic?” she asks  tear-streaked  lying on a couch  a therapist massaging her. “I’m so embarrassed.” It’s a powerful moment because the stigma of pain is clearly part of the pain itself. But it’s also aesthetically striking. To answer Gaga’s question  she actually looks like she did in parts of the “Bad Romance” video—crying  stripped down  and oddly luminous. It’s a sign of fame’s power on the viewer: Whatever lengths she might go to put person over persona  the persona remains. * * * Pop music has firmly moved on from the phase of gleeful  Technicolor artifice that Gaga stood for at her peak. Contemporaries in wildness like Kesha and Miley Cyrus have done much what Gaga has done and traded Alexander McQueen creations for cowboy boots. They have also made a diaristic turn  harmonizing their music with their angsty  tabloid sagas.
Usually this means trading on the spectacle of suffering to sell pop’s ultimate commodity—inspiration. Beyoncé’s Lemonade is the signal example  taking the sting of infidelity to spin a tale of hurt and overcoming. Kesha’s alleged abuse by her mentor and producer Dr. Luke was addressed and transcended on this year’s Rainbow. Katy Perry marketed her latest album with an on-camera therapy session in which she cried about her “real” self wanting to be known. Taylor Swift seems on the verge of unveiling a more acidic survival story. “Victim to victory” songs are always in fashion  but the latest boom relies  more than pop usually does  on the feeling of authenticity. Adult listeners of drive-time radio typically know they’re in the realm of fantasy and commerce  yet fully enjoying the confessional-pop performance means buying into the non-musical narratives surrounding them. Beyoncé rolled her own child and husband into the Lemonade visual experience. “I write this shit  baby ” Kesha insisted on a recent single. You’re explicitly asked to believe that the gap between performer and person is negligible.  Joanne  already fit into this triumphant-confessional class  with Gaga singing about family members and friends by name and roaring  “I might not be flawless but you know I’ve got a diamond heart.” The meta-text  all along  was Gaga’s own career arc—a sense that  she ’d come down from the heights  she ’d reached from 2008 to 2013  stumbled with  her  third album  and might never recover. Glimmers of past traumas and family tragedy contributed to the pathos.  Her  medical troubles would seem to retroactively add in a new layer  though it’s unclear when  she  received  her  fibromyalgia diagnosis  and little on the album can be heard as an explicit reference to illness. Certainly the lyrics about healing through love on  her  post- Joanne  single  “The Cure ” now seem a lot less generic.

input: If  Corey   Crawford âs âupper-bodyâ injury keeps  him  out the rest of the season  which was a possibility indicated by Sportsnetâs Elliotte Friedman  then the Blackhawks will have a âlower-standingsâ issue.
When  Crawford  was placed on the injured list on Dec. 27  the Hawks were two points behind the Wild for the second wild-card spot  but held two games in hand.
Without  Crawford   the Hawks have gone 5-4-1 and find themselves three points behind the eighth-seeded Kings  who also have a game in hand.
To recap  their lot without  Crawford  has become worse  and it could get a lot worse if  he  continues to suffer from vertigo again as reported by the Chicago Sun-Times.
 Crawford  has been the Hawksâ best player this season  and itâs not even close.  He  won a lot of games by  himself  when  his  teammates proved inept or inert.  His  play had been Vezina Trophy-worthy  and even now  his  .929 save percentage ranks third in the league while  his  2.27 goals-against average stands fifth overall.
It seems impossible to imagine the Hawks trading for  another Crawford  and they donât have an extra one handy. Jeff Glass has a better backstory than a future as a playoff goalie from what Iâve seen. Anton Forsberg seems earnest and talented  but his goals-against average is more than a half-goal worse than Crawfordâs  which is a bad thing for a once-dominant team that sadly sometimes canât score even a half-goal a game. See Sundayâs shutout-loss-tank-job against the dreaded Red Wings at home on Sunday.
The long-range view goes only to Feb. 26. Thatâs the trade deadline. The Hawks will play 18 games before then and have a little more than five weeks to get some good news on  Crawford .

input: In 2016   Lemonis  partnered with Parlour Enterprises  which operated the California Farrell's locations  to revive the brand in exchange for a 51 percent stake in the Farrell's trademark.
 Lemonis  entrusted Parlour Enterprise CFO Paul Kramer and  its  since-resigned CEO Mike Fleming with the task of revamping the restaurant.
Instead  Kramer and Fleming neglected the changes  Lemonis  had requested. The most successful Farrell's location  which once brought in over $4 million in sales  closed down because the owners' were behind on rent.
""I got basically a big F.U. and I have to decide whether I just want to cut my losses and move on because I don't want to throw good money after a bad situation ""  Lemonis  said.
When  Lemonis  investigated further into Farrell's demise   he  spoke with Lee  who had been working as a regional manager at the restaurant for nearly six years and was in charge of updating the restaurant's menu in 2016.
Lee admitted he wasn't able to do his job properly because of Kramer's resistance to change. After negotiating a new lease for Farrell's most successful location   Lemonis  agreed to help save the restaurant in exchange for a 75 percent stake in the company.
Unlike Fleming and Kramer  Lee did his best to help keep Farrell's afloat. ""For Travis  it's always about the customer  it's always about the employee  it's always about the company  "" Lemonis  said. ""It's never about him.""
That's why  Lemonis  went the extra step to acknowledge Lee's dedication to Farrell's.
""Thank yous are necessary but  let's be honest  they're not everything. So I want to give you a bonus  "" Lemonis  said. ""[This could] never have worked without you.""
The bonus not only showed  Lemonis'  gratitude for the extra effort Lee put into the business  it's also a tactic that could boost Lee's morale and productivity.
Lee  meanwhile  expressed his appreciation for  Lemonis'  leadership move and said the money would help his family.
Under Lee's new changes  the new Farrell's location is expected to make $4.2 million in revenue â which prompted  Lemonis  to called  him  a ""rockstar.""
""You have not only earned my trust but you have earned my respect ""  Lemonis  told Lee. ""You don't work for Farrell's  you're my partner at Farrell's.""
""You're not an employee. This is your business ""  he  added. ""Don't you ever forget that this is your business.""

The letter â which complains that the $95 million being spent on a new police academy would be better spent on schools â echoes comments directed at  Emanuel  by handfuls of hecklers at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor on Jan. 19  and at the University of California  Los Angeles  on Feb. 12.
In Los Angeles last week   Emanuel  laughed off the protests  telling  his  audience that  he  âdidnât realize there were that many direct flightsâ from Chicago. In Ann Arbor   Emanuel  attempted to engage the protesters  who continued to chant at  him . Some in the audience booed the hecklers.
But the Harvard protesters accuse  Emanuel  of doing too little to halt the decline in the size of Chicagoâs black population and write that  âAs future and current designers  urban planners  policy-makers  organizers and educators  we cannot disregard the people who are in danger because of Rahm Emanuelâs administration.â

Now complete the following example-
input: By any measure , the Mitt Romney for president campaign has had a painfully bad week . 
That day , Romney addressed the NAACP convention in Houston . 
The speech was poorly received , so much so that Romney , in an interview that afternoon on Fox Business , told host Neil Cavuto that he had ""expected"" boos . 
Some interpreted that comment as proof that Romney had actually wanted to be booed by the NAACP in order to rev up elements of the conservative base . 
The Romney campaign next reacted by whispering to the Drudge Report -LRB- which acts as a kind of message board for Romney -RRB- that it was seriously considering Condoleezza Rice as a running mate . 
Gillespie : Romney retroactively retired . 
Gillespie : Romney retroactively retired 02:44 . 
And it was that ""win the hour"" mentality that got the Romney campaign into much more serious trouble when the Obama campaign launched a big push on Romney 's business record the next day . 
Gergen : Obama 's charges vs. Romney do n't hold up . 
Thursday morning , the Obama campaign released a tough ad attacking the record of downsizing and outsourcing at Romney 's old firm , Bain Capital . 
The Romney campaign reacted with outrage . 
In support of the ad , Romney 's team argued that he had left Bain Capital in February 1999 ; the incidents alluded to by the Obama campaign all occurred after that date and had nothing to do with Romney . 
The first attack on Romney had been a jab , dropping Romney 's guard against the haymaker : On Friday , the Obama team counter-charged that it was Romney who was lying in his ads or who had committed a felony , lying on 140 official forms that he signed as CEO and sole shareholder of Bain between 1999 and 2002 . 
Romney now chased the Obama story , granting five TV interviews to reiterate his version of events . 
By Sunday , even Romney supporters were urging the thing he wants least : release of more income tax returns . 
And here again , what got Romney into the trouble was his war room . 
It was the too-fierce response to Attack 1 -- the adamant insistence that Romney had nothing , nothing to do with anything that happened at Bain after February 1999 -- that set up Romney for Attack 2 : Did he lie on SEC forms ? 
Yes , it is technically true that Romney ended his operational role at Bain before he ended his titular role . 
Romney 's core problem is this : He heads a party that must win two-thirds of the white working-class vote in presidential elections to compensate for its weakness in almost every demographic category . 
The white working class is the most pessimistic and alienated group in the electorate , and it especially fears and dislikes the kind of financial methods that gained Romney his fortune . 
Romney has a strong potential defense : Bain was in the business of making companies more efficient and profitable . 
However , it 's not an argument that appeals much to the voters Romney most intensely needs to win . 
And this time , by trying to do too much , the Romney war room may have blasted its own side with lethal friendly fire .

And it sounds like  he  wants options.
""I see my role as CEO to prepare as many people as I can to be CEO  and that's what I'm doing. And then the board makes a decision at that point in time ""  Cook  said in an interview with BuzzFeed News.
 Cook  gave the interview at Apple's new Chicago retail store  a flagship for the company as it looks to turn its locations into must-see attractions.
Apple's head of retail  Angela  Ahrendts  flanked Tim Cook during the interview . It's not surprising  she  was there  but it is notable for  Cook  to discuss succession next to  her .

Now complete the following example-
input: Pittsburgh Steelers offensive tackle Alejandro Villanueva is a former Army Ranger. While his team remained off the field for the national anthem  he stood by the tunnel with his hand over his heart. As the weekend descended into madness from the liberal media over President Trumpâs remarks about NFL players who take a knee during the Star-Spangled Banner  Villanueva proved to be Sundayâs hero.  Yet  Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin  who defended his team âs actions to remain off the field as avoiding playing politics  was disappointed the former Army Ranger visibly stood for the anthem.
âLike I said  I was looking for 100 percent participation  we were gonna be respectful of our football team â said  Tomlin . Guy torched  him :
Let me see if I've got this straight:  Tomlin  -- a Clinton donor and fundraiser -- is upset that Villanueva was not ""respectful of our football team"" because he decided to honor the country for which he's courageously risked his life by not snubbing the national anthem? This is the display of 'disunity' that bothers Tomlin?
Now  Fox Sports 1âs Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe joined  Tomlin   noting that Villanueva should have remained out of sight (via Mediaite) [emphasis mine]:
âIt didnât work for him to step out of the tunnel â Bayless said during Mondayâs edition of Undisputed. âIf  in fact  you had all agreed  you had voted whether a majority or unanimously  to do this as a team to stay up in the tunnel until the Anthem was done. And  Mike Tomlin  was clear.â Baylessâs colleague  Shannon Sharpe  agreed. âTeams  they always take the military mentality  because itâs all for one  one for all. Whatever we decide to do thatâs what weâre going to do.  He  went on  his  own. I get it.  He  was in the military. I commend  him  for  his  service. But in this situation if the team decided that we  all of us  were going to wait in the tunnel while the national anthem is being played  that was the protocol that should have been followed.â
The thing is no one in that universe gets it. No one. We can talk about free speech all day; the point is that 72 percent of Americans view Colin Kaepernick  who started this whole controversy in San Francisco  and  his  national anthem antics as unpatriotic. Thereâs a massive disconnect between the fans and the league. Americans are proud. They respect those who serve and when people take a knee  they see spit flying in the faces of those who have sacrificed to protect our freedoms here at home. Thereâs no changing that. If you have to explain  youâre losing. Sometimes itâs just wrong. And huddling in the tunnel like the Brits during the Blitz because no one could agree on something as simple as respecting and standing for the national anthem is just absurd. Maybe thatâs why Villanueva merchandise is going through the roof. For the bubble  this stunt didnât work  for everyone elseâthere was an American hero honoring our country. No one should be fired or suspended for taking a knee of course. They do deserve a kick in the teeth on social media  which was expected  and they shouldnât expect the intensity to subside.

2. Critics of  Trump ’s decision to end CSR payments seem to forget a federal judge called them unconstitutional and ordered that they stop. — Michael F. Cannon (@mfcannon) October 13  2017
--But the  Trump  administration is injecting turbulence into the Obamacare marketplaces by cutting off the payments just as insurers are finalizing their 2018 plan offerings. Losing the approximately $7 billion in annual payments  which reimburse insurers for discounting deductibles and co-payments for the lowest-income enrollees  is grounds for insurers to back out of their federal contracts to even sell plans next year. The administration had been making the payments on a month-to-month basis  prompting complaints by insurers about a lack of certainty as they tried to plan ahead.

 TRUMP TEMPERATURE
--Yesterday  President Trump  signed an anticipated executive order intended to circumvent certain ACA rules by making it easier for individuals and small business to buy alternative types of health insurance with lower prices but fewer benefits  The Post's Amy Goldstein reports.
""The White House and allies portray  the president’s  move as wielding administrative powers to accomplish what congressional Republicans have failed to achieve: fostering more coverage choices while tearing down the law’s insurance marketplaces "" Amy writes. ""The order represents  Trump ’s biggest step to date to reverse the health-care policies of the Obama administration  a central promise since last year’s presidential campaign.
""Critics  who include state insurance commissioners  most of the health-insurance industry and mainstream policy specialists  predict that a proliferation of these other kinds of coverage will have damaging ripple effects: driving up costs for consumers with serious medical conditions and prompting more insurers to flee the law’s marketplaces. Part of  Trump ’s action  they say  will spark court challenges over  its  legality.""
--It expands the availability of short-term insurance policies  which offer limited benefits as a bridge for people between jobs or young adults no longer eligible for their parents’ health plans. The Obama administration ruled that short-term insurance may not last for more than three months;  Trump  wants to extend that to nearly a year.
Of course   Trump  insisted yesterday that  he  was providing ""Obamacare relief"" in remarks shortly before signing the order. ""This will cost the United States government virtually nothing and people will have great  great  healthcare ""  he  said. ""And when i say people  I mean by the millions and millions.""

(Bill Gorman / AP) (Bill Gorman / AP)
A U.S. military official said that a military hostage team had flown to Pakistan Wednesday  prepared to fly the family out. The team did a preliminary health assessment of the family and had a transport plane ready to go. But sometime after daybreak there  as the family members were walking to the plane   Boyle  said  he  did not want to board.
Another U.S. official said  Boyle  was nervous about being in ""custody"" given  his  background.
 Boyle  was once married to Zaynab Khadr  the older sister of former Guantanamo Bay detainee Omar Khadr and the daughter of a late senior al-Qaida financier. Her father  Ahmed Said Khadr  and the family stayed with Osama bin Laden briefly when Omar Khadr was a boy.
Officials had discounted any link between that background and  Boyle 's capture  with one official describing it in 2014 as a ""horrible coincidence.""
The Toronto Star reported that  Boyle  spoke to  his  parents after  his  release. "" Josh  said  he  was doing pretty well for someone who has spent the last five years in an underground prison ""  his  father told the paper.
The release came together rapidly Wednesday. It happened nearly five years to the day after Coleman and  Boyle  lost touch with their families while traveling in a mountainous region near the Afghan capital of Kabul.
The couple set off in the summer 2012 for a journey that took them to Russia  the central Asian countries of Kazakhstan  Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan  and then to Afghanistan. Coleman's parents last heard from their son-in-law on Oct. 8  2012  from an internet cafe in what  Boyle  described as an ""unsafe"" part of Afghanistan.
 Boyle 's parents say their son told them in a letter that he and his wife tried to protect the children by pretending their signs of captivity were part of a game being played with guards.

Referring to strikes in which terrorists have attacked people using knives or vehicles   Duke  said ""Creating terror is their goal.""
 Duke  warned it was taking less time for terrorists to plan attacks as they could exploit ""safe spaces online"" to evade detection  the outlet noted.

Upset about damaging leaks of  his  calls with world leaders and other national security information   Trump  has ordered an internal investigation to find the leakers. Staffers  meanwhile  are so fearful of being accused of talking to the media that some have resorted to a secret chat app — Confide — that erases messages as soon as they’re read.
The chaos and competing factions that were a  Trump  trademark in business and campaigning now are starting to define his presidency  according to interviews with a dozen White House officials as well as other Republicans. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss internal White House dynamics and deliberations.
Staffers buzz privately about who is up and who is down  with many eagerly gossiping about which poor colleague gets an unflattering portrayal on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live.” For the past two weeks  it has been White House press secretary Sean Spicer. But aides said  Trump  was especially upset by a sketch that cast White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon as the Grim Reaper manipulating the president — who was ultimately relegated to a miniature desk  playing dolefully with an expandable toy.
[ Trump  turns Mar-a-Lago Club dinner table into an open-air situation room]
On Monday afternoon  as speculation of a staff shake-up was rife on cable news channels   Trump  made clear to a small group of reporters what  he  thought of  his  chief of staff: “Reince is doing a great job. Not a good job. A great job ” the president said.
The problem:  Trump  had yet to weigh in  and aides and advisers were loath to take sides without knowing for certain whether their often mercurial and erratic boss wanted to keep Flynn or cut him loose.
On Monday  after  Trump  made it through a joint news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau without being asked about Flynn  a group of reporters gathered outside Spicer’s office for more than 80 minutes. Spicer twice declined to answer questions about Flynn. When White House chief of staff Reince Priebus walked by  he was asked whether the president still had confidence in Flynn. Priebus gave no answer.
Not long after  Kellyanne Conway  the counselor to the president  said  Trump  had “full confidence” in Flynn. Yet a few minutes later  Spicer issued an official — and conflicting — statement  saying  Trump  was “evaluating the situation.”

Christopher Ruddy  a longtime friend of  Trump ’s who on Sunday publicly criticized Priebus in television and print interviews as being “in way over his head ” received calls from both the chief of staff and Jared Kushner — Trump’s son-in-law  senior adviser and enforcer — and said Monday that he thought the White House was working to remedy its challenges.
 Trump ’s legislative affairs team — headed by Rick Dearborn and Marc Short  both veterans of the Hill — is also considered well-liked  disciplined and professional. But congressional staffers say they have been given advance notice about some executive orders on topics such as cybersecurity and Guantanamo Bay that have never materialized  a delay they attribute to chaos within the West Wing.

input: Another conservative outsider  successful businessman and conservative state Representative Mike Braun of Jasper   has announced  he  is entering a 2018 Indiana Republican Senate Primary.
 Braun  is the founder and CEO of Meyer Distributing  a nationwide auto parts distribution company with locations in 38 states and headquartered in Jasper  Indiana.
AP reports  Braun  correctly observing that the increasingly bitter feud between Messer and Rokita is turning off voters.  He  says harsh words between the two will only tear down the eventual Republican nominee and boost incumbent Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly's re-election chances.
âI made my career in the private sector. Our country needs more people who can tackle big issues from perspectives gained from running a business and not a career politicianâs perspective â  Braun  stated in  his  announcement. âIâve spent my life building a business and creating jobs. I am running for US Senate because we need leaders who understand the real consequences of the failure of our federal government and are capable of delivering solutions for Hoosiers on issues like health care and tax reform.â
âJoe Donnelly has consistently voted with the liberals in Washington. Donnelly voted for Obamacare  Obamaâs radical Supreme Court justices  trillions in reckless spending and debt  and stood with Barack Obama as he worked to destroy this country. Now he is standing with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer as they block President Trumpâs efforts to bring real conservative change to Washington â charged  Braun .
âI am ready to go to Washington to deliver Donald Trump reinforcements as he takes on the DC swamp. Last yearâs presidential election showed that Hoosiers know outsiders with business experience are the countryâs best hope to fix the broken political system in Washington. Most importantly  Hoosiers want leaders who can break the hold career politicians have on the system and make conservative change happen. Itâs time to replace Joe Donnelly with a Hoosier conservative who can get the job done. That is what I will do in Washington â  Braun  said.
Braun  who has pledged to invest  his  own money to put  his  campaign on the same footing as the better-known Rokita and Messer is already emphasizing  his  outsider status.
""Last year's presidential election showed that Hoosiers know outsiders with business experience are the country's best hope to fix the broken political system in Washington ""  Braun  said in a statement.
 Braun  has also placed  himself  squarely behind President Trumpâs make America great again agenda  saying  he  pledged to help President Donald Trump ""as  he  takes on the D.C. swamp"" and incisively portraying Democratic incumbent Senator Joe Donnelly as an ally of liberals in Congress.
 Mike Braun  is a smart guy and successful businessman who spent the summer gauging interest among the Hoosier stateâs grassroots Republicans.  He âs got the resources to be competitive and  he âs clearly taken the lay of the political landscape and determined thereâs a hole in the marketplace for an outsider candidate.  He  will be a formidable candidate if  he  can stay the course of pushing the Trump MAGA agenda  while avoiding a mudwrestling match with Rokita and Messer.

input: MANCHESTER  England (Reuters) - British finance minister Philip Hammond defended capitalism as the only route to prosperity on Monday  in an attempt to counter the opposition Labour Partyâs increasingly popular vision for a more centrally-controlled economy.
In a speech to the ruling Conservative Party that contained only two new policy announcements   Hammond  also said that the governmentâs immediate task was to deal with the uncertainty for citizens and businesses resulting from Brexit.
 Hammond   who was sidelined by May during the election campaign  said last weekâs Labour Party conference showed it wanted to impose on Britain  the worldâs fifth largest economy  the âsocialist fantasyâ seen in Cuba  Venezuela or Zimbabwe.
âWe saw Labour in the raw  exposed for what it has sadly become: a party taken hostage by a clique of hard-left extremist infiltrators  people who despise Britainâs values and talk down our country â  Hammond  told Conservative Party activists.
Seeking to put the economy center-stage in the Conservativesâ pitch to voters   Hammond  said Britain could only hope to experience rising living standards âby harnessing the power of the market economyâ.
With opinion polls showing Labour gaining support   Hammond  aims to convince voters that Corbyn would make them poorer.
Labourâs leaders   he  said  âopenly proclaim their ambition to demolish our successful modern market economy and replace it with a back-to-the-future socialist fantasy with hundreds of billions of extra debt for the next generation to pay.â
âOur economy is not broken: It is fundamentally strong â  Hammond  said  while also accepting that a lack of progress in talks on Britainâs divorce settlement with the European Union and uncertainty over future ties were weighing on businesses.
âThe process of negotiating our exit from the EU has created uncertainty so investment has slowed as businesses wait for clarity â  Hammond  said.
 Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond  speaks at the Conservative Party's conference in Manchester  Britain October 2  2017. REUTERS/PHIL NOBLE
Business groups welcomed Hammondâs defense of free markets  but said the government needed to do much more.
 Hammond  pledged 400 million pounds ($535 million) of additional road and rail spending and 10 billion pounds of funding to help young Britons get on the property ladder.
âWe must never deny or dismiss the underlying concerns that the election articulated: we must listen to them and we must respond â  Hammond  said  adding that the government should offer âpragmatic solutionsâ to improve ordinary peopleâs lives.
But with Brexit on the horizon  a slowing economy and the Bank of England hinting that interest rates could rise  May and  Hammond  have limited room for fiscal maneuver.
Labour said Hammondâs speech on Monday was disappointing.

input: WASHINGTON â  Anthony Scaramucci   President Trump's former communications director  is on a list of people blocked from entering the White House without special approval.
A day after saying he wasn't blocked  a White House official confirmed that  Scaramucci  is indeed among fired officials excluded from the campus. The acknowledgment came after the financier provided to Bloomberg News official White House correspondence that confirmed he was denied an appointment.
 Scaramucci  is among a group of former staffers who left ""under adverse circumstances"" placed on an ""administrative exclusion list "" the White House said in response to Bloomberg's questions. Those former employees must have any appointments on the premises ""evaluated on a case by case basis.""
 Scaramucci  provided emails indicating  he  had been denied access to the complex to counter a White House official's assertion Thursday that  his  claim of being blacklisted from the building was false. At the time  the official - who requested anonymity to discuss personnel matters - said  Scaramucci  was treated the same as any former staffer and would be granted access if  he  had legitimate  official business.
 Scaramucci  slams 'General Jackass' Kelly for blocking W.H. access
When an aide on Feb. 6 tried to get  Scaramucci  into the building  the Secret Service agent in charge of the appointment-scheduling system emailed that  Scaramucci  is ""administratively excluded from entering the complex at this time (not allowed access)."" The agent referred questions to White House Management and Administration staffer Monica Block.
Another message shows that when the aide asked Block about access for  Scaramucci   Block said only White House chief of staff John Kelly or deputy chief of staff Joe Hagin could override Scaramucci's exclusion.
The former communications adviser believes Kelly is blocking his access to the president.  Scaramucci  called for the chief of staff's resignation last month after disclosures that former staff secretary Rob Porter kept his job with access to top-secret information despite a background investigation that revealed allegations of domestic abuse by two of Porter's ex-wives.

The dispute over access to the White House comes as  Scaramucci  has renewed his offensive against Kelly following a chaotic week that included the resignation of Hope Hicks  a longtime Trump loyalist who now holds the communications director position.
""Does the president want to lose everyone because of General Jackass?""  Scaramucci  said Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg News  warning there would be ""a further evacuation of talent.""

Kelly on Friday defended  his  handling of the Porter scandal in a discussion with reporters  saying  he  had obtained a resignation from the former aide within hours of learning of the abuse allegations and tightened access to classified material at the White House. Kelly did acknowledge a ""disconnect"" at the White House in evaluating Porter's background check and a ""mix-up"" in issuing a public statement supportive of the former staff secretary despite the allegations.

 Delegate-Elect Lee Carter  Urges Virginians  State Water Board to Reject Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley Pipeline Projects
“Dominion Resources and EQT have not compellingly demonstrated the need for the additional natural gas capacity in Virginia ” said  Carter . “And to make matters worse  that natural gas wouldn’t even be used for Virginian homes – the pipeline will run through the Commonwealth and be sent to Japan and India for export.”
 Carter  also has concerns that the project will massively increase Virginia’s carbon footprint  and destroy protected wilderness areas  as well as state and federal parks.
“Hardworking Virginians are going to end up paying for these unnecessary projects through higher power bill  in spite of the lack of economic benefit for Virginia  and if anything goes wrong with the pipeline  thousands of those Virginians will be in the ‘incineration zone’ – an area where all life would be incinerated if the pipeline explodes ” said  Carter .
 Carter  urges all to attend the Water is Life Rally in Richmond on December 2 from 1 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.
“Virginians need to fight back hard against these projects that are not only unnecessary – they’re dangerous ” said  Carter .
 He  also urges residents to attend the State Water Control Board’s meetings on December 6 and 7 and December 11 and 12 for the pipeline projects  and speak on their concerns about how these projects hurt our communities.

input: Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart  is going to court to unmask the person who alleged in emails to politicians  Chicago police investigators and journalists that  Dart  attacked  his  wife at their South Side home.
 Dart  filed the legal papers Wednesday in his personal capacity  not as sheriff  and hired lawyer John F. Winters Jr.  who specializes in defamation cases. Such court filings are often a prelude to a defamation lawsuit filed against the person behind anonymous emails or web postings.
“ Tom  has been subjected to sustained attacks on  his  integrity  and even threats to  his  life  during  his  tenure as sheriff ” said Dennis Culloton  who is acting as  Dart ’s personal spokesman  in a statement. “Over the past several months  these attacks have escalated to include false and vicious rumors involving his wife and family  perpetuated by cowards who hide behind fake email addresses and anonymous blogs. Through this filing we hope to hold those people accountable.”
The first of two October emails cited in the filing allege  Dart  “committed a Domestic Battery” on his wife “causing visible injuries to her face” that were observed by responding Chicago and Cook County sheriff’s police on either Oct. 11 or 12. They allege a police report was taken but that the attacker was listed as “unknown” and that a 911 call was placed to  Dart ’s home.
“This incident is being attempted to be swept under the rug ” the email’s author  who describes himself as a “Cook County taxpayer” named “Dan ” writes.  “Tom Dart  should not be able to get away with this!”
Records show a complaint was also made to a Chicago police oversight agency in October alleging that police refused to act or take reports “in regards to an incident that occurred at  Sheriff Tom Dart’s  home that involved  his  wife and  his  girlfriend.”

input: Gary Kaplan  50  must also forfeit $43.6 million in illegally obtained revenue as part of a plea agreement. Prosecutors have said that amounts to more than half of Kaplan's total worth.
 Kaplan pleaded guilty in August to racketeering conspiracy  violating the Wire Wager Act and conspiring to violate it. Prosecutors had been investigating offshore sports gambling since 1997  and BetOnSports since 2001.
 Kaplan  sentenced to four years and three months  could end up spending another year behind bars. He has been jailed for two years and seven months since his March 2007 arrest in Puerto Rico. U.S. District Judge Carol Jackson said it will be up to the Bureau of Prisons to determine if he is given credit for time served. Attorneys in the case noted that federal rules call for him serving 85 percent of the 51-month sentence  minus whatever credit he may be given for time served.
 In his guilty plea in August  Kaplan said BetOnSports had 1 million registered customers and accepted more than 10 million sports bets worth more than $1 billion in 2004 alone. HisHis company  by then based in Costa Rica  employed 1 700 people.
 Kaplan took BetOnSports public on the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market in 2004  which netted him more than $100 million that was deposited in Swiss bank accounts. For the next two years  he served as a BetOnSports consultant.
 Prosecutors said the company falsely advertised that its gambling operations were legal  and misled gamblers into believing that money transferred to BetOnSports was safe and available to withdraw at any time. Instead  investigators said  the money was used to expand operations  including purchase of a rival betting firm.
 Kaplan told Jackson in August that he initially believed that adhering to the laws in Aruba  Antigua  Costa Rica  the Dominican Republic and the United Kingdom kept him in good stead with U.S. laws. But he said he became aware as early as 2000 that such dealings violated U.S. law  and got confirmation in a legal opinion in 2002. Yet  he kept operating.
 Kaplan apologized to the judge Monday for the ""pain and embarrassment"" he caused to his family  and said he'd ""paid a monumental price for poor decisions."" His attorneys said that Kaplan  from his jail cell  has made six-figure contributions to St. Louis-area charities in recent months.
 Jackson said while recognizing Kaplan's generosity  she was ""a little put off"" by letters she's received from those charities on his behalf.
 ""When I make a charitable contribution  I don't expect credit "" she said. ""I hope you will continue to support worthy charitable organizations even when it doesn't further any personal interest you may have.""

This week  the Natural History Museum in London released images of Cheddar Man  a dark-skinned Mesolithic man believed to be one of the oldest modern humans in Britain.  Nehlen  posted the couple's official engagement photo with Cheddar Man's face superimposed on Markle's  who is biracial.  He  captioned the tweet  ""Honey does this tie make my face look pale?""
The tweet is hardly  Nehlen 's first instance of controversy. The politician has made waves for racist and anti-Semitic tweets in the past and proclaimed that ""Jews control the media"" on former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke's podcast last month.
 Nehlen  ""has spent months curating an image of a sometimes ironic  but most certainly sincere  white nationalist willing to say things intended to push populist nationalism into the discourse "" writes the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Twitter  which does not normally comment on individual accounts  confirmed to NPR that  Nehlen  was permanently suspended for repeated violations of  its  terms of service.

input: Sarah Huckabee Sanders  works in  her  office at the White House in Washington. (Evan Vucci/AP)
This is the world as seen through the eyes of  White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders :
 Sanders  described this perpetual interloper experience from her other world: an elegant  well-appointed office at the White House  where reporters from places such as the New York Times and CNN metaphorically prostrate themselves at her door day in and out  and from where she can receive guidance on the phone every day from her father  long a political darling of conservative Christians  a TV celebrity now worth millions.
As the public face of the U.S. president   Sanders  is a fitting symbol for her fellow religious conservatives  who are both insider and outsider  powerful and powerless.
 Sandersâs  podium persona is all business  even a bit short at times. She so often says she doesnât know the answer to a question or will have to get back to the questioner that it has become a criticsâ meme. âSaturday Night Liveâ featured a spoof of her on its season opener the weekend before last  with faux  Sanders  telling President Trump that her success lies in the fact that âIâm no-nonsense  but Iâm all nonsense.â
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Sept. 13 ESPN anchor Jemele Hill's comments calling President Trump a white supremacist were a ""fireable offense."" ESPN said Hillâs comments do not represent their position. (Reuters)
Facing judgment is part of being Sarah Huckabee Sanders  perhaps the most visible evangelical in U.S. political life (aside from Mike Pence  but Sanders is on the news every day). But unlike her father  Sanders never intended to be the face of anything; until a few months ago  she was known as a behind-the-scenes talented political organizer.
âIn terms of political power  [Christian conservatives] donât have any. I think  Sarah  gets that â said Tyler  long an outspoken Trump critic. âThe ethical challenges of  her  job are amazing. . . . The consistent falsehoods  lies [from Trump] are unbelievable.â
Brian Kaylor  a Baptist pastor with a PhD in political communications who has written several books about religion and politics  thinks  Sanders  holds this view of a divine plan and it gives her confidence at the podium.
 Sanders  doesnât talk about God publicly often â not nearly as much as Trump does these days. People who worked with her on campaigns say sheâd say a pre-event prayer but otherwise was focused on things such as voter strategy. Her faith life mirrors younger evangelicals with their move away from denominations.
A family friend describes  Sanders  and her husband  Bryan Sanders  as âprogressive Christians.â In a compromise  they go to evangelical and Catholic churches every Sunday.
To many religious conservatives   Sanders  is a source of enormous pride. The presence of someone from her background representing the president every day â not to mention the multiple other conservative Christians in Trumpâs Cabinet â has huge symbolic weight  whether or not she has influence or even much contact with  him  and seems to often learn of  his  controversial tweets at the same time the public does.
David Brody  chief political correspondent for the Christian network CBN  said that when  Sanders  comes on the networkâs pro-Trump talk show  âthe social media director said he has never seen so many emoji hearts. . . . She has a charm about her. Sheâs feisty but in a bless-your-heart sort of way.â
Brody said his viewers were wowed by a briefing over the summer  when  Sanders  was asked whether Trump brought low the office of the president by tweeting a crack about television host Mika Brzezinski  whom he called âlow IQ  crazyâ and whom he said he saw âbleeding badly from a face lift.â
Some religious conservatives say one of  Sandersâs  best attributes is that she isnât Sean Spicer. They just want someone at the podium who can defend Trump somewhat effectively without becoming the story.
 Sanders  has a leg up perhaps  as politics is her family business.

 ""Around 85 to 90 percent of our (environmental) concerns have been addressed. The process of building the Navi Mumbai airport can start today. With these compromises we are fully on board and will ensure speedy work "" Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh told the media here.
 The Navi Mumbai airport  which has been planned some 30 kilometers away from the current Chattrapati Shivaji airport in Mumbai  had been a contentious issue because of its environmental impact due to its location. But  the Indian Environment Ministry finally cleared the project.
 Claiming that the plans for the airport have been modified so that one river instead of two will be diverted  the minister said: ""River Gadhi would not be diverted to make way for the airport and added that 161 hectares of mangroves would fall under Navi Mumbai airport.""

input: It was a connection that kept the 15-year-old mom  Cherish Coates  coming back to the nursery each day to visit the baby and drop off breast milk. For the next several weeks   Coates  leaned on Joseph for support as the young mother began the process of putting the baby up for adoption. She relied on the nurse even more when she ultimately decided to tell her family â who had no idea she had given birth to a son in her own bedroom â about the baby  and to keep him  against all odds.
Although the nurse and mother eventually lost touch  their connection inspired  Coates  to become a nurse and eventually enter law school  with hopes of becoming a mental health attorney.

(Nancy Stone/Chicago Tribune)
After 12 years with almost no contact   Coates  reached out to Joseph on Facebook last year with a message that reunited the two women who said they had never forgotten each other. Since then  the pair have been in regular contact  sharing encouragement  photos and a bond that even they sometimes can't believe began more than decade ago with the case still known at the hospital as the ""shoebox baby.""
""I just wanted to let  her  know how much of an impression  she  made "" said  Coates   now a 29-year-old mother of three  including the now 5-foot-3  13-year-old Allen  the baby in the shoebox who brought  her  and Joseph together and is now a thriving eighth-grader.
""It feels like such a blessing "" said  Coates   who works as a law clerk in Mesa  Ariz.  while attending law school. ""We will always be connected because we share this unique story.""
 Coates  grew up painfully aware of the difficulties of teen pregnancies.  Her  own mother was 15 when  she  had Coates  whom  she  left to be raised by  her  loving and devoted grandparents in Rockford.  Her  mother  who dropped out of school and moved out  visited weekly. Family members often warned  Coates  that a pregnancy while  she  was young could keep  her  from becoming the first in  her  family to finish high school and go to college â something they were all rooting for   she  said.
Despite  her  grandparents' best efforts  Coates  at 13 years old  met a boy two years older than  her  while shopping at Cherryvale Mall in Rockford. It didn't take long before  she  and the boy were together every weekend  spending time at the mall and at the movies.
The couple had been inseparable for nearly two years when  Coates  suspected  she  might be pregnant.  She  shared the news with  her  boyfriend  who cried along with  her  as the terrified teens repeatedly discussed what they should do.
 Coates  didn't have to try hard to conceal the small bump that eventually surfaced in  her  belly  because it was barely noticeable.  She  hid morning sickness  kept up  her  A and B grades  and never missed a shift at  her  part-time job at McDonalds   she  said.

He was wrapped in a dish towel and placed in a shoebox with a note asking that he be taken care of and named Allen Corey. The young couple chose to take him there under the stateâs 2001 Safe Haven law  which allows parents to leave a newborn at a hospital  fire station or police station without fear of criminal or civil liability.

Moments later  Coates delivered her baby on the SpongeBob SquarePants comforter covering her bed. She cut  his  umbilical cord with scissors her grandfather had in the house.
""I remember just looking at how beautiful  he  was  and how tiny  he  was. I had never held a baby before; I had never baby-sat or anything "" Coates said. ""I remember being scared that I was going to break  him .""

input: Norway ’ s $ 1 trillion sovereign wealth fund will this year step up its assessment of the risks posed by climate change to its investments in power producers   oil firms and basic materials companies   its CEO told Reuters on Tuesday . Separately   the board of the central bank will soon decide whether to blacklist from the fund one or more companies -- either in the oil   steel or concrete sectors -- for producing too much greenhouse gases   the central bank chief told Reuters . The fund   which invests the proceeds from Norway ’ s oil and gas production for future pensions in stocks   bonds and real estate abroad   is one of the world ’ s biggest shareholders   with stakes totaling 1 . 4 percent of all listed companies . In recent years the world ’ s biggest sovereign wealth fund has become a more active shareholder   trying to influence companies ’ attitudes . Among them are the way companies report on climate change   such as their carbon dioxide emissions   or whether companies have scenario analyses of how more heatwaves   droughts or floods might affect their earnings .  Chief Executive Yngve Slyngstad  said the fund would first focus  its  efforts on electricity producers . “ That is ... the sector that we will first go through and think about in this scenario . The two next ones will be ( basic ) materials and oil .” “ By far the largest ... is electricity producers   which of course has been a specific focus for us because of the so - called coal criteria  ” he said referring to the fund not being allowed by parliament to invest in firms that derive more than 30 percent of their revenue from coal . The proposal to potentially exclude one or more companies in the oil   steel or cement sectors over excessive greenhouse gas emissions is under review by the board of the central bank . “ We have received some recommendations on potential exclusions based on that new criteria . The board is working on the issues ... It ’ s not going to be long  ” central bank governor Oeystein Olsen said   declining to give a more precise timeframe . Slideshow ( 2 Images ) The moves come as the fund is proposing to drop oil and gas stocks from its benchmark index   which would reduce over time its stakes in oil and gas companies . That proposal is under consideration at the finance ministry and will be voted by parliament at a later stage . DOUBLED ITS RETURN IN 2017 Also on Tuesday   the fund said it doubled its return on investment in 2017   beating its benchmark   as strong global stock markets boosted the value of the portfolio . It earned a return of 13 . 7 percent in 2017   up from 6 . 9 percent in 2016 . “ The fund ’ s cumulative return since inception has passed 4   000 billion Norwegian crowns ($ 511 billion ). One out of four crowns of return was generated in 2017   after a very strong year for the fund  ” Slyngstad said in a statement . “ Again   our equity investments returned strongest with a return close to 20 percent .” The fund ’ s biggest single company investment at the end of 2017 was in Apple Inc ( AAPL . O )  worth 66 billion crowns   ahead of Nestle ( NESN . S ) at 51 billion and Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa . L ) at 50 billion . Apple was also the biggest single contributor to the fund ’ s returns in 2017   ahead of Chinese tech group Tencent Holdings ( 0700 . HK ) and Microsoft ( MSFT . O ). The fund ’ s size is equivalent to $ 200   000 for every Norwegian man   woman and child . The government withdrew 61 billion crowns during 2017 to pay for public expenses   compared with 101 billion crowns in 2016 .  Slyngstad  earned an annual salary of 6 . 7 million crowns   or roughly $ 855   000   in 2017   while  his  chief investment officer for equity strategies   Petter Johnsen   earned more   with 7 . 4 million crowns . By comparison   the country ’ s prime minister   Erna Solberg   earned 1 . 6 million crowns .

Now complete the following example-
input: The camera pans across a bucolic river and a sunny cornfield  an American flag flapping in the breeze  as narrator Michael Steele extols the freedom to dream and achieve. Then  with the Statue of Liberty sweeping into the shot  comes a dire warning that freedom is fragile: Democrats  he says  are ""experimenting with America.""
The camera zooms in on a bespectacled Steele  who asks viewers for donations. ""Our freedom "" he says with a smile. ""It's worth fighting for.""
The television advertisement  which aired in selected markets last month  is vintage Steele _ affable  charismatic and seizing the spotlight. But the ad's star is not running for anything. He's the chairman of the Republican National Committee  with a mandate to promote his party rather than himself.
Steele has put a public face on what had been largely a behind-the-scenes job  hoping to foster what he has called a ""hip-hop"" Republican renaissance. That high profile has been accompanied by a record of lavish spending and a string of gaffes  leading some party activists to complain that Steele revels in the perks of the office while neglecting some of the onerous work necessary to reclaim majorities in the House and Senate. This narrative grew more damaging last week with the disclosure that RNC staffers approved a $1 900 bill at a Hollywood nightclub that features topless dancers mimicking lesbian sex acts while wearing bondage gear.
Still there have been no calls for Steele's ouster  and some top Republicans have calculated that there is no upside in forcing out the first black chairman of a party largely dominated by white Southerners _ especially not while the GOP is winning under his watch. Steele claimed credit for recent Republican victories in Massachusetts  Virginia and New Jersey  telling reporters in January: ""I won two governorships and a host of special elections.""
Some Republicans question Steele's contribution to the party's recent successes. Nevertheless  ""To the victor go the spoils "" said Ron Kaufman  a former RNC chairman who worked against Steele in the leadership race. ""Is the party better off today than the day Michael Steele got elected? It's very hard to say no  on almost every level. ... The bottom line is the coach gets the credit. They're paid to win  and we're winning.""
To understand how this one-term lieutenant governor from Maryland became his party's national chairman  go back to the day he was selected  Jan. 30  2009. It was one week after Obama's historic inauguration  and many in the Republican Party were demoralized and seeking new direction.
In a crowded field of candidates for the chairmanship  Steele stood out _ a 6-foot-4  dapper  television-friendly former politician who spoke eloquently of expanding the party's base to include more blacks and Latinos. He offered a break with history as the first African American chairman of what he referred to over and over again as the ""party of Lincoln.""
""The party has really wallowed in the sewers of racial politics in the country "" said NAACP President Ben Jealous  a longtime Steele friend. ""Mike Steele is their chance to get back on higher ground.""
Steele was distrustful of the staff he inherited and the Beltway strategists who cycled through the committee. ""When they drink that Potomac River water a while  it changes them  and Michael has tried never to drink that water "" said John Kane  a close friend who ran the Maryland Republican Party when Steele was lieutenant governor.
So less than a week after his election  Steele asked each staffer to submit a resignation letter. They were told the chairman would decide who could stay  former aides recalled. He let dozens go.
In his early months  Steele  who had been a Fox News Channel commentator  gave several interviews that led to damaging blunders. On CNN  Steele dismissed Rush Limbaugh  a popular voice for the right  as an ""entertainer"" and said Limbaugh's radio talk show can be ""incendiary"" and ""ugly."" He told GQ magazine that abortion was ""an individual choice "" going against his party's antiabortion platform.
Meanwhile  he was making cosmetic changes to the party operation. Steele disliked the dark-wood furnishings in his office  telling GQ it was ""way too male for me."" So he had the RNC spend $18 500 on a new wooden desk  armchairs  a couch and art for the walls  according to aides.
When Steele hit the road to meet local volunteers and operatives  he often brought a photographer to document it all. At party headquarters in Washington  the hallways were decorated with jumbo-size pictures of Steele shaking hands.
Steele declined several requests for interviews for this story because he believes he has received unfair scrutiny from The Washington Post dating to his political career in Maryland  his spokesman Doug Heye said. ""Profile after profile after profile by The Washington Post that almost borders on stalking "" Heye said. ""At a certain point you just stop taking it seriously.""
This report is based on Steele's public comments and interviews with more than three dozen RNC members  donors  party strategists and state officials  as well as Steele's friends  political opponents and current and former aides. They portrayed a complex man who  like most people  is a combination of traits  not 100 percent an industrious political strategist or a feckless self-promoter.

 The Cornhuskers seemed to snare a bit of their lost aura in 2008  winning six of their last seven games. But Suh is hardly ready to compare his defensive unit to those from the glory days.
 In fact  continuing the rebuilding process is one reason why the defensive tackle returned for his senior year instead of being an almost guaranteed high pick in the NFL draft.
 ""I definitely want to be part of bringing back the tradition of the Blackshirts "" said Suh  the Big 12's preseason defensive player of the year. ""That's a tough tradition to live up to.""
 Under defensive-minded new head coach Bo Pelini  the respective numbers above improved to 349.8  28.5 and 49 -- better  but still not what Suh and Pelini consider acceptable.
 ""We're getting closer "" Suh said  ""but we're definitely not where we need to be. We still have room to grow.""
 But with an untested quarterback at the controls of an offense with just four starters returning  it will be up to Suh and the defense to keep the Huskers afloat early in the season. Suh says he's looking forward to the task.
 ""I definitely want to be part of bringing back the tradition of the Blackshirts "" he said. ""We want to start being the kind of dominant team that everyone wants to hunt.""
 Pelini says Suh is that kind of talent.

input: It was deja vu all over again. With Senate Republicans inching closer to passing an Obamacare replacement bill  a potential fulfillment of seven years of campaign promises   Arizona Senator John McCain  once again intervened to save the failing law.  He  dramatically cast the deciding vote to kill a drastically pared-down ""skinny repeal"" bill over the summer  then reprised the spoiler role on Friday afternoon by announcing  his  opposition to legislation championed by  his  close friend and ally  Sen. Lindsey Graham. Between  McCain 's statement and Rand Paul's unconvincing 'purity' posture  Mitch McConnell can't afford to lose a single additional member of his caucus. The truth is  he already has. Anyone who's followed Susan Collins' record on this issue knows that Graham-Cassidy is dead. She's technically only ""leaning"" no  but that's tantamount to a hard no; I'm fairly certain she'd vote against her own Obamacare replacement plan at this point. In revealing his intention to torpedo the latest bill -- with just days remaining before the GOP's reconciliation authority expires  according to the Senate Parliamentarian  -- McCain  used process concerns as  his  primary fig leaf:
In what way is working with Democrats  who are either staunch Obamacare defenders or already moving on to an even bigger government power-grab  likely make healthcare reform better? Like Rand Paul's weak excuse for opposing Graham-Cassidy (given his vote in favor of skinny repeal  which did far less to uproot Obamacare)   McCain 's justification makes little sense. Part of  his  Hamlet act on the previous Senate repeal bill (BCRA) was an insistence that  he  couldn't approve a plan that didn't have the full backing of  his  state's governor  Doug Ducey. ""My position on this proposal will be largely guided by Governor Ducey's analysis of how it would impact the people of our state ""  McCain  claimed at the time. ""My friends  this is legislation that directly affects the people of my state. I trust my governor."" Ducey had raised objections to the BCRA  publicly stating that he agreed with  McCain  that it was fatally flawed. While the governor eventually cleared  McCain  to back ""skinny repeal"" as a means to advancing the process to a conference committee  his concerns about the legislation's underlying content made  McCain 's 'no' vote easier. But guess who explicitly supported the passage of Graham-Cassidy this time? Governor Doug Ducey. Apparently ""trusting his governor"" no longer mattered to McCain. And then there's this:

McCain rightly and ruthlessly blasted his Democratic opponent as a supporter of a law that was inflicting disproportionate harm on Arizonans. Then he proceeded to vote exactly as she would have. The Senator's new position is that a bipartisan ""fix"" is in order. How would his campaign have gone if he'd told voters  ""by 'we must repeal and replace Obamacare ' what I really mean is  'we must work with Patty Murray and the Democrats to tweak Obamacare after promising to abandon repeal'""? Perhaps he'd be former Senator John McCain  no longer in a position to be hailed as a ""hero"" by the exact same people who passionately opposed and slandered him during his presidential run  and who would have called him every name under the sun if he'd reached a different conclusion about a bill written and sponsored by his best friend in Congress. I'll leave you with some journalists wondering if Graham-Cassidy may still have a glimmer of life:

 At the same time  cyber experts and potential job candidates have complained that the position lacks the budgetary and policy-making authority needed to be successful. Schmidt will report to the National Security Council and closely support the National Economic Council on cyber issues.
 Schmidt's selection suggests that economic and business interests in the White House held more sway in the selection process. Schmidt  president and CEO of the Information Security Forum  a nonprofit international consortium that conducts research in information security  has served as chief security officer for Microsoft and as cyber security chief for online auction giant eBay. He was reportedly preferred by Lawrence Summers  director of the economic council. A good format for the titel can be the simple subject + object + verb.

 ""Around 85 to 90 percent of our (environmental) concerns have been addressed. The process of building the Navi Mumbai airport can start today. With these compromises we are fully on board and will ensure speedy work "" Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh told the media here.
 The Navi Mumbai airport  which has been planned some 30 kilometers away from the current Chattrapati Shivaji airport in Mumbai  had been a contentious issue because of its environmental impact due to its location. But  the Indian Environment Ministry finally cleared the project.
 Claiming that the plans for the airport have been modified so that one river instead of two will be diverted  the minister said: ""River Gadhi would not be diverted to make way for the airport and added that 161 hectares of mangroves would fall under Navi Mumbai airport.""

input: Hakeem Nicks and Eli Manning of the New York Giants forged a friendship over cookouts of alligator  crawfish and fried quail. Nicks mostly abstained from eating at the barbecues. It was the conversation that mattered.
 In July  Nicks joined Manning on a four-day trip in Thibodaux  La.  for the Manning Passing Academy  an offensive skills camp for high school players. The getaway brought them together  helping to bond a young play-making wide receiver with a veteran quarterback who could use a big-play target.
 During the day  Nicks served as a counselor and played catch with Manning. By night  Nicks and Manning came together for group dinners before retreating to their dormitories at Nicholls State University  about an hour west of New Orleans.
Nicks and Manning came together for group dinners before retreating to their dormitories at Nicholls State University  about an hour west of New Orleans.
 Still  the coaches are looking for Nicks  who showed explosiveness as a rookie in 2009  to show more consistency in his second season. (On Sunday  Nicks also tipped the first pass his way  which resulted in an interception). Nicks  the type of deep threat the Giants have been missing since the departure of Plaxico Burress  was drafted into an important position. ""That's something I want to do "" Nicks said. ""That's something that I've always done in my career in my past  been that big-target receiver coming deep down the field. I just want to get my game to that and bring it to the team the best way possible.""
 Manning invited Nicks and Steve Smith to join him for the camp this summer. Although Smith could not attend  he said that he has seen the effect the trip has had on the relationship between Nicks and Manning.
 ""It showed Eli he's serious about football and that he wants to get better "" Smith said of Nicks. ""I've seen him take it more seriously in the film room and get in here in the offseason.""
 When discussing certain plays at the camp  Manning would explain his thinking  then Nicks would share his thoughts. It helped their timing  which was important because Nicks missed practices during organized-team activities and in training camp while recovering from knee and toe injuries.
 Off the field  Nicks and Manning watched sports in their rooms and shared insights into each other's lives. Manning was shocked to hear that Nicks had only one scholarship offer in high school. Nicks was shocked to see the type of food the Manning family served in New Orleans.
 The Cajun flavor was new to Nicks -- ""out of my bracket "" the North Carolina native said -- but he enjoyed learning more about the area.

 Like Burress  Nicks is the X receiver  known also as the split end  in the Giants' offense. The X receiver frequently represents the deep threat and often finds himself in one-on-one coverage  as Nicks did on his second and third touchdowns Sunday.

Now complete the following example-
input: The new  Mario  game has some serious film noir vibes. Fans on Twitter have been picking up on the crooked stink of New Donk City since the game came out  but the idea seems to have solidified with the brilliant help of the Storied podcast. The podcast goes on a journey with co-hosts Sean Ainsworth  Harrison Pink  and Chris Rebbert as they transform famous films  TV shows  and games into other mediums.
Presumably inspired by the recent rumors that an official Super Mario Bros. movie is in the works  the hosts pondered the best method for bringing  Mario 's pixels onto the silver screen. Sure  the happy-go-lucky world of Nintendo might not scream ""gritty monochromatic detective drama."" But you're clearly just not paying attention (or exploring Photo Mode in Super Mario Odyssey.)
Their proposed script begins with a panning shot over pictures of a smiling Luigi  as  Mario  grieves over the death of his brother and the better half of their Super Mario Bros. P. I. firm. His voiceover is all tough talk  while maintaining the trademark cartoonish Italian stereotype we've come to love.
What proceeds is your usual  Mario  game plot  with a damsel in distress who needs the help of a hero to escape a mafia-style boss with tons of goons stalking about town. Bowser  a local land baron in the tradition of Chinatown  is up to his no-good tricks and is trying to marry her and take all her inheritance money.
If anyone is wondering  I've got this frame of Mario Odyssey paused  and am currently narrating ""Mario  P.I."" as a film noir series while I have jazz music playing in the background.
In honor of his dead brother   Mario  goes on a wild-goose chase to rescue  his  dame.
Some key scenes include: 1)  Mario  meeting up with Bowser at a country club  with Bowser intimidating the detective by totally owning his opponent in Wii Tennis while  Mario  tries to question him  2) A second femme fatale  in the form of Birdo  who cannot speak English but gives  Mario  an egg with a key piece of evidence before she's murdered  3) One (if not several) car chase scenes  in which the cars are replaced with  Mario  go-karts and the tommy guns replaced with Blue Shells.
But  like any good noir film  the journey ends in deception. As  Mario  gets deeper into the investigation  eventually managing to kill Bowser  he learns a sickening truth. The Koopa King and Drug Lord Bowser was actually just small pennies compared to the real boss in charge: Princess Peach  who runs the drug operation at the heart of the Mushroom Kingdom. She needed a fall guy.  Mario  was her guy. Bowser took the fall.
The story closes on  Mario  as  he  lays dying  and Luigi emerges from the shadows to give the princess a kiss.

input: A massive California wildfire that has already destroyed nearly 800 structures scorched another 56   000 acres on Sunday   making it the fifth largest such blaze in recorded state history   as it ran toward picturesque coastal cities . But fire officials said as darkness fell that with the hot   dry Santa Ana winds not as fierce as expected   crews had been successful in building some fire lines between the flames and the towns of Montecito and Carpinteria . “ This is a menacing fire   certainly   but we have a lot of people working very diligently to bring it under control  ” Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown told an evening press conference . Still   some 5   000 residents remained under evacuation orders in the two communities   near Santa Barbara and about 100 miles ( 160 km ) northwest of Los Angeles . Some 15   000 homes were considered threatened . The Thomas Fire   the worst of six major blazes in Southern California in the last week and already the fifth largest in the state since 1932   has blackened 230   000 acres ( 570   000 hectares )  more than the area of New York City . It has destroyed 790 houses   outbuildings and other structures and left 90   000 homes and businesses without power . The combination of Santa Ana winds and rugged terrain in the mountains that run through Santa Barbara and Ventura counties have hampered firefighting efforts   and officials said the Thomas Fire was only 10 percent contained on Sunday evening   down from 15 percent earlier in the day . But wind gusts recorded at 35 - 40 miles per hour were less than those predicted by forecasters   giving crews a chance to slow the flames ’ progress down slopes above the endangered communities . The fires burning across Southern California have forced the evacuation of more 200   000 people and destroyed some 1   000 structures . Among them are residents of Montecito   one of the state ’ s wealthiest enclave and home to such celebrities as Oprah Winfrey . Emmy Leikin   an Emmy - winning songwriter who was ordered to evacuate her Montecito home at 9 a . m . on Sunday   said she fled with only her cell phone   medication   eyeglasses and a few apples . Leikin   74   said she doesn ’ t know the condition of her home and belongings but “ none of that means anything when it is your safety .” Firefighters knock down flames as they advance on homes atop Shepherd Mesa Road in Carpinteria   California   U .

REUTERS / Mike Eliason / Santa Barbara County Fire Department / Handout via REUTERS WORST IN A DECADE The fires that began last Monday night collectively amounted to one of the worst conflagrations across Southern California in the last decade . They have   however   been far less deadly than the blazes in Northern California ’ s wine country in October that killed over 40 . In the last week   only one death has been reported   a 70 - year - old woman who died Wednesday in a car accident as she attempted to flee the flames in Ventura County . Scores of horses have died   including at least 46 at a thoroughbred training facility in San Diego county . Residents and firefighters alike have been alarmed by the speed with which the fires spread   reaching into the heart of cities like Ventura . Slideshow ( 9 Images ) At the Ventura County Fairgrounds   evacuees slept in makeshift beds while rescued horses were sheltered in stables .  Peggy Scissons   78    arrived at the shelter with  her  dog last Wednesday   after residents of  her  mobile home park were forced to leave .  She  has not yet found out whether  her  home is standing . “ I don ’ t know what ’ s gonna happen next or whether I ’ ll be able to go home  ”  she  said . “ It would be one thing if I were 40 or 50   but I ‘ m 78 . What the heck do I do ?” James Brown   57   who retired from Washington State ’ s forestry service and has lived in Ventura for a year   was forced to leave his house along with his wife last week because both have breathing problems . “ We knew a fire was coming   but we didn ’ t know it would be this bad  ” said Brown   who is in a wheelchair . Some of the other fires   in San Diego and Los Angeles counties   have been largely controlled by the thousands of firefighters on the ground this week . Both the Creek and Rye fires in Los Angeles County were 90 percent contained by Sunday morning   officials said   while the Skirball Fire in Los Angeles ’ posh Bel Air neighborhood was 75 percent contained . North of San Diego   the 4   100 - acre ( 1   660 hectare ) Lilac Fire was 75 percent contained by Sunday and most evacuation orders had been lifted .

input: When  Harvard physician Monique Tello  looks at the typical American breakfast   she  said  it makes  her  ""want to cry.""
""A bowl of cereal  or a bagel  or a piece of toast  or a muffin are all no different than a dessert  "" Tello  wrote in a recent Harvard Health blog post.
""Eating like this may be okay once in a while  but if you do so often  I guarantee these foods will make you sick  one way or another  "" Tello  said.
Here's what  Tello  eats: a combination of berries  Icelandic-style (high protein) yogurt  and a mix of nuts  seeds  and rolled oats.
""Iâm a working mom. I take the train into work. I need something quick  easy  and transportable. Plus  it needs to be budget-friendly  and must hold me over for a number of hours  "" Tello  said.
So  her  breakfast is based around three simple ingredients:
Berries:  Tello  buys a mix of frozen raspberries  blueberries  and strawberries in bulk  since ""fruit is frozen at the peak of freshness  so the quality and vitamin content can be better than whatâs in the produce aisle.""

In his opening remarks at the meeting with  Tillerson   Abadi said Popular Mobilisation âis part of the Iraqi institutions â rejecting accusations that it is acting as an Iranian proxy.
 Tillerson  visited Iraq a day after a rare joint meeting with Abadi and Saudi Arabiaâs King Salman in the Saudi capital  Riyadh.
At his meeting with Abadi in Baghdad   Tillerson  urged the Iraqi government and Masoud Barzaniâs Kurdistan Regional Government in Erbil to resolve their conflict on Kurdish self-determination and disputed territories through dialogue.
âWe are concerned and a bit sad  â Tillerson  said. âWe have friends in Baghdad and friends in Erbil  and we encourage all parties to enter into discussion ... and all differences can be addressed.â
âIranian militias that are in Iraq  now that the fight against Daesh and ISIS is coming to a close  those militias need to go home  â Tillerson  said on Sunday in Saudi Arabia.
One of the closest groups to Iran within Popular Mobilisation  Asaib Ahl al-Haq  reacted to  Tillerson âs comment by saying it would be Americans who will be forced to leave Iraq.

Now complete the following example-
input: Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday to claim that Tennessee Republican helped ""give us"" the nuclear deal with Iran negotiated by President Barack Obama's administration. Earlier this month  he claimed that  Corker  is ""largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!""
 Corker  the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee   was in fact a vehement critic of the deal that emerged from international negotiations in the summer of 2015. After the deal was unveiled   he  wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post that ""Congress should reject this deal and send it back to the President.""
 Corker  plotted efforts to block the deal  banding with Republicans -- and even some Democrats -- in an attempt to block the deal.
The following month   Corker  did just that  joining with the bipartisan group to vote against the deal. A procedural vote to move forward a resolution to reject the nuclear deal fell shy of the required 60-vote threshold.
Even before that vote   Corker  helped push through the legislation that would ultimately grant Congress powers to review the deal  which the Obama administration contemplated approving without congressional oversight.
 Corker  said such an attempt would be ""a direct affront to the American people and seeks to undermine Congress' appropriate role"" in a March 2015 letter to Obama.
 Corker 's calls for congressional review of the nuclear deal that was still being negotiated in the spring of 2015 ultimately led to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act  which Obama ultimately signed despite initially opposing the measure.
That could be what White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was referring to on October 10 when she claimed: "" Sen. Corker  worked with Nancy Pelosi and the Obama administration to pave the way for that legislation and basically rolled out the red carpet for the Iran deal  and those are pretty factual.""
 Corker  defended the bill against that criticism in September 2015  noting that the legislation ""actually took power back from the president.""
""Without it  he could have unilaterally implemented the deal immediately. The President never would have been forced to submit the agreement to Congress and there would have been no review and no debate on this critical national security issue ""  Corker  said then.
Trump's criticism of  Corker  on the Iran deal is also curious given that Trump initially considered  Corker  as a candidate for vice president and later secretary of state  in large part due to his foreign policy chops.

Now complete the following example-
input: Watch the replay of  Benny Cunningham's  23-yard catch-and-run in the second quarter  and two things become clear.
Two   he  screwed up trying to do so.
Let's review: As  Cunningham  juked  his  way to the front right corner of the end zone   he  dove and extended the ball while Packers safety Marwin Evans shoved him out of bounds.  Cunningham  crashed into the pylon as the ball slipped free. Officials ruled  Cunningham  out at the 2-yard line.
""We're taught not to do it; unless it's fourth down  you don't reach the ball out  "" Cunningham  said. ""But  honestly  at the time  I wasn't thinking about that. I was trying to score a touchdown for the team.""
 Fox   under advice from  his  assistants who help with video reviews  challenged the ruling that  Cunningham  stepped out of bounds.
""Every indication we had was  he  scored  "" Fox  said. ""And  if anything   he  would be at the 1 or inside in the 1.""
So rather than have  his  offense line up with three tries from the 2-yard line   Fox  threw the challenge flag with hopes of being awarded a touchdown or  at worst  having the ball advanced a few feet.
But replays showed  Cunningham  lost possession before  he  hit the pylon  which  in the context of the video review  had unintended consequences.
Replay officials in New York decided  Cunningham  lost possession before  he  was out of bounds and before  he  hit the pylon.
""When I watched the review  I felt like they made the right call ""  Cunningham  said. ""Just a bad play on my part  but the refs got it right.""
To  Fox   the fumble wasn't as obvious.
""I think maybe on 50 times  like some people get to look at it  I think maybe you could see that ""  he  said. ""But on our look during the game  that wasn't really even discussed.""
Here's the thing  though:  Cunningham 's left foot dragged onto the sideline as  he  dove for the pylon.
Slow down the replay frame-by-frame and it's still nearly impossible to determine if  Cunningham  lost possession before  his  foot touched the sideline. What's more  as Dean Blandino  the NFL's former head of officiating  explained on Fox Sports  the determining factor should have been whether  Cunningham  was in contact with the ball while  he  was out of bounds and before  he  hit the pylon.
""Even if  he  doesn't have control  and  he 's just touching that loose ball with a foot out of bonds  that would make the play dead prior to it hitting the pylon  and it would not be a touchback.""
In that case  the Bears should have retained possession where  Cunningham  fumbled  the 2.

 ""People use their computers elsewhere and when the computers are done  they're loaded in containers and shipped off "" said Yumkella. ""We are working with agencies to look at how we deal with e-waste.""
 Yumkella acknowledged that IT companies must take an active role in mitigating e-waste but as the saying goes  it's important not to throw out the baby with the bath water.

input: The Daily Wire spoke with Michael Saltsman  the managing director of the Employment Policies Institute (EPI)  for clarification about the study. For background   Saltsman  received degrees in economics and political science from the University of Michigan  and was a field economist for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) from 2006-2009. In addition to his position at EPI   Saltsman  is the vice president of Berman and Company  a public relations firm.
According to  Saltsman   California is an ideal state in which to conduct a study like EPIâs because ""thereâs been a tremendous amount of minimum wage activity  both at the state level and then at the local level."" This didnât come without difficulties  however.  Saltsman  noted that the team had to account for the impact of other economic factors on certain industries  like apparel manufacturing  which has been harmed by factors other than rising minimum wages:
 Saltsman  stated that Macpherson and Even ""threw the kitchen sink"" at this issue  running ""models a number of different ways  accounting for different economic factors and trends that might have influenced the kind of employment trends weâre seeing absent a minimum wage."" Additionally  they looked at data ""county by county "" omitting material they believed was weak or possibly unreliable.
Those hardest hit by minimum wage increases tend to work for businesses that ""donât have a tremendous ability to absorb new labor costs "" according to  Saltsman . Restaurants  for example  tend to have incredibly narrow profit margins  and government-mandated wage hikes force these businesses to cut costs. Unfortunately  cutting costs often means letting go of ""less skilled or less experienced employees "" replacing them with machines  and self-service options.
The best thing to do with government-mandated minimum wages   Saltsman  says  is freeze them. That way  the issue would become ""less and less relevant"" to the conversation.
There are some who argue that a $15 to $20 an hour wage is necessary for basic survival.  Saltsman  counters this contention with a sobering fact: ""You can either have a $15 minimum wage  or you can have have the same number of jobs you have right now. You canât have both.""
 Saltsman  believes in a more targeted approach to helping the working poor:
A more generous Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)  suggests  Saltsman   is one way to help low-wage workers  as ""it has been more effective at reducing poverty than a higher minim wage  itâs better targeted  and creates an incentive to work."" Moreover  ""because itâs targeted through the tax code instead of a mandate on employers  you donât get some of the same unintended consequences"" that come with mandatory minimum wage increases.
 Saltsman  also rebutted the progressive argument that businesses â both small or franchise-based businesses as well as large corporations â should absorb the costs of wage increases  saying that such an idea is ""a pretty dramatic misunderstanding of how these businesses work.""
""Itâs not as if thereâs some pot of corporate cash that franchise businesses are able to tap into  "" Saltsman  stated  adding that franchisees essentially operate as small businesses:
While larger corporations might be better able to absorb certain costs  profit margins are still relatively narrow  according to  Saltsman . Additionally  itâs easy to forget that these companies employ thousands and thousands of people  and face overhead costs.
Regarding the seemingly excessive pay of company executives â something brought up frequently by progressive activists â  Saltsman  offered a rebuttal:
In conclusion  and to further illustrate the speciousness of the minimum wage argument   Saltsman  ran through a common scenario:

input: CNBC's Jim Cramer has been following the bull market in payment processing and the rise of digital transactions for a while  pounding the table on plays like Visa and PayPal.
But there are more ways to play the global cash-to-credit shift besides credit card companies and payment processors  so  Cramer  decided to analyze Global Payments  an international merchant acquirer that enables retailers to accept electronic payments.
""The stock of Global Payments has rocketed up more than 48 percent year to date  so good that  yes  I'm kicking  myself . I wish I had highlighted it earlier "" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""These guys own the client relationships in the payments business and they're the ones who set pricing. They also have some e-commerce  cross-border and gambling-related solutions.""
 Cramer  said Global Payments' outlook drastically improved when it bought Heartland Payment Systems in 2015 for $3.8 billion.
""Meanwhile  Global Payments is looking to expand internationally  "" Cramer  said. ""Right now  the rest of the world accounts for roughly a quarter of the company's sales. Asia  Europe  [the] Middle East  Africa  [and] Latin America is where the real growth is  so they're aggressively trying to take share overseas.""
Typically   Cramer  doesn't like to invest solely on earnings reports. But given Global Payments' bullish guidance  strategic partnership with Vista Equity Partners and e-commerce expansion   he  made an exception to  his  rule regarding the company's third-quarter earnings report on Nov. 8.
""I don't like to game the earnings reports  but if Global Payments delivers another good quarter next week and the stock gets dinged anyway  I wouldn't be surprised if you're getting another buying opportunity ""  he  said.

input: Mere months after being on the receiving end of one of the most stunning losses in presidential election history   former Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook  said thereâs a chance the former secretary of state could run again in 2020.
In an appearance Monday on MSNBC   Mook  was asked by host Greta Van Susteren âwhat are the oddsâ that  Clinton  will run for office again.
âIâm going to let  her  answer for that â  Mook  replied. âI think what happens right now  weâve got to get to the bottom of what happened in 2016  then we can start worrying about the next cycle. But weâve got to make sure that this cannot happen again in two years or four years to anybody else.â
 Mook  also refused to rule out a  Clinton  comeback in 2020 when asked Tuesday by veteran news anchor Dan Rather.
âI have no idea â  Mook  said. âYou genuinely would have to ask  her .â
In recent weeks   Clinton âs name has been linked to reports that  she âs eyeing a political comeback of some kind.
According to TMZ   Clinton  is considering running for New York City mayor â this  despite that a majority of likely voters in the deep blue Big Apple donât want  her  anywhere near city hall.
Still searching for  her  place in a politically frayed Democratic party   Clinton  announced last week at a St Patrickâs Day event in Scranton  Pennsylvania that  she  is âready to  you know  come out of the woods.â

That was the case for  Lea Giovanniello   59  the Virginia woman who found that resuming a full-time job in the technology sector two years ago required hitting the books for a new degree.
 Ms. Giovanniello  stepped away from a fast-track information technology job with Northrop Corporation. Over the course of more than two decades after  she  left   she  taught math and science in public schools and worked in various I.T. positions at embassies and consulates where  her  husband was posted with the foreign service.
When  her  children headed to college   she  decided to restart  her  career. âThe problem is that the tech field keeps moving on at a brisk pace  and my skills were out of date â  Ms. Giovanniello  said. âWhen I started looking at the job listings  it just felt so futile. I probably sent out maybe a dozen rÃ©sumÃ©s and never got back so much as an automatic response.â
 She  earned a master of science degree in computer forensics from George Mason University in 2014. Then  through FlexProfessionals  a part-time job staffing firm   she  was hired by Corsec Security  an I.T. security consulting company in Herndon  Va.  as a part-time computer security engineer.

The departure of  Fischer   73  represents a big loss of institutional knowledge and gravitas for the Fed at a time when many American institutions are sorely lacking in technocratic expertise.  Fischer  is considered the leader of a generation of prominent academic and professional economics  in part because  he  taught many of them at MIT.
"" He  is often referred to as the dean of central bankers  having taught most central bankers including former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and European Central Bank president Mario Draghi "" Shawn Baldwin  the chairman of AIA Group  wrote in a LinkedIn post. "" Fischer 's departure creates a vacuum not easily filled  adding to the uncertainty in monetary policy.""
Larry Summers  the Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary  dubbed  Fischer 's resignation ""the end of an era.""
Fischer  who was born in Zambia and later studied in London  started his career as an academic but became a policymaker at the World Bank and later the International Monetary Fund  where he rose to the role of first deputy managing director.  Fischer  then spent three years at Citigroup as a vice chairman before moving to Israel in 2005 to become the head of its central bank.  Fischer  returned to the US as Fed vice chairman in 2014.  His  term was not set to end until June 2018.
""The Fed and the international monetary system will be weaker for  his  departure from official responsibility "" Summers wrote in a blog post.
"" Stan 's has been a singular career ""  he  said. ""As an MIT professor he coauthored  with  his  close friend Rudi Dornbusch  the macro textbook that defined the basics of the field for a generation. With Olivier Blanchard "" the former IMF chief economist  ""he wrote the treatise that defined the state of the art for graduate students. His lectures were models of lucid exposition and balanced judgment. My view of monetary economics was shaped by my experience auditing his class in the Fall of 1978.""
Not everyone is complimentary about the arc of  Fischer 's career. To some  he represents the kind of establishment economics that led to financial instability and income inequality in many parts of the world.
During his time at the IMF   Fischer  became the face of austerity measures gone wrong. Many of his and the IMF's recommendations for drastic spending cuts during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s have since been widely discredited as having made matters worse.
""I see  Fischer  as to a large extent the embodiment of the conventional wisdom among macroeconomists and central bankers "" said Dean Baker  the director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research  a liberal Washington think tank. "" He  also  in the pre-crisis days  was very much associated with the deregulation of finance gang  although I think  he  has developed an appreciation of the need for regulation since the crisis.""
Indeed   Fischer  has spoken out rather strongly against efforts by Trump and Republicans to unwind most of the key regulations imposed on Wall Street after the crisis with the aim of preventing a repeat performance.
""We seem to have forgotten that we had a financial crisis  which was caused by behavior in the banking and other parts of the financial system  and it did enormous damage to this economy ""  Fischer  told CNBC in April  just as the president was signing an executive order aimed at what  he  said was ""reviewing"" Dodd-Frank.
""Millions of people lost their jobs  millions of people lost their houses ""  Fischer  said. ""This was not a small-time  regular recession. This was huge  and it affected the rest of the world  and it affected  to some extent  our standing in the world as well. We should not forget that.""
Baker says  Fischer  did a good job in Israel  where  he  managed the central bank from 2005 to 2013.
"" He  pushed down the value of the shekel  giving the country a large trade surplus  which allowed it to get through the Great Recession with little damage "" Baker said.
As for US monetary policy   his  tenure did not include much action on the part of the Fed  but  Fischer  has been erroneously worried about the threat of looming inflation since the start of  his  tenure.

The bizarre case â with many of the most sensational details initially released by  her  husband in an exclusive interview with ABC â has baffled police and set social media buzzing.

 Papini  disappeared Nov. 2 while jogging near  her  home in Shasta County  about 215 miles north of San Francisco.
 Her  husband found  her  phone and earphones near their home after  she  failed to pick up their children at daycare and called police. He was initially a suspect  but the sheriff said Wednesday that the husband passed a lie detector test and offered to take another.
Authorities also said a Detroit man Papini texted and planned to meet shortly before  her disappearance  has been cleared of involvement.
 Papini  was found alongside Interstate 5 in Yolo County  about 100 miles from  her  home.  Her  nose was broken and  she  was wearing a chain restraint around  her  waist.  Her  blonde hair had been cut to shoulder length and  she  had a ""brand"" burned into  her  right shoulder.
Investigators declined to discuss the ""brand"" in detail.  Papini  has said  she  was not sexually assaulted and has described  her  abductors as two women who took  her  at gunpoint.
Sheriff's Sgt. Brian Jackson said the sketches drawn by FBI artists are being released 10 months after  her disappearance  because of  Papini 's difficulty in recalling what  her  abductors looked like.

input: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Big banks keen to see bottom-line benefits from U.S. President Donald Trumpâs pledge to cut red tape are pinning their hopes primarily on  Randal Quarles   the new head of bank supervision at the Federal Reserve.
FILE PHOTO: U.S. Treasury Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Randal Quarles speaks during a Reuters sponsored panel discussion on the future of the U.S. housing foundations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in New York  July 19  2006. REUTERS/Keith Bedford/File Photo
 Quarles   a former Wall Street lawyer and private equity investor nominated to the Fed by Trump last summer and sworn in this month  will have the most influence in such efforts due to the central bankâs extensive financial oversight powers.
âNormally  when you get a new governor at the Fed  you donât see anything for a few months â said Wayne Abernathy  executive vice president at the American Bankers Association and a former colleague of  Quarles  at the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush.
âI think the expectations for  Quarles  are higher  because there was so much fanfare about the position.  He âs going to feel some kind of pressure to show something.â
With  Quarles  on board  banks and analysts expect the Fed to ease aspects of everyday examination and supervision  in particular reducing the number of post-inspection notices demanding fixes to technical compliance issues  ranging from sales practices to outsourcing contracts.
The Fedâs annual stress tests analyzing how a bank would cope with market shocks - known as CCAR - are another key area where  Quarles  is likely to quickly make  his  mark.
âNow that  Randal Quarles  is in place  what we expect is that in fairly short order there will be some modifications to the way the CCAR works  because that is something that can largely be done at the behest of supervision â Guy Moszkowski  managing partner at financial analyst firm Autonomous Research  told a conference on Tuesday.
Still  those who know  Quarles  believe  he  is well-suited in terms of experience and personality to navigate the Fedâs halls of power. They point to  his  success in helping to negotiate trade deals during  his  time at the Treasury.
â He  isnât the kind of person that bows to consensus â said the ABAâs Abernathy. â He âs the type of person who makes consensus.â

BuzzFeed News reporters in the US and Europe have been investigating various alleged facts in the dossier but have not verified or falsified them. CNN reported Tuesday that a two-page synopsis of the report was given to President Obama and  Trump .
The document was prepared for political opponents of  Trump  by a person who is understood to be a former British intelligence agent. It is not just unconfirmed: It includes some clear errors. The report misspells the name of one company  ""Alpha Group "" throughout. It is Alfa Group. The report says the settlement of Barvikha  outside Moscow  is ""reserved for the residences of the top leadership and their close associates."" It is not reserved for anyone  and it is also populated by the very wealthy.
The  Trump  administration's transition team did not immediately respond to BuzzFeed News' request for comment. However  the president-elect's attorney  Michael Cohen  told Mic that the allegations were absolutely false.
And  Trump  shot back against the reports a short time later on Twitter.

input: What is known for sure about  American military scientist Frank Olson  is that on November 28  1953  the bacteriologist and father of three plunged to  his  death from the thirteenth floor of the Statler hotel in New York City  not long after  he  was secretly drugged with LSD on the orders of  his  CIA superior. Whether  Olson  was pushed  or jumped  or was nudged into committing suicide remains unclear. But indeterminacy with a generous side of conspiracy is catnip to director Errol Morris  who has made either a 241-minute film or a six-part television series depending on where and how you plan to watch it  about the tragedy's long reach into  Olson 's family and America's secretive political culture.
 Olson 's death  and the murk surrounding its cause  cast a defining shadow over the life of his son Eric  whose endless quest to find out what happened that night has pre-empted all other endeavors. The blight spread around his family. His mother became an alcoholic with  the film implies  the active encouragement of one of her husband's colleagues. But Eric  now in his sixties  has arguably been completely derailed by the tragedy. He is the central focus of Wormwood  a hybrid blend of documentary and Cold War thriller that makes The B-Side  Morris's loving portrait of radical photographer Elsa Dorfman earlier this year  look almost straightforward.
Moving back and forth between the 1953 events and 1975  when a Rockefeller commission confirmed that an army scientist had been purposefully drugged with hallucinogens   Wormwood carries us from secret meetings at Deer Lake through the long tail of misery and obfuscation left by  Frank 's death  to Eric's pursuit of the truth all the way to the corridors of power.
In hushed and menacing re-enactments  Peter Sarsgaard  whose mild manner lends itself to all kinds of tonal nuance  charts the decline and fall of  Olson   a patriotic team player whose growing unease about his agency's secretive involvement in biological warfare overseas first worries his boss (a reptilian Tim Blake Nelson) and then moves him to seize the day and use his hapless employee as a guinea pig. By the time  Frank  arrives at the hotel flanked by ambiguously supportive colleagues  he's rapidly unraveling into a gibbering wreck.
Wormwood's breathless  hopped-up style harks back to Morris's 1988 The Thin Blue Line  which called into question a murder verdict and resulted in the release of a wrongly convicted suspect from Death Row. Here the noir markers are writ so large as to verge now and then on self-parody. Morris keeps returning the action to the hotel to act out different angles and competing versions of what happened to  Olson  that night. The hypothetical range between possible perps â  Frank 's boss  his friends  two wordless thugs in fedoras  a CIA allergist played by a sinister Bob Balaban â is narrow enough to make these scenes a touch repetitive if you're watching in one sitting. Certainly they underscore Morris's standing as a lifelong participant observer of American paranoia. For which  it must be said  there is undeniable fodder in the manner of Olsen's going  the secrecy surrounding his death  the ambivalent admissions the Rockefeller Commission along with a dwindling financial settlement that looks suspiciously like hush money to  Olson  and to Morris  and the merrily chuckling presence in old footage of two well-known knowns  Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney.
For all the formal beauty of the re-enactments  the most compelling scenes in Wormwood are the unembellished interviews that Morris â ordinarily an off-screen interlocutor with an appetite for the subtly leading question â is seen conducting across a table with Eric Olson  who waves his arms around with the befuddled intensity of a superannuated schoolboy as he tells his story. Articulate and charming  Eric is a talented collage artist who seems to have sacrificed career and significant relationships to his endless search for justice and truth  even after the case was officially closed and after he contacts investigative reporter Seymour Hersh  who first reported the drugging of  Olson  in The New York Times. Grandiose as always  Hersh insists that  he knows who murdered Frank Olson   but won't say for fear of compromising an anonymous source. We can't tell whether  he 's fibbing either.
A romantic view â and I wouldn't entirely put this past Morris â is that  Olson  is  like  his  interlocutor  an artist with a magnificent obsession that sustains  him  even when it's doomed to failure. But in Wormwood  he  emerges with enormous poignancy as a tragic figure  perpetually stuck in limbo like the father we see tumbling  over and over  to  his  fate.

input: This past Thursday  a new study conducted  Tom K. Wong   a political scientist at the University of California-San Diego  found that there are broad benefits for local jurisdictions that resist cooperating with federal immigration enforcement â they are safer in the aggregate and enjoy stronger economies. ""For the first time we're kind of seeing that crime rates are lower when localities stay out of the business of federal immigration enforcement  "" Wong  said.
 He  looked at federal data on immigration detainers  an ICE-initiated 48-hour hold on anyone identified as being in the country illegally. When someone is arrested and detained in a local jail  their fingerprints are cross-referenced with a federal database of undocumented immigrants. If the fingerprints match those of someone known to be in the country illegally  ICE can ask local law enforcement to hold that person as federal officials decide whether to start the deportation process. (There have been court battles over whether holding people for days without actual charges with these federal immigration detainer requests is in violation of the Constitution.)
 Wong  compared the the data from thousands of counties  those that ICE said did not honor detainer requests and those that did. ""We don't have to make up a definition of what a sanctuary locality is ""  Wong  said. ""We have ICE telling us what it thinks a sanctuary county is.""
On average  counties that did not comply with ICE requests experienced 35.5 fewer crimes per 10 000 people than those that did.  Wong  also found that counties that did not comply with detainer requests had higher household incomes  lower rates of unemployment  lower rates of poverty  and were less likely to have children under 18 in households receiving public benefits.
The crime numbers did not surprise  Wong . Research has shown that working with federal immigration enforcement made it harder for local police agencies to investigate crimes because witnesses and victims who were in the country illegally would be less likely to come forward if they thought they risked being detained and deported. It could be that sanctuary counties have immigrant populations who are more integrated into their social fabric and economies   he  said.
The research also revealed that smaller  more rural counties experienced the most significant impact from sanctuary policies on their crime rates (lower) and economies (stronger). Taken together   Wong  said  the net benefits to sanctuary cities would offset the impact of Trump's shame offensive on them. ""The ultimate effect is going to be minimal ""  he  said.

input: If Freeney cannot play Sunday  Robert Mathis  who usually plays on the left side of the defensive line  would probably move to the right  and Raheem Brock would assume Mathis's spot. Freeney had 13 1/2 sacks this season  and he and Mathis combined for 23 of the Colts' 34.
 The sports injury expert Will Carroll said that the standard definition of Freeney's injury  which has been described by the team as a Grade 3 sprain  meant that one of the ligaments in his right ankle was at least 50 percent torn. If this were the regular season  Freeney would probably miss several weeks  perhaps as many as eight.
 Freeney's game is predicated on speed  and he often employs a spin move to shed offensive linemen. The ankle may limit his ability to spin  if he can play at all.
 Freeney has been in Florida since Friday receiving treatment  and he is known as a fast healer. This season  he sustained what was described at the time as a torn quadriceps  which was expected to keep him out for up to a month. Seven days later  Freeney played.
 ""Dwight has Wolverine type of characteristics "" linebacker Gary Brackett said. ""All year  he's had strange things. Out 10 weeks  he's back in seven days. Dwight is doing everything he can to get back to this game. In my opinion  Dwight will be ready to go.""

 The Colts  who are usually secretive about injuries  have been unusually forthcoming about the specifics of Freeney's injury  but he was not available Monday night when the news media had limited access to the team. The Colts are scheduled to be at media day on Tuesday  but it is unclear if Freeney will be there. He is unlikely to participate when the Colts begin practice here Wednesday.

 Freeney's injury is a huge break for the New Orleans Saints  who at times struggled to protect quarterback Drew Brees. They would be less likely to leave a running back or tight end in to help left tackle Jermon Bushrod  freeing them to run pass routes.
 The Colts are 9-3 when Freeney has been out of the lineup.

Now complete the following example-
input: At one point during the two-hour premiere of Citizen Rose  her new E! docuseries   Rose McGowan  describes  her  life as âtrauma on top of trauma on top of trauma.â The series  which delves deep into McGowanâs upbringing in a cult and  her  Hollywood sex symbol status  as well as  her  alleged sexual assault and its aftermath  is far more substantial and devastating than standard E! programming.
Citizen Rose takes on a portion of one of the biggest news stories of 2017: the outing of Harvey Weinstein as an alleged serial rapist and sexual abuser. Weinstein  whose name and face is obscured in McGowanâs series  is one of the many characters on Citizen Rose who has become a household name. And while the series takes pains not to amplify Weinsteinâs infamy  it gives over its platforms to some of the heroes of the Weinstein saga. Ronan Farrow  the journalist who helped expose Weinstein with his New Yorker reporting  appears on Citizen Rose to thank  McGowan  for coming forward. Itâs one of the many moments in the series that successfully brings audiences behind the scenes of crucial moments in the #MeToo timeline. We learn that  McGowan  was one of the first women to talk to Farrow  as  he  recalls  âWhen I first talked to youâ¦at the end of that interview  when I said  are there others  and you said  âI know there are others â I then went out and started calling women.â
Farrow goes on to compare Weinsteinâs decades of alleged abuse and network of spies to a detective novel  and  McGowan  explains the intense loneliness of being called crazy and paranoid for years because nobody believed that the producer was actively attempting to intimidate and silence her. After âtwenty years  with everyone saying âyouâre not seeing what youâre seeing ââ Farrowâs reporting finally  publicly confirmed what she had been privately alleging in the years since she was assaulted. She concludes  âIâm not paranoid  itâs reality.â
For  McGowan   doubts about how her narrative is being consumed are clearly secondary to the joy of being heard after decades of deafening silence. If thereâs one defining emotion in Citizen Roseâa series thatâs really about emotional as they comeâitâs relief. After years and years of being either ignored or misunderstood   McGowan  is finally being validated and encouraged to share  her  truth  as  she  sees it. The resulting two hours of truth-telling is probably more sincere than anything E! has ever aired. Itâs almost as if the network canât come to terms with the fact that they have a truly gripping  meaningful  timely subject on their hands  leading them to resort to unnecessary filler materialâinexplicable interludes of interpretive dancing and bright flashing lights.
Still  when  McGowan  speaks  itâs well worth the wait. While  she  insists that  she  has been attempting to tell  her  story for years  itâs only in recent months that  McGowan  has become legible. Before   she  was alternatively seen as a sex symbol or a loose cannon; narratives that  McGowan  convincingly argues were forced upon  her . Citizen Rose is as much about the âopen secretâ of Harvey Weinsteinâs serial sexual abuse as it is about the way that women in Hollywood are deliberately seen but not heard.
Early on in the episode  we go through the timeline of McGowanâs assault.  She  explains that  âWhen it happened to me I was in the middle of my second movie for him. I had a 10 a.m. meeting in the restaurant. The maÃ®tre dâ said heâs not ready yet  they want you to go up to his officeâ¦I get up there  two male assistants come outâ¦I had an MTV crew following me that morning  it was supposed to be  Rose McGowan   a day in the life. I turn to the cameras right when I was about to go into the hotel  and I say  âI think my life is finally getting easier.ââ
In a larger conversation about sexual-assault survivors  itâs important to point out that  McGowan   a famous white actress  comes from a place of immense privilege. Still  the history that she recalls is a painful one  from a childhood spent in the Children of God cult to what she calls âthe cult of Hollywood.â McGowan went from being a young star with all of the opportunities in the world to an assault survivor working on a movie for her alleged rapist. Over decades  just trying to do her job  she was consistently forced to interact with Weinstein  and made to remember that he was the one in power. McGowan describes turning on the TV âto see Gwyneth Paltrow giving him humanitarian awards â or going to the movies and seeing his name. âI saw him all the time â she breaks down to her mom in one scene. âI didnât get to be me for 17 yearsâ¦youâre literally trapped in the tiniest town in the world.â

 Schmidt's selection comes more than 10 months after Obama declared cyber security a priority and ordered a broad administration review.
 A senior White House official said Obama was personally involved in the selection process and chose Schmidt because of his unique background and skills. Schmidt will have regular and direct access to the president for cyber security issues  the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the selection process.
 At the same time  cyber experts and potential job candidates have complained that the position lacks the budgetary and policy-making authority needed to be successful. Schmidt will report to the National Security Council and closely support the National Economic Council on cyber issues.
 Schmidt's selection suggests that economic and business interests in the White House held more sway in the selection process.

input: Mario Casciaro  who was sent to prison for 26 years for the murder of his teenage co-worker  only to be freed after the conviction was reversed   is now seeking millions of dollars in damages from those who brought the case against  him .
It took two trials before  Casciaro  was convicted in 2013 of the unusual murder by intimidation charge in the presumed killing of 17-year-old Brian Carrick. In what had been â and now remains â one of McHenry County's most mysterious cases  Carrick disappeared in 2002 after being seen at the Johnsburg grocery store where he and Casciaro both worked. His body has never been found.
Authorities contended that Carrick was selling pot for  Casciaro  and owed him money.
A third co-worker  Shane Lamb  testified at both trials that  Casciaro  told him to ""talk"" to Carrick about the debt. Lamb said he confronted Carrick inside a produce cooler at the grocery store and punched him  knocking him unconscious. Lamb testified that  Casciaro  told him to leave the store and that he would take care of the body. Authorities said Carrick's blood was found in and around the cooler  but  Casciaro  has denied having any involvement.
Lamb  facing a lengthy sentence in an unrelated drug case  agreed to testify against  Casciaro  in exchange for immunity in Carrick's death.
 Casciaro   now 33  was released from prison in 2015 after an appellate court ruled that the state's case was improbable and Lamb's testimony did not match the physical evidence found at the scene.

input: Jameis Winston  won the Heisman Trophy the following year while leading the Seminoles to the national championship.
After one more season   he  was off to the NFL as the first pick in the draft by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The success was hardly a surprise  born out of an innate self-assurance.
"" He  always wanted to race.  He  thought  he  was the fastest person on the team  knowing  he  was the slowest.  He  was competing in everything  thought  he  had the best hands  thought  he  could cover anyone "" said Rhodes  who'll be defending  Winston  on Sunday with the Minnesota Vikings. ""I'm like  'Bro  you're just an all-around athlete  huh? Running a 4.8  huh?'""
No  speed is not part of  Winston 's elite skillset.  His  official 40-yard dash time at the NFL combine in 2015 was 4.97 seconds .
Just about everything else is. With the Vikings uncertain this week about quarterback Sam Bradford's status  having started Case Keenum at Pittsburgh because of an injury to Bradford's left knee  the Buccaneers are clearly  Winston 's team.
""Jameis is Jameis "" Rhodes said. "" He 's confident in everything  he  does.""
 Winston  will face an accomplished defense in Minnesota  with the Pro Bowl cornerback Rhodes one of the standouts.
"" His  size and speed combination is amazing. But at the end of the day  just like at Florida State  we're going to go out there and compete ""  Winston  said.
Vikings running back Dalvin Cook  a freshman in  Winston 's final season with the Seminoles in 2014  recalled a certain read-option play where  Winston  would hand  him  the ball and then try to hustle in front to block for  him .
"" He 's just a guy who built up confidence.  He  carries  himself  like a leader  which  he  is "" Cook said.

Worries over organized crime and Bulgariaâs relative poverty have stood in its way.

That will not in itself overcome resistance from wary member states.  Borissov âs finance minister said frustration had grown to such an extent that he was ready to call their bluff and apply for the next step toward the euro zone in order to force them to publicly explain their objections.
Warm words from the visitors from Brussels did not drown out opposition at home to the government.  Borissov  dismissed out of hand accusations of shrinking media freedom and  his  minister in charge of the EU presidency denounced a website run by critical journalists covering the issue as âhate speechâ and âfake newsâ.

Now complete the following example-
input: Ben McAdoo  clearly is going to go down swinging.
âUntil I had all the information  I was going to err on the high side of trusting the player  protecting the player â  McAdoo  said Wednesday.
Giants generally agree with  Ben McAdoo  suspending Janoris Jenkins
McAdoo  however  canât be so removed from reality not to understand that there was a better way to handle that situation than lying that Jenkins was âexcused for personal reasons â when he in fact hadnât even spoken with the man. And  McAdoo  also has to understand that when he stands there on Wednesday and makes no apology for his premeditated mistake  it is implicit that he most certainly would do it again.
Of course   McAdoo  hopes  he  wonât have to repeat this song and dance  but then again   he  admitted suspending two players in three weeks was ânot something that going into the season Iâd ever thought Iâd have to do â so who knows? Bad things usually hit in threes  anyway  right?
And  McAdoo  alluded to the fact that  he  is still not confident  he  controls the narrative of  his  team  as much as  he  desperately tries. When asked if  he  would discipline Eli Apple and Paul Perkins â who also missed Mondayâs practice due to travel reasons but had called  unlike Jenkins  to alert the coach â  McAdoo  answered:

Sure enough  Apple later was asked if  he  was being disciplined and said: âSomething like that.â
Now  say this for McAdooâs indefinite suspension of Jenkins  which defensive captain Jonathan Casillas said is expected to only last one week: Whatever Jenkins did to earn it  it was bad enough that not a single Giants teammate came anywhere close to defending  him  on Wednesday.
Some actually went as far as using Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie  suspended in Week 6 for walking out of the facility  as an example of a much less severe transgression than whatever Jenkins did. Casillas actually said âhopefully thereâs no spill-over in emotions coming from (Jenkins) or Coach  McAdoo  next weekâ when the corner returns  so it sounds like there could have been a heated confrontation or exchange  even if by phone.
Strong safety Landon Collins defended  McAdoo  and flat-out said the head coach hasnât lost the team and agreed with the coachâs comment that DRC and Jenkins are âisolated incidents.â
âWe have not lost respect for him â Collins said of  McAdoo . âWe continue growing with him and trying to be a great team and stay(ing) together  because our back is against the wall right now. We canât fight against each other. If we fight against each other  things are definitely going to go bad.â
âWhether I support  Ben McAdoo  or not  heâs the head coach and I think heâs doing what he thinks is best for the team â Casillas said. âAnd I want Jackrabbit to be here  everybody does  but he violated the team rule and coach had the call.â
 McAdoo  continued to find ways on Wednesday  though  to confound with contradictory or unintelligible rationalizations  including  his  argument for why  he  feels  he  hasnât lost the defensive backs room: âWe had a good day of practice â  he  said.

input: India Landry  a 17-year-old Windfern High School student  said she was suddenly expelled Oct. 2 by the schoolâs principal   Martha Strother   after  she  refused to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance. Although India said she hasnât stood for the pledge for years  it wasnât until she was in the administrative office during the daily pledge recitation that  Strother  noticed and took issue with her silent protest.
âThe principal said  âStand up or youâre out of here 'â she added  alleging  Strother  told  her  if  she  didnât leave the school grounds within five minutes   she  would call campus police and have India Landry removed.  Her  mother  Kizzy Landry  was called to come pick her up  without any further details given to her.
âThey just assumed it was about race â  she  told the Houston Chronicle. âThe assistant principal told  her   âAll the other African-Americans are standing  so you should stand  too.'â
According to KHOU  Kizzy Landry finally spoke with  Strother  in a recorded phone call  and  Strother  told  her  unequivocally that India would not be allowed to come back unless  she  stood for the pledge  even though Cy-Fair ISDâs policy is to allow students to sit during the pledge as long as they provide written permission from their parents to do so.
After a weeklong expulsion and a local news story that brought attention to the matter  the school lifted the expulsion and allowed India back to school with a note from  her  mother  but the Landry family and their attorney believe the damage is already done and are seeking an undisclosed amount in damages for mental anguish.
â She  was damaged. You canât just throw people out of school â said the familyâs attorney  Randall Kallinen. âI donât know yet if  she âll be held back.â

Wasnât this Hitlerâs dream too? A country with a master race of white people?

Tragic truth: In one year  Donald J. Trump alone  has turned the White House into a sinkhole of ignorance  bigotry and hatred against anyone who isnât a white man in a suit. True   he  used to welcome Steve Bannon  who showed up looking like an out-of-work gym teacher  but thatâs because  he  thought Bannon had his back. Ooops.
OK  Iâm not being fair.  The Donald  does allow people of color to show up on occasion  and  he  did appoint brain surgeon Ben Carson as HUD secretary even though  his  qualifications for housing secretary are that  he  lives in a house.

Nearly 200 others who once walked the halls of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School flooded the restaurant Tuesday evening in the Georgetown area of Washington  D.C. to raise money and support students and faculty at the school.

input: Osman Aslam  has tried the apps.
On Minder   he  wrote  he  enjoys hiking  going on long drives and spending time with  his  family. On Muzmatch  another option for Muslim singles   he  described  his  ideal partner as well-educated  ambitious and funny.
So on a recent winter day  armed with a pale purple dress shirt and purple tie   he  flew 300 miles south from  his  home in Stockton  Calif.  rented a car and booked a hotel room.
 Osman Aslam  at  his  workplace in Stockton  Calif. (Brian Flaherty/For The Washington Post)
Because practicing Muslims typically shun dating or sex before marriage  the banquets offer a possible  if imperfect  solution to what young Muslims in America say is an irksome problem: âItâs really hard to meet someone in this culture â  Osman  said.
 Osman Aslam  at  his  workplace in Stockton  Calif. (Brian Flaherty/For The Washington Post)
âI keep telling  her  to get marriedâ
In  Osman âs view   his  parents are an example of the kind of couple that âjust grew to love each other.â
But even though they have lasted â raising three boys in northern California and climbing from the bottom rungs of the economic ladder into middle class prosperity â theirs is not the marriage  Osman  wants.
 Osman  wants to fall in love.  He  wants to marry  his  best friend.  He  wants that person to be a Muslim and a Pakistani American â but not a Pakistani.  He  wants someone like  him  who was born and raised in the United States to immigrant parents  someone who is âon the same page.â
Three-quarters of American Muslims are immigrants or the children of immigrants  and in many ways  Osman  is emblematic of an American minority at a generational crossroads.
 Osman  considers  himself  âfairly religious.â  He  does not drink or smoke;  he  does not date â  he  âwouldnât know where to begin â  he  says; and  he  sees Islam as central to  his  life and identity.  He  has never really known  his  parentsâ Pakistan  but  he  values  his  heritage and shares their desire to carry it on.
 Osman âs parents think  he  is too picky  and they have been laying on the pressure since  his  older brothers got married.
 He  felt optimistic about this matrimonial banquet.
âWow â  he  thought  surveying the room. âIâm going to meet a lot of people.â
The other singles had come from all over: California  Maryland  Texas and Canada. Each pairing had three minutes to talk â barely enough time to accomplish anything   Osman  soon realized â but many had come carrying the same frustrations about the search.

 Schmidt's selection comes more than 10 months after Obama declared cyber security a priority and ordered a broad administration review.
 A senior White House official said Obama was personally involved in the selection process and chose Schmidt because of his unique background and skills. Schmidt will have regular and direct access to the president for cyber security issues  the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the selection process.
 At the same time  cyber experts and potential job candidates have complained that the position lacks the budgetary and policy-making authority needed to be successful. Schmidt will report to the National Security Council and closely support the National Economic Council on cyber issues.
 Schmidt's selection suggests that economic and business interests in the White House held more sway in the selection process. Schmidt  president and CEO of the Information Security Forum  a nonprofit international consortium that conducts research in information security  has served as chief security officer for Microsoft and as cyber security chief for online auction giant eBay. He was reportedly preferred by Lawrence Summers  director of the economic council. A good format for the titel can be the simple subject + object + verb.

 ""Around 85 to 90 percent of our (environmental) concerns have been addressed. The process of building the Navi Mumbai airport can start today. With these compromises we are fully on board and will ensure speedy work "" Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh told the media here.
 The Navi Mumbai airport  which has been planned some 30 kilometers away from the current Chattrapati Shivaji airport in Mumbai  had been a contentious issue because of its environmental impact due to its location. But  the Indian Environment Ministry finally cleared the project.
 Claiming that the plans for the airport have been modified so that one river instead of two will be diverted  the minister said: ""River Gadhi would not be diverted to make way for the airport and added that 161 hectares of mangroves would fall under Navi Mumbai airport.""

input: Ali Bongo will be sworn in as Gabon's president this week  succeeding his late father  after a top court upheld his victory in hotly disputed presidential polls.
 The oil- and timber-rich West African nation's Constitutional Court confirmed Bongo won the election prompted by the death of his father Omar Bongo Ondimba  who had ruled the country for 41 years.
 Chief Justice Marie Madeleine Mborantsuo confirmed Bongo as the poll winner with 41.79 percent of the ballot.
 Interim president Rose Francine Rogombe will formally hand over power to Bongo as part of the ceremony at the presidential palace in Libreville. The organisers have also planned a military parade and fireworks display.
 But the secretary general of Ali Bongo's Gabonese Democratic Party  Faustin Boukoubi  said he had ""a feeling of full satisfaction.""
 ""Right and the law have prevailed "" he said. ""All Gabonese have a president who will get down to all the problems of the Gabonese people and make Gabon into an emerging country.""
 If reaction to the court's ruling passes without incident  Ali Bongo still faces a difficult start to his presidency  observers say.
 However  according to an official of Mamboundou's UPG (Union of Gabonese People) party  the country's ethnic mix will severely test Bongo's ability to win consensus.
 ""No-one is prepared to negotiate with him "" said the official. Bongo  who comes from a minority ethnic group ""will have lined up against him the Fang  the Punu  and Nzebis. The country is going to be ungovernable.""

input: The speculation about President Donald Trump's mental status is ""very dangerous "" and the 25th Amendment was not made to be invoked when parties don't agree about a president's ""emotional makeup  "" Harvard Law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz  said Monday.
""I have railed against the criminalization of political difference  "" Dershowitz  told Fox News' ""Fox & Friends"" program.
Yale Professor Bandy Lee earlier this month briefed several congressional Democrats and one Republican earlier this month over her concerns over the president's mental state  and  Dershowitz  said her comments that  he  is dangerous and may need to be restrained from action are in themselves dangerous.
""Imagine how dangerous that would be  and you know  psychiatrists are notoriously bad at predicting violence "" said  Dershowitz .
""Remember  what they are looking at are things they knew about since he was elected president ""  Dershowitz  added. ""I didn't like what I saw necessarily so I did what you do in a democracy  you vote for the candidate you prefer  I preferred Hillary Clinton. I knew about her  I knew about him. I made a balanced judgment. You don't lock them up. You don't put them in mental hospitals if you don't agree with them. So dangerous to democracy.""
""[It] is designed for when somebody has a stroke or somebody is unconscious  perhaps what happened when President [Woodrow] Wilson was president "" said  Dershowitz . ""He had a serious stroke. It's not designed for differences about a person's emotional makeup.""
In addition   Dershowitz  said that politically  the 25th Amendment likely would not be invoked as the vice president would have to do that  and if the president disputed the matter  then it would have to be voted for by two thirds of both houses of congress.
""It would happen only if any president  I'm not talking about a particular one  had a major psychotic break "" said  Dershowitz . ""Look  we once had a secretary of defense his name is [James] Forrestal  he jumped out of the window of the Walter Reed Center. He thought the communists were coming after him.""
""Oh  by the way  one of the things [Lee] talks about that's a symptom of his mental illness is that he recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel "" said  Dershowitz . ""So did the majority of the Senate and majority of the House and so did I support that. Am I getting locked up next?""
 Dershowitz  on Monday also talked about the importance of allowing dissent on college campuses.
The way to solve the issue is to fight back   Dershowitz  added  while blaming college administrators for the unrest.

input: Sirleaf  70  acknowledged before the commission in February that she gave up to $10 000 to a rebel group headed by Charles Taylor. Sirleaf said the money she sent while an expatriate was meant for humanitarian services and that she was never a member of the group  the National Patriotic Front.
 Information Minister Laurence Bropleh said Monday evening if the public had had any dissatisfaction with Sirleaf's involvement with Taylor at the time  they would have voted against her in 2005.
 In 2005 the Liberian people knew that President Sirleaf had contributed $10 000 to Taylor's movement  Bropleh said.
 An AP correspondent and others who covered the Liberian war can recall no humanitarian works by Taylor and his fighters  especially in the first months of the war when tens of thousands of refugees were fleeing across the borders to Ivory Coast and Guinea  where they were helped by international and government agencies.
 Then  most atrocities were committed by Doe's forces and Taylor was welcomed as a liberator fighting a barbaric dictatorship.
 ""In defense of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf  she never hid the fact that she was curious about Taylor and what he was all about "" said Huband  who drove with Johnson Sirleaf on her first trip to meet Taylor in May 1990. ""A lot of people supported the idea of Doe being ousted and there had been so many attempts  and they all were foiled  at least one with the help of the American government  which continued to support Doe despite his brutality.""
 ""I never had the impression that Sirleaf supported Taylor  certainly not after it became clear his troops were out of control "" Huband said. ""Certainly there was no way she could predict the kind of atrocities that would be committed (by Taylor's fighters) ...""

input: Over at Lawfareblog  theyâve gotten a hold of a cache of e-mails from inside the FBI from the immediate aftermath of the president*âs firing of director James Comey. These are significant in a couple of ways: first  the release of these e-mails can fairly be seen as a counterstroke against the president* and his congressional dogsled team  and second  they give a pretty good look at the kind of chaos that Comeyâs firing occasioned in the Bureauâs rank and file.
When President Trump fired  James Comey  as FBI director last May  the special agent in charge of the Detroit field office  David Gelios  wrote an email to  his  staff: â I just saw CNN reporting that  Director Comey  has been fired by President Trump. I have no notification from HQ of any such thing. If I receive any information from HQ  I will advise. Iâd ask all to stand by for clarification of this reporting. I am only sending this because I want everyone to know I have received no HQ confirmation of the reporting. I hope this is an instance of fake news.â
Oh  and the e-mails also provide further evidence that Sarah Huckabee Sanders is an utterly truthless drone whose daily briefings are unworthy of serious attention. At the time  Comey  was fired  the White House line  peddled by SarahHuck and by the vulgar talking yam for whom she works  was that agents in the Bureau had âlost confidenceâ in Comeyâs leadership. (At the time  the president*  of course  would undercut his own outrageous lie by telling Lester Holt that he canned  Comey  over the Russia thing.) These e-mails show a sense of outrage among the grunts in the field offices on whose behalf Sanders and Trump presumed to speak.
After the president fired Comey there was some uncertainty about whether Comey  as a former FBI employee  would have to pay his way home from LAX or would be able to use the directorâs plane. NBC recently reported that an irate Trump called McCabe a day after the firing asking why  Comey  had been permitted to return to Washington on an FBI plane. McCabe indicated that he hadnât been consulted about the use of the plane but  had anyone asked  he would have approved the request. Thanks to one of these emails  we now have a small window into what went on at the FBI at the time. On May 11  Gregory Cox  assistant director of the Critical Incident Response Group  emailed all of the Critical Incident Response Group thanking âall who were involved in efforts to bring home former Director Comey from Los Angeles on Tuesday evening.â The apparent defiance may be subtle  but it is unmistakable. Cox may not have known that his email dealt with a point the president had personally raised with the acting director  but he thanked his people for doing the right thing by  Comey  irrespective of politics  he  was surely aware of in a generic sense.
I donât minimize how thoroughly  Comey  bungled at the end of the 2016 presidential campaign. If what  he âs doing now is atonement  thatâs only right.  He  has a lot for which  he  should atone. But the sense of dislocation in these e-mails shows where the current propaganda war against the FBI first took root. Itâs where the water first went muddy.

 Schmidt's selection comes more than 10 months after Obama declared cyber security a priority and ordered a broad administration review.
 A senior White House official said Obama was personally involved in the selection process and chose Schmidt because of his unique background and skills.

 At the same time  cyber experts and potential job candidates have complained that the position lacks the budgetary and policy-making authority needed to be successful. Schmidt will report to the National Security Council and closely support the National Economic Council on cyber issues.
 Schmidt's selection suggests that economic and business interests in the White House held more sway in the selection process.

input: BAGHDAD -- Weeks after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in the spring of 2003  as parts of the capital were still smoldering  American soldiers and diplomats turned to men like Hassan Shama and Omar Rahman Rahmani in their quest to plant the seeds of representative democracy.
 In Baghdad  Iraq's capital  they held impromptu neighborhood caucuses to appoint district and neighborhood advisory councils. The local government bodies were given no official charter  lawmaking power or public budget. In the years that followed  as the capital became a bloody battleground and the country descended into near-anarchy  council members were among the U.S. military's staunchest allies. They provided information about extremists  offered insight into Iraqi society and gave American-imposed security measures a veneer of Iraqi legitimacy.
 ""They used to come to our meetings  and they had all the power in their hands "" Rahmani said. ""Now we don't have any power.""
 Rahmani visited the Bush White House last year as part of a delegation of local Iraqi politicians. When he got his turn to shake George W. Bush's hand  he said  he told the president that democracy in Iraq was not taking root.
 Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's government and the Baghdad provincial council  also led by Shiites  seemed uninterested in working with the local councils  Rahmani said he told Bush.
 ""Every party is working in Saddam's shadow "" Rahmani said  referring to ousted President Saddam Hussein. ""Everyone wants to be a Saddam. Everyone wants power in their own hands.""

input: Villanova guard  Mikal Bridges  reacts after blocking a shot during the second half Tuesday. (Julie Jacobson/Associated Press)
NEW YORK —  Mikal Bridges  was not even a top 80 recruit coming out of  his  suburban Philadelphia high school in 2014. In the one-and-done era of college basketball   he  was the opposite when  he  arrived at Villanova that summer and was forced to redshirt  his  freshman season because  he  simply wasn’t ready. When  he  was finally prepared to play as a relatively unknown reserve on the Wildcats’ national championship team the following season   his  older teammates chided  him  for  his  finesse tendencies in the lane.  He  preferred layups over powerful dunks.
Pray for the Gonzaga basketball team Nothings wrong with them  it’s just that  Mikal Bridges  just ended  their  program pic.twitter.com/ywUj8Hhirx — Stri:(a (@StrikaNation24_) December 6  2017
More people stood after the sequence  and a large group of fans started chanting “Mi-kal Bri-dges” briefly at one end of the arena. It ended after a few seconds  but what  Bridges  did Tuesday night — scoring a career-high 28 points to go along with six rebounds and two blocks — will likely reverberate across college basketball for some time. ESPN analyst Jay Bilas said on the game’s telecast that  Bridges  had made a “case for first-team all-American.” On Twitter  former Villanova guard Josh Hart claimed his former teammate would be a first-round pick  and some even boldly projected that  Bridges  would be drafted ahead of Michigan State star Miles Bridges.
That wave of noise didn’t seem to faze the soft-spoken Mikal Bridges as he took the podium afterward  where he said all the right things and told the story about the older veterans in the program who have challenged him to attack more over the years. One of the primary concerns for Villanova entering the season was finding a replacement for the graduated Hart and Kris Jenkins  who were pillars in the program for four seasons. Villanova has another experienced star in 6-2 junior point guard Jalen Brunson  who finished with 12 points Tuesday  as well as redshirt junior Phil Booth  a Baltimore product who scored 20 points on 9-for-14 shooting as Gonzaga turned in one of its worst defensive performances of the past two years.

input: It's been estimated that  American actress Meghan Markle’s  wedding to Prince Harry  scheduled next May 19  will translate into a £500 million boost for the British economy .
The ""Meghan Effect"" may give her soon-to-be sister-in-law a run for her money. Fortune magazine predicts that ""Meghan Markle's 'Midas Touch' Could Match Duchess Kate's.""
According to the New York Times: “There is a blog —  Meghan ’s Mirror — that chronicles  her  every style choice. Vogue has a piece online titled “ Meghan Markle’s  Stealth Shopping Style Is All the Black Friday Inspo You Need ” while InStyle crowed “The Nordstrom Black Friday Sale Has Discounts on  Meghan Markle’s  Favorite Denim Brand.”
Fashion Editor Vanessa Friedman of the New York Times saw  Markle ’s choice of dress as a reflection of the ""completely different kind of royal""  she  will be and  her  opportunity to further modernize the monarchy.
“ She  is perfectly aware that everything  she  wears is going to be under the social media spotlight  so  she  might as well make it work for  her  ” Friedman writes. “Even the smallest gestures are going to have a heightened import as the royal family adjusts to a modern identity. Far beyond Britain and the formal royal watchers  many have a special investment in this particular story and how it gets told.”
""Harry and  Meghan  should not be lulled into a false sense of security "" Sykes warns. ""There is already a significant undercurrent of hostility to  Meghan  circulating in some sections of the British establishment. Blame the blinding glare of new love if you will  but Harry and  Meghan  seem to be  if not heading for the rocks  at least grazing the odd sandbank.""
As photos and video clips of  her  most recent public appearances as the prince’s fiancé show   she 's already a main focus of attention for photographers and cameramen. Such was the case during the spectacle of the royal family's annual Christmas parade between Sandringham estate  the queen’s private residence  and the nearby St Magdalene Church  for their traditional service.
After Harry and  Meghan  went to Monte Carlo to celebrate the new year with friends  the comparisons with Grace Kelly  the Hollywood star who married Prince Rainier of Monaco to become the admired Prince Grace  were all over the media.
 She  also was compared to Princess Charlene  the South African former Olympic swimmer who married Monaco's Prince Albert II.
It's rumored that Meghan and Kate have a good understanding -  Markle  and Harry stayed with the Cambridges  who have a house in the Sandringham estate during the Christmas celebrations - and royal experts assume that Kate will help guide  Meghan  through the royal paces.
Despite  her  current popularity and seeming ease facing the challenges of royal life   Markle  will need all the support  she  can get.
“After all  the 36-year-old is set for a daunting transition ” the Telegraph predicts. “When  she  marries Prince Harry  Meghan will be trading an acting career and a life of relative freedom for one of public duty  reserve and near-ceaseless waving – and that’s notwithstanding the private pressures of remembering if and when to curtsy to her in-laws.”
