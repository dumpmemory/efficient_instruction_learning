input: In a letter posted on the White House web site Tuesday  John Brennan  assistant to President Barack Obama for homeland security and counterterrorism  said Schmidt will have regular access to the president and play a vital role in the country's security.
 Schmidt's selection comes more than 10 months after Obama declared cyber security a priority and ordered a broad administration review.
 A senior White House official said Obama was personally involved in the selection process and chose Schmidt because of his unique background and skills. Schmidt will have regular and direct access to the president for cyber security issues  the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the selection process.
 At the same time  cyber experts and potential job candidates have complained that the position lacks the budgetary and policy-making authority needed to be successful. Schmidt will report to the National Security Council and closely support the National Economic Council on cyber issues.
 Schmidt's selection suggests that economic and business interests in the White House held more sway in the selection process. Schmidt  president and CEO of the Information Security Forum  a nonprofit international consortium that conducts research in information security  has served as chief security officer for Microsoft and as cyber security chief for online auction giant eBay. He was reportedly preferred by Lawrence Summers  director of the economic council. A good format for the titel can be the simple subject + object + verb.

input: The clock has finally run out for an Upper East Side judge who ridiculed a lawyer with cerebral palsy and allowed cases involving tenants without heat or hot water to drag on   sources told The Post . The Manhattan Housing Court ’ s advisory council   which reviews its judges after each four - year term   recently ruled that jurist Susan Avery should get the boot — as it catalogued years of complaints against her   sources said . Avery ’ s chief - judge boss is now set to follow through on the recommendation by the end of the year   sources said . “ Considering the complaints against her   it ’ s about time for her to leave the bench  ” said Alan Flacks   a longtime local resident pushing for judicial reform . Avery   52   of East 84th Street   landed her $ 175   000 - a - year job in 2012 thanks to a political appointment by then - Chief Judge Gail Prudenti . But she started demonstrating poor judgment almost immediately from the bench   according to the 14 - member Advisory Council for the Housing Part of the Civil Court of New York City . In 2013   Avery reprimanded a lawyer with cerebral palsy for his sloppy handwriting   the panel said in its four - page finding   which called the judge “ unfeeling .’’ The incident resulted in a letter of caution being placed in Avery ’ s file   according to a court source . The council — comprised of representatives from both the real - estate industry and tenants ’ organizations appointed by the mayor and governor — also criticized Avery for “ excessive multi - week adjournments ” for cases involving lack of heat and hot water   said the letter   a copy of which was read to The Post . The advisory council said in its decision last month that the New York Law School grad showed a general “ lack of concern ” for the litigants before her . The council added it was “ disturbed further ” by conflicts of interests involving the Housing Court judge ’ s family real - estate holdings . A court source said  Avery  failed to disclose that a law firm administering a family trust also regularly represents landlords in cases before the judge . Meanwhile   the jurist garnered a “ not approved ” rating by the city Bar Association — twice . Voters also refused to back her two bids to move up to civil court . In the summer of 2016    a judge who was running against Avery for a civil - court position  lodged a complaint over her campaign tactics . Justice Sabrina Kraus   who was appointed to the bench in 2005   accused Avery ’ s boyfriend of making derogatory comments about her Iranian heritage on Facebook .  Avery  failed to disavow the remarks   showing ethnic bias   the advisory panel added . Kraus beat  Avery  to win the seat .  Avery  ran for civil court again this year but lost in the September primary .  Avery  did not respond to multiple requests for comment . The former chief judge who appointed her   Prudenti   said she had no memory of choosing her .

Who:  Cara  and Jesse Nuno
How much: $272 261 in five years 
Cara  and  Jesse Nuno  (Photo: NerdWallet.com)
Six years ago   Cara  and  Jesse Nuno  could not imagine a debt-free life.
 Cara : I think I had suggested [going to a credit counselor] in the past  but at the time Jess was too proud to talk to  them .
Jesse: In 2012  I can’t remember if we saw the advertisement [for the agency] on TV or not  but somehow it just kinda clicked  so we went to  them .  They  gave us April’s number.
April (credit counselor): The majority of  their  debt was old and in collections  so they were really at the “cleanup stage” and [handling each debt] one at a time more than all together. They used a mix of different techniques to address the collections. Some needed to be disputed as already paid or invalid. They also had some that appeared to be past the statute of limitations  so they first needed to verify this with an attorney and then dispute. Others they settled on  but most they made paid in full.
 Cara :  We  kept looking each month at what  we  had and the progress  we  had made. Slowly but surely  as  we  disputed and paid down  our  debts   our  credit scores went up.
 Jesse : Same for me. I was looking forward to the future where one day   we ’d be able to buy things again.
April: When  Jesse  and Cara first came to me in 2012  their credit scores were 536 and 584  respectively. As of 2016  Cara’s was 667 and  Jesse ’s was 758.
 Jesse : I seem to be sleeping better at night  not tossing and turning like I used to  figuring how I’m going to pay this or how I’m going to pay that. It takes its toll — I got the gray hair to prove it.
 Cara :  We ’d like to do some work on the house and get  our  vehicles paid off. Now  we  have a budget  and Jess pays all  our  bills early.
 Cara : It’s OK to ask for counseling to get started with a plan to get your debt paid off. Don’t be embarrassed to ask for help because you’re not the only person that’s been there.

 McHugh could not be reached for comment. His attorney  Greg Stannard  said he had not had time to review the case and could not comment.
 McHugh is under a court order to sell all his rental properties in Los Angeles by the fall of 2010 as part of a plea agreement to avoid jail time for fire and habitability violations.
 City officials have been trying to regulate McHugh for decades. In the 1980s  then-City Attorney Ira Reiner accused McHugh  now 84  of dealing in ""blood money"" and threatened to put him in jail.
 But the landlord continued to amass buildings and a record of violating health and safety codes. Last summer  his lawyer told city officials that he owned more than 140 properties  housing about 8 000 people  many of them impoverished immigrants in the city's core.
 Tenants and their advocates say the conditions in his buildings caused health risks such as lead poisoning  asthma and ear infections caused by allergy to cockroaches.

 Judge Roy Moore  speaks as  he  participates in the Mid-Alabama Republican Club's Veterans Day Program in Vestavia Hills  Alabama  U.S.  November 11  2017. REUTERS/Marvin Gentry
Trump’s position did not go as far as other Republican leaders in Washington who have said they believe the women accusing the former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice and have demanded  Moore  withdraw from the race before the Dec. 12 vote.
“The president said in his statement earlier this week that if the allegations are true  then  Roy Moore  should step aside. He still firmly believes that ” she said.
Asked if the president’s endorsement of  Moore  still stands  Sanders said Trump thinks Alabama voters should decide the winner of the race.
In the past week  multiple women have accused  Moore  of sexual improprieties or unwanted romantic advances they said occurred decades ago. Some of the women were teenagers at the time  and he was in his 30s.
Before the allegations surfaced   Moore  was heavily favored to defeat Democrat Doug Jones in the special election next month.
 Moore  scored a decisive Republican primary victory in September over Luther Strange  who was appointed to fill the vacant seat after Jeff Sessions became U.S. attorney general earlier this year.
Trump backed Strange in the primary but threw his support to  Moore  after Strange’s defeat.

input: Face masks are placed on children in Antananarivo   Madagascar   on Tuesday . ( Alexander Joe / Associated Press ) Some might consider the plague a thing of the past   buried deep in medieval history . But it thrives in Madagascar   where the disease is a seasonal worry . And this year   the country is experiencing what may be its deadliest outbreak in years : About 194 people are suspected to have fallen ill from the plague since August   and 33 have died as of Saturday   according to Madagascar ’ s Ministry of Health . Experts say they can ’ t remember the last time the death toll was so high . In 2016   63 people died over the course of the year   out of 275 cases . The majority of this year ’ s cases are pneumonic plague   which can be transmitted through coughing   according to the BBC . This form of the disease can kill an infected person in less than a day . To slow the outbreak   Madagascar is temporarily shutting down its public institutions . Government authorities ordered two universities to close   and other schools have shut their doors across the country   including the capital   Antananarivo   so buildings can be sprayed with insecticides . The World Health Organization has shipped more than a million doses of antibiotics to the country   the BBC reported . “ We are scared — all of these deaths show that the situation is serious  ” Miora Herinjatovo   55   told Agence France - Presse on Wednesday . She got a mask from a hospital — unlike her husband   who failed to get one after standing in line outside a pharmacy . He instead collected a handful of generic antibiotics . [ The plague   alive and well in Madagascar ] Experts say the outbreak started in late August   when a 31 - year - old man from the eastern city of Toamasina took a trip inland to Ankazobe   where the plague lives in rodent and flea populations . While there   he came down with malaria - like symptoms . He died in a taxi home   passing through Antananarivo   the WHO said in a Sept . 28 statement . The WHO said that many of the cases identified are directly or indirectly linked to the man   which is evidence of person - to - person transmission . Of the 31 people who made direct or indirect contact with him   four became ill and died   the WHO said . Antananarivo and Toamasina were among the most - infected cities : As of Sept . 30   Antananarivo and its suburbs had 27 cases and seven deaths   and Toamasina had 18 cases and five deaths . Antananarivo has about 1 . 3 million residents   while Toamasina has about 237   000   according to a 2014 count by the National Institute of Statistics in Madagascar . Public gatherings   including jazz festivals and basketball tournaments   have been called off to prevent the plague from spreading   according to media reports . One of the people killed by the plague last week was a basketball coach from the Seychelles   who died while visiting the capital for a tournament   according to a WHO report released Thursday . “ Right now   we have the outbreak of a very infectious   fatal disease  ” said Katharina Kreppel   an epidemiologist at the Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania   who spent four years conducting field research in Madagascar . “ If people don ’ t notice fast enough   or don ’ t have access to health care fast enough   they die very quickly .” [ There ’ s plague in Arizona . Authorities warn of fleas that can infect people and pets .] This plague shares the same bacterium   yersinia pestis   that caused the “ Black Death ” pandemic in Europe during the 14th century . The most common form of the plague in Madagascar was   until this year   the bubonic plague   spread to humans through infected fleas that contracted the infection from small animals they bit   like rats . The disease is typically spread to humans by the bite of an infected flea   according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The bubonic plague is often treatable with antibiotics . If left untreated   though   the bacteria can spread through the bloodstream to the lungs and cause pneumonic plague — a deadly   more infectious form that ’ s now spreading throughout Madagascar . Symptoms of the pneumonic plague are similar to the common cold   according to the CDC . The symptoms of bubonic plague are fever   headaches   chills and weakness — as well as one or more swollen and painful lymph nodes   known as buboes . The bacteria multiply in the lymph node closest to where the bacteria entered the body   usually through the infected flea bite   according to the CDC . If an infected person isn ’ t given antibiotics   the bacteria can spread to other parts of the body . Should the bubonic plague become pneumonic   the person will develop shortness of breath   chest pain and sometimes bloody or watery mucous . The pneumonia may cause respiratory failure and shock . All forms of plague   if untreated   can progress rapidly to death   according to the CDC . There have been three major plague pandemics : The Justinian plague   which broke in the Byzantine Empire in AD 541 ; the “ Black Death  ” which originated in China in 1334 and spread to Europe ; and the Modern Plague   which began in China in the 1860s and appeared in Hong Kong by 1894   according to the CDC . It was during the last pandemic that scientists identified the link between the bacteria and infectious flea bites   and rat - associated plague was soon brought under control in most urban areas . The plague has since been controlled in most countries with insecticides   according to the CDC . And since it can be treated with antibiotics   the spread of the disease is usually prevented if promptly identified . The plague is most commonly found in sub - Saharan Africa and Madagascar   areas which account for more than 95 percent of reported cases   according to the CDC . Madagascar often sees the highest numbers of bubonic plague cases worldwide   about 600 infections annually . Madagascar has been in the throes of a political crisis since 2009 and has become one of the poorest countries in the world   with more than 92 percent of the population living on less than $ 2 a day   according to the World Bank Group . It ’ s lost a substantial portion of international aid   and its infrastructure has deteriorated . Once rice harvest season finishes at the end of summer   the rat population drops   as they don ’ t have as much food . Fleas begin looking for new hosts to bite and settle on humans . As it is an island   Madagascar is home to species that transmit the plague and often aren ’ t found anywhere else    Kreppel  told The Washington Post . While Madagascar ’ s scientists have monitored plague patterns for years and have the knowledge to mitigate the spread of this new   pneumonic plague   the money and resources to do so aren ’ t available    Kreppel  said . There isn ’ t adequate funding for insecticides   spraying equipment or antibiotics   she said   and there aren ’ t enough health facilities to house quarantined patients . The country can ’ t afford the vehicles required to travel to isolated villages   should the disease spread further    Kreppel  said . “ If an outbreak like this happened in the U . S . or Europe or anywhere else it would be controlled quite fast   because the resources are there  ” she said . This post has been updated .

Now complete the following example-
input: But  President Donald J. Trump  hardly looked like a grand wizard a week ago today. On January 8   he  hosted Alveda King  the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; Isaac Newton Farris Jr.  Dr. King’s nephew  and Bruce Levell of the National Diversity Coalition for  Trump . All three of  Trump ’s guests are black.
“I did about 200 cataract surgeries with a group of surgeons in Haiti and the same in Central America ” Senator Paul  an ophthalmologist  said on NBC’s Meet the Press yesterday. “And when we asked  Donald J. Trump  as a private citizen to support those trips   he  was a large financial backer of both medical mission trips.” Paul continued: “I think it’s unfair then to sort of all of a sudden paint him  ‘Oh well   he ’s a racist ’ when I know  for a fact  that  he  cares very deeply about the people in Haiti because  he  helped finance a trip where we were able to get vision back for 200 people in Haiti.”
Whatever  Trump  said or didn’t say  the reaction has been beyond incendiary  with the words “racist” and “racism” erupting like volcanos around the Pacific Ring of Fire.
 Trump’s  alleged language  if uttered  was unfortunate  vulgar  and unpresidential  although  he  hardly would have been the first chief executive to use profanity in office.  His  supposed words apparently were aimed at sh**hole nations  rather than sh**hole people. The latter would have been inexcusable.
It is widely understood that certain nations are garden spots  and others are not. It is fair to say that Haiti  El Salvador  and a tragically high number of African countries are non-garden spots. It also is perfectly appropriate to ask whether America would be better off with immigrants from such impoverished and embattled places or from prosperous nations  such as Norway  which  Trump  reportedly mentioned. It likely was top of mind  given Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg’s visit and joint press conference with him on Wednesday.
Whatever he stated or didn’t   President Trump  should learn these lessons from this experience  and repeat them to  himself  daily:
“Every word I say matters.” This is true in public  in private  and around the clock  until  he  leaves the White House and begins work on the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library.
 Trump  should think of  himself  as Jim Carrey in the 1998 film The Truman Show. Except when  he  is in bed   Trump  should behave as if every breath  he  takes were being broadcast live around the globe.
 Trump  needs to remember that Democrats are not  his  pals. They almost universally crave  his  failure  resist  his  program  and want to yank  him  from office — never mind the 304 votes  he  legitimately won in the Electoral College. Anything  he  says in front of Democrats (and even some Never  Trump  Republicans  alas) can and will be used against  him  in the court of public opinion.  Senator Durbin  should be condemned for publicizing (or distorting)  his  private conversation with  Trump   thus sabotaging efforts to reach a DACA deal. But this should be no more shocking than if  somewhere in Illinois  a rooster crowed at dawn.
 Trump  needs to remember that Democrats are not  his  pals.
Ned Ryun of American Majority has an excellent idea: Whenever  President Trump  meets with Democrats   he  should summon news cameras and let them stay until Democrats leave. Trump displayed his leadership skills to almost universal applause when he allowed the media to broadcast live for 55 minutes from the Cabinet Room  as he negotiated immigration and border security last Tuesday. Doing this regularly when Democrats are around will prevent them from offering journalists an alternative version of events. With cameras present  Trump should be on his best behavior. And the American people will benefit from Senate-floor-like transparency inside the White House. This would be unprecedented and gain Trump considerable respect for opening a virtual sunroof atop the West Wing.
Trump’s job is to recall at all times  with the relentlessness of a bloodhound chasing an escaped Death Row inmate  that he must not give free knives and anvils to people who hate his guts and literally would cheer if he woke up dead tomorrow morning . (And the Left need not bother to deny this. Everyone knows this is true  as evidenced by the Left’s repeated fantasies about Trump being shot  stabbed  and decapitated.) These people would call  Trump  a racist for ordering vanilla ice cream.  He  should remember this without fail and act accordingly.
If  Trump  becomes blurry about this fact   he  should remember the very first fake-news story to emerge on  his  watch. On January 20  during  his  very first day as president  Time magazine’s Zeke Miller reported that Trump removed a bust of Dr. Martin Luther King from the Oval Office. This confirmed that  Trump  was a racist who couldn’t wait to evict that troublemaking black from  his  new office.

BuzzFeed News reported that the driver had alleged  Winston  grabbed her crotch during a ride in Scottsdale  Arizona in March 2016.  Winston  has denied the allegation.
 Winston  is now being probed by the NFLâs special counsel for investigations  Lisa Friel  who had written to the quarterbackâs accuser.
âThe League has been informed that you may have been the victim of such a violation perpetrated by Tampa Bay Buccaneers player Jameis Winston â Friel wrote in the letter.
 Winston   23  issued a statement in response to the BuzzFeed report  denying the allegations.
âA news organization has published a story about me regarding an alleged incident involving a female Uber driver from approximately two years ago â  Winston  said.
 Winston  is in  his  third season with Tampa Bay after being the top pick in the 2015 draft.
 His  college career had been dogged by controversy  including a 2012 allegation of rape by a fellow student at Florida State.  Winston  did not face charges following the incident.

input: OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo  speaks to the media during  his  visit in Abuja  Nigeria Febuary 27  2017. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - OPECâs Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo on Tuesday called on U.S. shale oil producers to help curtail global oil supply  warning extraordinary measures might be needed next year to sustain the rebalanced market in the medium to long term.
âWe urge our friends  in the shale basins of North America to take this shared responsibility with all seriousness it deserves  as one of the key lessons learnt from the current unique supply-driven cycle â said  Barkindo .
âAt the moment we (OPEC and independent U.S. producers) both agreed that we have a shared responsibility in maintaining stability because they are also not insulated from the impact of this downturn â  Barkindo  said  referring to a slide in oil prices that spurred OPEC to agree production cuts late last year.
While OPEC and some other producers  including Russia have cut supplies this year in order to prop up prices  U.S. production has soared by almost 10 percent this year  driven largely by shale drillers.  Barkindo  said  he  hoped that new producers  not just U.S. shale drillers  would join production cuts.
âDemand-supply is returning to rebalance through massive destocking that we have been witnessing of stocks in OECD across regions in a very massive way â  Barkindo  said later  speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the conference.
âIn the past four months alone  we have seen destocking to the tune of 130 million bpd â  he  said.
The aim of the OPEC-led cut is to trim the level of oil in OECD industrialized countries compared with the five-year supply average.  Barkindo  said the stock overhang to the five-year average stood at 171 million barrels in August  against 338 million at the start of the year.
âThe speed and pace (of destocking) has accelerated as a result of anticipated and projected demand growth in the second half of 2017 to the tune of 2 million bpd. We are witnessing a fast return to a balanced market â  Barkindo  said.
Still  on  Sunday Barkindo  said OPEC and other oil producers might need to take âsome extraordinary measuresâ next year to rebalance the oil market.
World oil demand growth in 2017 is expected at 1.45 million barrels per day (BPD) and it should stay around 1.4 million bpd in 2018   Barkindo  said.  He  said Indiaâs share of global oil demand is expected to rise to over 9 percent by 2040  up from 4 percent now.

Now complete the following example-
input: But Gaga has spent the past three years deconstructing her previous project  which is its own kind of performance. Elaborate dance pop ceded ground to jazz standards  showtunes  and country rock. Tentacle gowns went into the closet; jeans and a pink cowboy hat came out. The director Chris Moukarbel shot Five Foot Two largely on handheld—maybe even smartphone—cameras. You see Gaga cooking  recording  planning  crying  bonding. In one scene  she’s topless as she chats with her team by the poolside. The implication: This is Gaga  au naturel. Yet she never seems to forget the camera. Five Foot Two documents last year’s release of her album Joanne  and makes clear how much Gaga’s public reboot relied on demonstrating that she  like everyone else  suffers. Gaga has increasingly mined the traumas of her own life  with songs and philanthropic efforts growing out of her rape at age 19. The dissolution of her engagement to the actor Taylor Kinney  mournfully referenced a few times in the documentary  seemed to inform the breakup-themed Joanne singles “Perfect Illusion” and “Million Reasons.” But there was a deeper source of anguish on  Joanne   too. The album is named for  her  aunt  an aspiring artist who died of lupus at age 19 in 1974. “Seeing what that did to [my father] and my family was the most powerful thing I experienced growing up ” Gaga tells the journalist Darryl Pinckney in the film. “I am Joanne. I am my father’s daughter. That is what this record is about.”
The most memorable scene of the documentary comes when she first plays the album’s delicate  acoustic title track for her grandmother   Joanne’s  mom. The moment verges on uncomfortable  and not only because Gaga’s father   Joanne’s  brother  gets up and leaves the room in apparent distress midway through. Gaga herself seems hungry to have her telling of an ordeal she did not personally experience validated by those who did. “Did I get it right?” she asks her grandmother  mid-hug. “Yes you did ” her grandmother responds. But she has a warning for Gaga  too: “Don’t become maudlin over all this.” For now  Gaga is asking not for applause but understanding. It’s never explicitly stated  but Gaga seems to connect to  Joanne ’s story in part because of  her  own medical situation. Iconography about hospitals and crutches and wheelchairs over the years hinted that the seemingly bionic pop star faced problems of the flesh off-stage. In 2010   she  told Larry King  she  tested “borderline positive” for lupus.  She ’s still feeling the effects of the injury  she  sustained in 2013  as seen in a Five Foot Two moment when  she  pauses rehearsals for  her  Super Bowl halftime show because of hip tightness.  Fibromyalgia  appears to make that problem worse  and being a pop star in chronic pain certainly doesn’t seem easy. One scene shows  her  having  her  makeup done for a performance while sitting in a doctor’s examination room.
Gaga’s particular ailment is an almost-literal rendering of Jamison’s “pain without a cause”—which is  as  she  notes  “pain which can’t be trusted.” A poorly understood but widespread disorder that seems to inordinately affect women  fibromyalgia is sometimes assumed to be psychosomatic. “Drug Approved. Is Disease Real?” read a 2008 New York Times headline about the first FDA-sanctioned drug to treat it. Gaga has said that she wants to help raise awareness and research dollars. During one excruciating flare-up shown in Five Foot Two  she sympathizes with less-privileged sufferers of the disorder: “Like  I don’t know what I’d fuckin’ do if I didn’t have everybody here to help me.” A few moments later  she’s looking straight into the camera. “Do I look pathetic?” she asks  tear-streaked  lying on a couch  a therapist massaging her. “I’m so embarrassed.” It’s a powerful moment because the stigma of pain is clearly part of the pain itself. But it’s also aesthetically striking. To answer Gaga’s question  she actually looks like she did in parts of the “Bad Romance” video—crying  stripped down  and oddly luminous. It’s a sign of fame’s power on the viewer: Whatever lengths she might go to put person over persona  the persona remains. * * * Pop music has firmly moved on from the phase of gleeful  Technicolor artifice that Gaga stood for at her peak. Contemporaries in wildness like Kesha and Miley Cyrus have done much what Gaga has done and traded Alexander McQueen creations for cowboy boots. They have also made a diaristic turn  harmonizing their music with their angsty  tabloid sagas.
Usually this means trading on the spectacle of suffering to sell pop’s ultimate commodity—inspiration. Beyoncé’s Lemonade is the signal example  taking the sting of infidelity to spin a tale of hurt and overcoming. Kesha’s alleged abuse by her mentor and producer Dr. Luke was addressed and transcended on this year’s Rainbow. Katy Perry marketed her latest album with an on-camera therapy session in which she cried about her “real” self wanting to be known. Taylor Swift seems on the verge of unveiling a more acidic survival story. “Victim to victory” songs are always in fashion  but the latest boom relies  more than pop usually does  on the feeling of authenticity. Adult listeners of drive-time radio typically know they’re in the realm of fantasy and commerce  yet fully enjoying the confessional-pop performance means buying into the non-musical narratives surrounding them. Beyoncé rolled her own child and husband into the Lemonade visual experience. “I write this shit  baby ” Kesha insisted on a recent single. You’re explicitly asked to believe that the gap between performer and person is negligible.  Joanne  already fit into this triumphant-confessional class  with Gaga singing about family members and friends by name and roaring  “I might not be flawless but you know I’ve got a diamond heart.” The meta-text  all along  was Gaga’s own career arc—a sense that  she ’d come down from the heights  she ’d reached from 2008 to 2013  stumbled with  her  third album  and might never recover. Glimmers of past traumas and family tragedy contributed to the pathos.  Her  medical troubles would seem to retroactively add in a new layer  though it’s unclear when  she  received  her  fibromyalgia diagnosis  and little on the album can be heard as an explicit reference to illness. Certainly the lyrics about healing through love on  her  post- Joanne  single  “The Cure ” now seem a lot less generic.

input: If  Corey   Crawford âs âupper-bodyâ injury keeps  him  out the rest of the season  which was a possibility indicated by Sportsnetâs Elliotte Friedman  then the Blackhawks will have a âlower-standingsâ issue.
When  Crawford  was placed on the injured list on Dec. 27  the Hawks were two points behind the Wild for the second wild-card spot  but held two games in hand.
Without  Crawford   the Hawks have gone 5-4-1 and find themselves three points behind the eighth-seeded Kings  who also have a game in hand.
To recap  their lot without  Crawford  has become worse  and it could get a lot worse if  he  continues to suffer from vertigo again as reported by the Chicago Sun-Times.
 Crawford  has been the Hawksâ best player this season  and itâs not even close.  He  won a lot of games by  himself  when  his  teammates proved inept or inert.  His  play had been Vezina Trophy-worthy  and even now  his  .929 save percentage ranks third in the league while  his  2.27 goals-against average stands fifth overall.
It seems impossible to imagine the Hawks trading for  another Crawford  and they donât have an extra one handy. Jeff Glass has a better backstory than a future as a playoff goalie from what Iâve seen. Anton Forsberg seems earnest and talented  but his goals-against average is more than a half-goal worse than Crawfordâs  which is a bad thing for a once-dominant team that sadly sometimes canât score even a half-goal a game. See Sundayâs shutout-loss-tank-job against the dreaded Red Wings at home on Sunday.
The long-range view goes only to Feb. 26. Thatâs the trade deadline. The Hawks will play 18 games before then and have a little more than five weeks to get some good news on  Crawford .

input: In 2016   Lemonis  partnered with Parlour Enterprises  which operated the California Farrell's locations  to revive the brand in exchange for a 51 percent stake in the Farrell's trademark.
 Lemonis  entrusted Parlour Enterprise CFO Paul Kramer and  its  since-resigned CEO Mike Fleming with the task of revamping the restaurant.
Instead  Kramer and Fleming neglected the changes  Lemonis  had requested. The most successful Farrell's location  which once brought in over $4 million in sales  closed down because the owners' were behind on rent.
""I got basically a big F.U. and I have to decide whether I just want to cut my losses and move on because I don't want to throw good money after a bad situation ""  Lemonis  said.
When  Lemonis  investigated further into Farrell's demise   he  spoke with Lee  who had been working as a regional manager at the restaurant for nearly six years and was in charge of updating the restaurant's menu in 2016.
Lee admitted he wasn't able to do his job properly because of Kramer's resistance to change. After negotiating a new lease for Farrell's most successful location   Lemonis  agreed to help save the restaurant in exchange for a 75 percent stake in the company.
Unlike Fleming and Kramer  Lee did his best to help keep Farrell's afloat. ""For Travis  it's always about the customer  it's always about the employee  it's always about the company  "" Lemonis  said. ""It's never about him.""
That's why  Lemonis  went the extra step to acknowledge Lee's dedication to Farrell's.
""Thank yous are necessary but  let's be honest  they're not everything. So I want to give you a bonus  "" Lemonis  said. ""[This could] never have worked without you.""
The bonus not only showed  Lemonis'  gratitude for the extra effort Lee put into the business  it's also a tactic that could boost Lee's morale and productivity.
Lee  meanwhile  expressed his appreciation for  Lemonis'  leadership move and said the money would help his family.
Under Lee's new changes  the new Farrell's location is expected to make $4.2 million in revenue â which prompted  Lemonis  to called  him  a ""rockstar.""
""You have not only earned my trust but you have earned my respect ""  Lemonis  told Lee. ""You don't work for Farrell's  you're my partner at Farrell's.""
""You're not an employee. This is your business ""  he  added. ""Don't you ever forget that this is your business.""

The letter â which complains that the $95 million being spent on a new police academy would be better spent on schools â echoes comments directed at  Emanuel  by handfuls of hecklers at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor on Jan. 19  and at the University of California  Los Angeles  on Feb. 12.
In Los Angeles last week   Emanuel  laughed off the protests  telling  his  audience that  he  âdidnât realize there were that many direct flightsâ from Chicago. In Ann Arbor   Emanuel  attempted to engage the protesters  who continued to chant at  him . Some in the audience booed the hecklers.
But the Harvard protesters accuse  Emanuel  of doing too little to halt the decline in the size of Chicagoâs black population and write that  âAs future and current designers  urban planners  policy-makers  organizers and educators  we cannot disregard the people who are in danger because of Rahm Emanuelâs administration.â

Now complete the following example-
input: By any measure , the Mitt Romney for president campaign has had a painfully bad week . 
That day , Romney addressed the NAACP convention in Houston . 
The speech was poorly received , so much so that Romney , in an interview that afternoon on Fox Business , told host Neil Cavuto that he had ""expected"" boos . 
Some interpreted that comment as proof that Romney had actually wanted to be booed by the NAACP in order to rev up elements of the conservative base . 
The Romney campaign next reacted by whispering to the Drudge Report -LRB- which acts as a kind of message board for Romney -RRB- that it was seriously considering Condoleezza Rice as a running mate . 
Gillespie : Romney retroactively retired . 
Gillespie : Romney retroactively retired 02:44 . 
And it was that ""win the hour"" mentality that got the Romney campaign into much more serious trouble when the Obama campaign launched a big push on Romney 's business record the next day . 
Gergen : Obama 's charges vs. Romney do n't hold up . 
Thursday morning , the Obama campaign released a tough ad attacking the record of downsizing and outsourcing at Romney 's old firm , Bain Capital . 
The Romney campaign reacted with outrage . 
In support of the ad , Romney 's team argued that he had left Bain Capital in February 1999 ; the incidents alluded to by the Obama campaign all occurred after that date and had nothing to do with Romney . 
The first attack on Romney had been a jab , dropping Romney 's guard against the haymaker : On Friday , the Obama team counter-charged that it was Romney who was lying in his ads or who had committed a felony , lying on 140 official forms that he signed as CEO and sole shareholder of Bain between 1999 and 2002 . 
Romney now chased the Obama story , granting five TV interviews to reiterate his version of events . 
By Sunday , even Romney supporters were urging the thing he wants least : release of more income tax returns . 
And here again , what got Romney into the trouble was his war room . 
It was the too-fierce response to Attack 1 -- the adamant insistence that Romney had nothing , nothing to do with anything that happened at Bain after February 1999 -- that set up Romney for Attack 2 : Did he lie on SEC forms ? 
Yes , it is technically true that Romney ended his operational role at Bain before he ended his titular role . 
Romney 's core problem is this : He heads a party that must win two-thirds of the white working-class vote in presidential elections to compensate for its weakness in almost every demographic category . 
The white working class is the most pessimistic and alienated group in the electorate , and it especially fears and dislikes the kind of financial methods that gained Romney his fortune . 
Romney has a strong potential defense : Bain was in the business of making companies more efficient and profitable . 
However , it 's not an argument that appeals much to the voters Romney most intensely needs to win . 
And this time , by trying to do too much , the Romney war room may have blasted its own side with lethal friendly fire .

And it sounds like  he  wants options.
""I see my role as CEO to prepare as many people as I can to be CEO  and that's what I'm doing. And then the board makes a decision at that point in time ""  Cook  said in an interview with BuzzFeed News.
 Cook  gave the interview at Apple's new Chicago retail store  a flagship for the company as it looks to turn its locations into must-see attractions.
Apple's head of retail  Angela  Ahrendts  flanked Tim Cook during the interview . It's not surprising  she  was there  but it is notable for  Cook  to discuss succession next to  her .

Now complete the following example-
input: Pittsburgh Steelers offensive tackle Alejandro Villanueva is a former Army Ranger. While his team remained off the field for the national anthem  he stood by the tunnel with his hand over his heart. As the weekend descended into madness from the liberal media over President Trumpâs remarks about NFL players who take a knee during the Star-Spangled Banner  Villanueva proved to be Sundayâs hero.  Yet  Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin  who defended his team âs actions to remain off the field as avoiding playing politics  was disappointed the former Army Ranger visibly stood for the anthem.
âLike I said  I was looking for 100 percent participation  we were gonna be respectful of our football team â said  Tomlin . Guy torched  him :
Let me see if I've got this straight:  Tomlin  -- a Clinton donor and fundraiser -- is upset that Villanueva was not ""respectful of our football team"" because he decided to honor the country for which he's courageously risked his life by not snubbing the national anthem? This is the display of 'disunity' that bothers Tomlin?
Now  Fox Sports 1âs Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe joined  Tomlin   noting that Villanueva should have remained out of sight (via Mediaite) [emphasis mine]:
âIt didnât work for him to step out of the tunnel â Bayless said during Mondayâs edition of Undisputed. âIf  in fact  you had all agreed  you had voted whether a majority or unanimously  to do this as a team to stay up in the tunnel until the Anthem was done. And  Mike Tomlin  was clear.â Baylessâs colleague  Shannon Sharpe  agreed. âTeams  they always take the military mentality  because itâs all for one  one for all. Whatever we decide to do thatâs what weâre going to do.  He  went on  his  own. I get it.  He  was in the military. I commend  him  for  his  service. But in this situation if the team decided that we  all of us  were going to wait in the tunnel while the national anthem is being played  that was the protocol that should have been followed.â
The thing is no one in that universe gets it. No one. We can talk about free speech all day; the point is that 72 percent of Americans view Colin Kaepernick  who started this whole controversy in San Francisco  and  his  national anthem antics as unpatriotic. Thereâs a massive disconnect between the fans and the league. Americans are proud. They respect those who serve and when people take a knee  they see spit flying in the faces of those who have sacrificed to protect our freedoms here at home. Thereâs no changing that. If you have to explain  youâre losing. Sometimes itâs just wrong. And huddling in the tunnel like the Brits during the Blitz because no one could agree on something as simple as respecting and standing for the national anthem is just absurd. Maybe thatâs why Villanueva merchandise is going through the roof. For the bubble  this stunt didnât work  for everyone elseâthere was an American hero honoring our country. No one should be fired or suspended for taking a knee of course. They do deserve a kick in the teeth on social media  which was expected  and they shouldnât expect the intensity to subside.

2. Critics of  Trump ’s decision to end CSR payments seem to forget a federal judge called them unconstitutional and ordered that they stop. — Michael F. Cannon (@mfcannon) October 13  2017
--But the  Trump  administration is injecting turbulence into the Obamacare marketplaces by cutting off the payments just as insurers are finalizing their 2018 plan offerings. Losing the approximately $7 billion in annual payments  which reimburse insurers for discounting deductibles and co-payments for the lowest-income enrollees  is grounds for insurers to back out of their federal contracts to even sell plans next year. The administration had been making the payments on a month-to-month basis  prompting complaints by insurers about a lack of certainty as they tried to plan ahead.

 TRUMP TEMPERATURE
--Yesterday  President Trump  signed an anticipated executive order intended to circumvent certain ACA rules by making it easier for individuals and small business to buy alternative types of health insurance with lower prices but fewer benefits  The Post's Amy Goldstein reports.
""The White House and allies portray  the president’s  move as wielding administrative powers to accomplish what congressional Republicans have failed to achieve: fostering more coverage choices while tearing down the law’s insurance marketplaces "" Amy writes. ""The order represents  Trump ’s biggest step to date to reverse the health-care policies of the Obama administration  a central promise since last year’s presidential campaign.
""Critics  who include state insurance commissioners  most of the health-insurance industry and mainstream policy specialists  predict that a proliferation of these other kinds of coverage will have damaging ripple effects: driving up costs for consumers with serious medical conditions and prompting more insurers to flee the law’s marketplaces. Part of  Trump ’s action  they say  will spark court challenges over  its  legality.""
--It expands the availability of short-term insurance policies  which offer limited benefits as a bridge for people between jobs or young adults no longer eligible for their parents’ health plans. The Obama administration ruled that short-term insurance may not last for more than three months;  Trump  wants to extend that to nearly a year.
Of course   Trump  insisted yesterday that  he  was providing ""Obamacare relief"" in remarks shortly before signing the order. ""This will cost the United States government virtually nothing and people will have great  great  healthcare ""  he  said. ""And when i say people  I mean by the millions and millions.""

(Bill Gorman / AP) (Bill Gorman / AP)
A U.S. military official said that a military hostage team had flown to Pakistan Wednesday  prepared to fly the family out. The team did a preliminary health assessment of the family and had a transport plane ready to go. But sometime after daybreak there  as the family members were walking to the plane   Boyle  said  he  did not want to board.
Another U.S. official said  Boyle  was nervous about being in ""custody"" given  his  background.
 Boyle  was once married to Zaynab Khadr  the older sister of former Guantanamo Bay detainee Omar Khadr and the daughter of a late senior al-Qaida financier. Her father  Ahmed Said Khadr  and the family stayed with Osama bin Laden briefly when Omar Khadr was a boy.
Officials had discounted any link between that background and  Boyle 's capture  with one official describing it in 2014 as a ""horrible coincidence.""
The Toronto Star reported that  Boyle  spoke to  his  parents after  his  release. "" Josh  said  he  was doing pretty well for someone who has spent the last five years in an underground prison ""  his  father told the paper.
The release came together rapidly Wednesday. It happened nearly five years to the day after Coleman and  Boyle  lost touch with their families while traveling in a mountainous region near the Afghan capital of Kabul.
The couple set off in the summer 2012 for a journey that took them to Russia  the central Asian countries of Kazakhstan  Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan  and then to Afghanistan. Coleman's parents last heard from their son-in-law on Oct. 8  2012  from an internet cafe in what  Boyle  described as an ""unsafe"" part of Afghanistan.
 Boyle 's parents say their son told them in a letter that he and his wife tried to protect the children by pretending their signs of captivity were part of a game being played with guards.

Referring to strikes in which terrorists have attacked people using knives or vehicles   Duke  said ""Creating terror is their goal.""
 Duke  warned it was taking less time for terrorists to plan attacks as they could exploit ""safe spaces online"" to evade detection  the outlet noted.

Upset about damaging leaks of  his  calls with world leaders and other national security information   Trump  has ordered an internal investigation to find the leakers. Staffers  meanwhile  are so fearful of being accused of talking to the media that some have resorted to a secret chat app — Confide — that erases messages as soon as they’re read.
The chaos and competing factions that were a  Trump  trademark in business and campaigning now are starting to define his presidency  according to interviews with a dozen White House officials as well as other Republicans. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss internal White House dynamics and deliberations.
Staffers buzz privately about who is up and who is down  with many eagerly gossiping about which poor colleague gets an unflattering portrayal on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live.” For the past two weeks  it has been White House press secretary Sean Spicer. But aides said  Trump  was especially upset by a sketch that cast White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon as the Grim Reaper manipulating the president — who was ultimately relegated to a miniature desk  playing dolefully with an expandable toy.
[ Trump  turns Mar-a-Lago Club dinner table into an open-air situation room]
On Monday afternoon  as speculation of a staff shake-up was rife on cable news channels   Trump  made clear to a small group of reporters what  he  thought of  his  chief of staff: “Reince is doing a great job. Not a good job. A great job ” the president said.
The problem:  Trump  had yet to weigh in  and aides and advisers were loath to take sides without knowing for certain whether their often mercurial and erratic boss wanted to keep Flynn or cut him loose.
On Monday  after  Trump  made it through a joint news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau without being asked about Flynn  a group of reporters gathered outside Spicer’s office for more than 80 minutes. Spicer twice declined to answer questions about Flynn. When White House chief of staff Reince Priebus walked by  he was asked whether the president still had confidence in Flynn. Priebus gave no answer.
Not long after  Kellyanne Conway  the counselor to the president  said  Trump  had “full confidence” in Flynn. Yet a few minutes later  Spicer issued an official — and conflicting — statement  saying  Trump  was “evaluating the situation.”

Christopher Ruddy  a longtime friend of  Trump ’s who on Sunday publicly criticized Priebus in television and print interviews as being “in way over his head ” received calls from both the chief of staff and Jared Kushner — Trump’s son-in-law  senior adviser and enforcer — and said Monday that he thought the White House was working to remedy its challenges.
 Trump ’s legislative affairs team — headed by Rick Dearborn and Marc Short  both veterans of the Hill — is also considered well-liked  disciplined and professional. But congressional staffers say they have been given advance notice about some executive orders on topics such as cybersecurity and Guantanamo Bay that have never materialized  a delay they attribute to chaos within the West Wing.

input: Another conservative outsider  successful businessman and conservative state Representative Mike Braun of Jasper   has announced  he  is entering a 2018 Indiana Republican Senate Primary.
 Braun  is the founder and CEO of Meyer Distributing  a nationwide auto parts distribution company with locations in 38 states and headquartered in Jasper  Indiana.
AP reports  Braun  correctly observing that the increasingly bitter feud between Messer and Rokita is turning off voters.  He  says harsh words between the two will only tear down the eventual Republican nominee and boost incumbent Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly's re-election chances.
âI made my career in the private sector. Our country needs more people who can tackle big issues from perspectives gained from running a business and not a career politicianâs perspective â  Braun  stated in  his  announcement. âIâve spent my life building a business and creating jobs. I am running for US Senate because we need leaders who understand the real consequences of the failure of our federal government and are capable of delivering solutions for Hoosiers on issues like health care and tax reform.â
âJoe Donnelly has consistently voted with the liberals in Washington. Donnelly voted for Obamacare  Obamaâs radical Supreme Court justices  trillions in reckless spending and debt  and stood with Barack Obama as he worked to destroy this country. Now he is standing with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer as they block President Trumpâs efforts to bring real conservative change to Washington â charged  Braun .
âI am ready to go to Washington to deliver Donald Trump reinforcements as he takes on the DC swamp. Last yearâs presidential election showed that Hoosiers know outsiders with business experience are the countryâs best hope to fix the broken political system in Washington. Most importantly  Hoosiers want leaders who can break the hold career politicians have on the system and make conservative change happen. Itâs time to replace Joe Donnelly with a Hoosier conservative who can get the job done. That is what I will do in Washington â  Braun  said.
Braun  who has pledged to invest  his  own money to put  his  campaign on the same footing as the better-known Rokita and Messer is already emphasizing  his  outsider status.
""Last year's presidential election showed that Hoosiers know outsiders with business experience are the country's best hope to fix the broken political system in Washington ""  Braun  said in a statement.
 Braun  has also placed  himself  squarely behind President Trumpâs make America great again agenda  saying  he  pledged to help President Donald Trump ""as  he  takes on the D.C. swamp"" and incisively portraying Democratic incumbent Senator Joe Donnelly as an ally of liberals in Congress.
 Mike Braun  is a smart guy and successful businessman who spent the summer gauging interest among the Hoosier stateâs grassroots Republicans.  He âs got the resources to be competitive and  he âs clearly taken the lay of the political landscape and determined thereâs a hole in the marketplace for an outsider candidate.  He  will be a formidable candidate if  he  can stay the course of pushing the Trump MAGA agenda  while avoiding a mudwrestling match with Rokita and Messer.

input: MANCHESTER  England (Reuters) - British finance minister Philip Hammond defended capitalism as the only route to prosperity on Monday  in an attempt to counter the opposition Labour Partyâs increasingly popular vision for a more centrally-controlled economy.
In a speech to the ruling Conservative Party that contained only two new policy announcements   Hammond  also said that the governmentâs immediate task was to deal with the uncertainty for citizens and businesses resulting from Brexit.
 Hammond   who was sidelined by May during the election campaign  said last weekâs Labour Party conference showed it wanted to impose on Britain  the worldâs fifth largest economy  the âsocialist fantasyâ seen in Cuba  Venezuela or Zimbabwe.
âWe saw Labour in the raw  exposed for what it has sadly become: a party taken hostage by a clique of hard-left extremist infiltrators  people who despise Britainâs values and talk down our country â  Hammond  told Conservative Party activists.
Seeking to put the economy center-stage in the Conservativesâ pitch to voters   Hammond  said Britain could only hope to experience rising living standards âby harnessing the power of the market economyâ.
With opinion polls showing Labour gaining support   Hammond  aims to convince voters that Corbyn would make them poorer.
Labourâs leaders   he  said  âopenly proclaim their ambition to demolish our successful modern market economy and replace it with a back-to-the-future socialist fantasy with hundreds of billions of extra debt for the next generation to pay.â
âOur economy is not broken: It is fundamentally strong â  Hammond  said  while also accepting that a lack of progress in talks on Britainâs divorce settlement with the European Union and uncertainty over future ties were weighing on businesses.
âThe process of negotiating our exit from the EU has created uncertainty so investment has slowed as businesses wait for clarity â  Hammond  said.
 Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond  speaks at the Conservative Party's conference in Manchester  Britain October 2  2017. REUTERS/PHIL NOBLE
Business groups welcomed Hammondâs defense of free markets  but said the government needed to do much more.
 Hammond  pledged 400 million pounds ($535 million) of additional road and rail spending and 10 billion pounds of funding to help young Britons get on the property ladder.
âWe must never deny or dismiss the underlying concerns that the election articulated: we must listen to them and we must respond â  Hammond  said  adding that the government should offer âpragmatic solutionsâ to improve ordinary peopleâs lives.
But with Brexit on the horizon  a slowing economy and the Bank of England hinting that interest rates could rise  May and  Hammond  have limited room for fiscal maneuver.
Labour said Hammondâs speech on Monday was disappointing.

input: WASHINGTON â  Anthony Scaramucci   President Trump's former communications director  is on a list of people blocked from entering the White House without special approval.
A day after saying he wasn't blocked  a White House official confirmed that  Scaramucci  is indeed among fired officials excluded from the campus. The acknowledgment came after the financier provided to Bloomberg News official White House correspondence that confirmed he was denied an appointment.
 Scaramucci  is among a group of former staffers who left ""under adverse circumstances"" placed on an ""administrative exclusion list "" the White House said in response to Bloomberg's questions. Those former employees must have any appointments on the premises ""evaluated on a case by case basis.""
 Scaramucci  provided emails indicating  he  had been denied access to the complex to counter a White House official's assertion Thursday that  his  claim of being blacklisted from the building was false. At the time  the official - who requested anonymity to discuss personnel matters - said  Scaramucci  was treated the same as any former staffer and would be granted access if  he  had legitimate  official business.
 Scaramucci  slams 'General Jackass' Kelly for blocking W.H. access
When an aide on Feb. 6 tried to get  Scaramucci  into the building  the Secret Service agent in charge of the appointment-scheduling system emailed that  Scaramucci  is ""administratively excluded from entering the complex at this time (not allowed access)."" The agent referred questions to White House Management and Administration staffer Monica Block.
Another message shows that when the aide asked Block about access for  Scaramucci   Block said only White House chief of staff John Kelly or deputy chief of staff Joe Hagin could override Scaramucci's exclusion.
The former communications adviser believes Kelly is blocking his access to the president.  Scaramucci  called for the chief of staff's resignation last month after disclosures that former staff secretary Rob Porter kept his job with access to top-secret information despite a background investigation that revealed allegations of domestic abuse by two of Porter's ex-wives.

The dispute over access to the White House comes as  Scaramucci  has renewed his offensive against Kelly following a chaotic week that included the resignation of Hope Hicks  a longtime Trump loyalist who now holds the communications director position.
""Does the president want to lose everyone because of General Jackass?""  Scaramucci  said Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg News  warning there would be ""a further evacuation of talent.""

Kelly on Friday defended  his  handling of the Porter scandal in a discussion with reporters  saying  he  had obtained a resignation from the former aide within hours of learning of the abuse allegations and tightened access to classified material at the White House. Kelly did acknowledge a ""disconnect"" at the White House in evaluating Porter's background check and a ""mix-up"" in issuing a public statement supportive of the former staff secretary despite the allegations.

 Delegate-Elect Lee Carter  Urges Virginians  State Water Board to Reject Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley Pipeline Projects
“Dominion Resources and EQT have not compellingly demonstrated the need for the additional natural gas capacity in Virginia ” said  Carter . “And to make matters worse  that natural gas wouldn’t even be used for Virginian homes – the pipeline will run through the Commonwealth and be sent to Japan and India for export.”
 Carter  also has concerns that the project will massively increase Virginia’s carbon footprint  and destroy protected wilderness areas  as well as state and federal parks.
“Hardworking Virginians are going to end up paying for these unnecessary projects through higher power bill  in spite of the lack of economic benefit for Virginia  and if anything goes wrong with the pipeline  thousands of those Virginians will be in the ‘incineration zone’ – an area where all life would be incinerated if the pipeline explodes ” said  Carter .
 Carter  urges all to attend the Water is Life Rally in Richmond on December 2 from 1 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.
“Virginians need to fight back hard against these projects that are not only unnecessary – they’re dangerous ” said  Carter .
 He  also urges residents to attend the State Water Control Board’s meetings on December 6 and 7 and December 11 and 12 for the pipeline projects  and speak on their concerns about how these projects hurt our communities.

input: Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart  is going to court to unmask the person who alleged in emails to politicians  Chicago police investigators and journalists that  Dart  attacked  his  wife at their South Side home.
 Dart  filed the legal papers Wednesday in his personal capacity  not as sheriff  and hired lawyer John F. Winters Jr.  who specializes in defamation cases. Such court filings are often a prelude to a defamation lawsuit filed against the person behind anonymous emails or web postings.
“ Tom  has been subjected to sustained attacks on  his  integrity  and even threats to  his  life  during  his  tenure as sheriff ” said Dennis Culloton  who is acting as  Dart ’s personal spokesman  in a statement. “Over the past several months  these attacks have escalated to include false and vicious rumors involving his wife and family  perpetuated by cowards who hide behind fake email addresses and anonymous blogs. Through this filing we hope to hold those people accountable.”
The first of two October emails cited in the filing allege  Dart  “committed a Domestic Battery” on his wife “causing visible injuries to her face” that were observed by responding Chicago and Cook County sheriff’s police on either Oct. 11 or 12. They allege a police report was taken but that the attacker was listed as “unknown” and that a 911 call was placed to  Dart ’s home.
“This incident is being attempted to be swept under the rug ” the email’s author  who describes himself as a “Cook County taxpayer” named “Dan ” writes.  “Tom Dart  should not be able to get away with this!”
Records show a complaint was also made to a Chicago police oversight agency in October alleging that police refused to act or take reports “in regards to an incident that occurred at  Sheriff Tom Dart’s  home that involved  his  wife and  his  girlfriend.”

input: Gary Kaplan  50  must also forfeit $43.6 million in illegally obtained revenue as part of a plea agreement. Prosecutors have said that amounts to more than half of Kaplan's total worth.
 Kaplan pleaded guilty in August to racketeering conspiracy  violating the Wire Wager Act and conspiring to violate it. Prosecutors had been investigating offshore sports gambling since 1997  and BetOnSports since 2001.
 Kaplan  sentenced to four years and three months  could end up spending another year behind bars. He has been jailed for two years and seven months since his March 2007 arrest in Puerto Rico. U.S. District Judge Carol Jackson said it will be up to the Bureau of Prisons to determine if he is given credit for time served. Attorneys in the case noted that federal rules call for him serving 85 percent of the 51-month sentence  minus whatever credit he may be given for time served.
 In his guilty plea in August  Kaplan said BetOnSports had 1 million registered customers and accepted more than 10 million sports bets worth more than $1 billion in 2004 alone. HisHis company  by then based in Costa Rica  employed 1 700 people.
 Kaplan took BetOnSports public on the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market in 2004  which netted him more than $100 million that was deposited in Swiss bank accounts. For the next two years  he served as a BetOnSports consultant.
 Prosecutors said the company falsely advertised that its gambling operations were legal  and misled gamblers into believing that money transferred to BetOnSports was safe and available to withdraw at any time. Instead  investigators said  the money was used to expand operations  including purchase of a rival betting firm.
 Kaplan told Jackson in August that he initially believed that adhering to the laws in Aruba  Antigua  Costa Rica  the Dominican Republic and the United Kingdom kept him in good stead with U.S. laws. But he said he became aware as early as 2000 that such dealings violated U.S. law  and got confirmation in a legal opinion in 2002. Yet  he kept operating.
 Kaplan apologized to the judge Monday for the ""pain and embarrassment"" he caused to his family  and said he'd ""paid a monumental price for poor decisions."" His attorneys said that Kaplan  from his jail cell  has made six-figure contributions to St. Louis-area charities in recent months.
 Jackson said while recognizing Kaplan's generosity  she was ""a little put off"" by letters she's received from those charities on his behalf.
 ""When I make a charitable contribution  I don't expect credit "" she said. ""I hope you will continue to support worthy charitable organizations even when it doesn't further any personal interest you may have.""

This week  the Natural History Museum in London released images of Cheddar Man  a dark-skinned Mesolithic man believed to be one of the oldest modern humans in Britain.  Nehlen  posted the couple's official engagement photo with Cheddar Man's face superimposed on Markle's  who is biracial.  He  captioned the tweet  ""Honey does this tie make my face look pale?""
The tweet is hardly  Nehlen 's first instance of controversy. The politician has made waves for racist and anti-Semitic tweets in the past and proclaimed that ""Jews control the media"" on former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke's podcast last month.
 Nehlen  ""has spent months curating an image of a sometimes ironic  but most certainly sincere  white nationalist willing to say things intended to push populist nationalism into the discourse "" writes the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Twitter  which does not normally comment on individual accounts  confirmed to NPR that  Nehlen  was permanently suspended for repeated violations of  its  terms of service.

input: Sarah Huckabee Sanders  works in  her  office at the White House in Washington. (Evan Vucci/AP)
This is the world as seen through the eyes of  White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders :
 Sanders  described this perpetual interloper experience from her other world: an elegant  well-appointed office at the White House  where reporters from places such as the New York Times and CNN metaphorically prostrate themselves at her door day in and out  and from where she can receive guidance on the phone every day from her father  long a political darling of conservative Christians  a TV celebrity now worth millions.
As the public face of the U.S. president   Sanders  is a fitting symbol for her fellow religious conservatives  who are both insider and outsider  powerful and powerless.
 Sandersâs  podium persona is all business  even a bit short at times. She so often says she doesnât know the answer to a question or will have to get back to the questioner that it has become a criticsâ meme. âSaturday Night Liveâ featured a spoof of her on its season opener the weekend before last  with faux  Sanders  telling President Trump that her success lies in the fact that âIâm no-nonsense  but Iâm all nonsense.â
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Sept. 13 ESPN anchor Jemele Hill's comments calling President Trump a white supremacist were a ""fireable offense."" ESPN said Hillâs comments do not represent their position. (Reuters)
Facing judgment is part of being Sarah Huckabee Sanders  perhaps the most visible evangelical in U.S. political life (aside from Mike Pence  but Sanders is on the news every day). But unlike her father  Sanders never intended to be the face of anything; until a few months ago  she was known as a behind-the-scenes talented political organizer.
âIn terms of political power  [Christian conservatives] donât have any. I think  Sarah  gets that â said Tyler  long an outspoken Trump critic. âThe ethical challenges of  her  job are amazing. . . . The consistent falsehoods  lies [from Trump] are unbelievable.â
Brian Kaylor  a Baptist pastor with a PhD in political communications who has written several books about religion and politics  thinks  Sanders  holds this view of a divine plan and it gives her confidence at the podium.
 Sanders  doesnât talk about God publicly often â not nearly as much as Trump does these days. People who worked with her on campaigns say sheâd say a pre-event prayer but otherwise was focused on things such as voter strategy. Her faith life mirrors younger evangelicals with their move away from denominations.
A family friend describes  Sanders  and her husband  Bryan Sanders  as âprogressive Christians.â In a compromise  they go to evangelical and Catholic churches every Sunday.
To many religious conservatives   Sanders  is a source of enormous pride. The presence of someone from her background representing the president every day â not to mention the multiple other conservative Christians in Trumpâs Cabinet â has huge symbolic weight  whether or not she has influence or even much contact with  him  and seems to often learn of  his  controversial tweets at the same time the public does.
David Brody  chief political correspondent for the Christian network CBN  said that when  Sanders  comes on the networkâs pro-Trump talk show  âthe social media director said he has never seen so many emoji hearts. . . . She has a charm about her. Sheâs feisty but in a bless-your-heart sort of way.â
Brody said his viewers were wowed by a briefing over the summer  when  Sanders  was asked whether Trump brought low the office of the president by tweeting a crack about television host Mika Brzezinski  whom he called âlow IQ  crazyâ and whom he said he saw âbleeding badly from a face lift.â
Some religious conservatives say one of  Sandersâs  best attributes is that she isnât Sean Spicer. They just want someone at the podium who can defend Trump somewhat effectively without becoming the story.
 Sanders  has a leg up perhaps  as politics is her family business.

 ""Around 85 to 90 percent of our (environmental) concerns have been addressed. The process of building the Navi Mumbai airport can start today. With these compromises we are fully on board and will ensure speedy work "" Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh told the media here.
 The Navi Mumbai airport  which has been planned some 30 kilometers away from the current Chattrapati Shivaji airport in Mumbai  had been a contentious issue because of its environmental impact due to its location. But  the Indian Environment Ministry finally cleared the project.
 Claiming that the plans for the airport have been modified so that one river instead of two will be diverted  the minister said: ""River Gadhi would not be diverted to make way for the airport and added that 161 hectares of mangroves would fall under Navi Mumbai airport.""

input: It was a connection that kept the 15-year-old mom  Cherish Coates  coming back to the nursery each day to visit the baby and drop off breast milk. For the next several weeks   Coates  leaned on Joseph for support as the young mother began the process of putting the baby up for adoption. She relied on the nurse even more when she ultimately decided to tell her family â who had no idea she had given birth to a son in her own bedroom â about the baby  and to keep him  against all odds.
Although the nurse and mother eventually lost touch  their connection inspired  Coates  to become a nurse and eventually enter law school  with hopes of becoming a mental health attorney.

(Nancy Stone/Chicago Tribune)
After 12 years with almost no contact   Coates  reached out to Joseph on Facebook last year with a message that reunited the two women who said they had never forgotten each other. Since then  the pair have been in regular contact  sharing encouragement  photos and a bond that even they sometimes can't believe began more than decade ago with the case still known at the hospital as the ""shoebox baby.""
""I just wanted to let  her  know how much of an impression  she  made "" said  Coates   now a 29-year-old mother of three  including the now 5-foot-3  13-year-old Allen  the baby in the shoebox who brought  her  and Joseph together and is now a thriving eighth-grader.
""It feels like such a blessing "" said  Coates   who works as a law clerk in Mesa  Ariz.  while attending law school. ""We will always be connected because we share this unique story.""
 Coates  grew up painfully aware of the difficulties of teen pregnancies.  Her  own mother was 15 when  she  had Coates  whom  she  left to be raised by  her  loving and devoted grandparents in Rockford.  Her  mother  who dropped out of school and moved out  visited weekly. Family members often warned  Coates  that a pregnancy while  she  was young could keep  her  from becoming the first in  her  family to finish high school and go to college â something they were all rooting for   she  said.
Despite  her  grandparents' best efforts  Coates  at 13 years old  met a boy two years older than  her  while shopping at Cherryvale Mall in Rockford. It didn't take long before  she  and the boy were together every weekend  spending time at the mall and at the movies.
The couple had been inseparable for nearly two years when  Coates  suspected  she  might be pregnant.  She  shared the news with  her  boyfriend  who cried along with  her  as the terrified teens repeatedly discussed what they should do.
 Coates  didn't have to try hard to conceal the small bump that eventually surfaced in  her  belly  because it was barely noticeable.  She  hid morning sickness  kept up  her  A and B grades  and never missed a shift at  her  part-time job at McDonalds   she  said.

He was wrapped in a dish towel and placed in a shoebox with a note asking that he be taken care of and named Allen Corey. The young couple chose to take him there under the stateâs 2001 Safe Haven law  which allows parents to leave a newborn at a hospital  fire station or police station without fear of criminal or civil liability.

Moments later  Coates delivered her baby on the SpongeBob SquarePants comforter covering her bed. She cut  his  umbilical cord with scissors her grandfather had in the house.
""I remember just looking at how beautiful  he  was  and how tiny  he  was. I had never held a baby before; I had never baby-sat or anything "" Coates said. ""I remember being scared that I was going to break  him .""

input: Norway ’ s $ 1 trillion sovereign wealth fund will this year step up its assessment of the risks posed by climate change to its investments in power producers   oil firms and basic materials companies   its CEO told Reuters on Tuesday . Separately   the board of the central bank will soon decide whether to blacklist from the fund one or more companies -- either in the oil   steel or concrete sectors -- for producing too much greenhouse gases   the central bank chief told Reuters . The fund   which invests the proceeds from Norway ’ s oil and gas production for future pensions in stocks   bonds and real estate abroad   is one of the world ’ s biggest shareholders   with stakes totaling 1 . 4 percent of all listed companies . In recent years the world ’ s biggest sovereign wealth fund has become a more active shareholder   trying to influence companies ’ attitudes . Among them are the way companies report on climate change   such as their carbon dioxide emissions   or whether companies have scenario analyses of how more heatwaves   droughts or floods might affect their earnings .  Chief Executive Yngve Slyngstad  said the fund would first focus  its  efforts on electricity producers . “ That is ... the sector that we will first go through and think about in this scenario . The two next ones will be ( basic ) materials and oil .” “ By far the largest ... is electricity producers   which of course has been a specific focus for us because of the so - called coal criteria  ” he said referring to the fund not being allowed by parliament to invest in firms that derive more than 30 percent of their revenue from coal . The proposal to potentially exclude one or more companies in the oil   steel or cement sectors over excessive greenhouse gas emissions is under review by the board of the central bank . “ We have received some recommendations on potential exclusions based on that new criteria . The board is working on the issues ... It ’ s not going to be long  ” central bank governor Oeystein Olsen said   declining to give a more precise timeframe . Slideshow ( 2 Images ) The moves come as the fund is proposing to drop oil and gas stocks from its benchmark index   which would reduce over time its stakes in oil and gas companies . That proposal is under consideration at the finance ministry and will be voted by parliament at a later stage . DOUBLED ITS RETURN IN 2017 Also on Tuesday   the fund said it doubled its return on investment in 2017   beating its benchmark   as strong global stock markets boosted the value of the portfolio . It earned a return of 13 . 7 percent in 2017   up from 6 . 9 percent in 2016 . “ The fund ’ s cumulative return since inception has passed 4   000 billion Norwegian crowns ($ 511 billion ). One out of four crowns of return was generated in 2017   after a very strong year for the fund  ” Slyngstad said in a statement . “ Again   our equity investments returned strongest with a return close to 20 percent .” The fund ’ s biggest single company investment at the end of 2017 was in Apple Inc ( AAPL . O )  worth 66 billion crowns   ahead of Nestle ( NESN . S ) at 51 billion and Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa . L ) at 50 billion . Apple was also the biggest single contributor to the fund ’ s returns in 2017   ahead of Chinese tech group Tencent Holdings ( 0700 . HK ) and Microsoft ( MSFT . O ). The fund ’ s size is equivalent to $ 200   000 for every Norwegian man   woman and child . The government withdrew 61 billion crowns during 2017 to pay for public expenses   compared with 101 billion crowns in 2016 .  Slyngstad  earned an annual salary of 6 . 7 million crowns   or roughly $ 855   000   in 2017   while  his  chief investment officer for equity strategies   Petter Johnsen   earned more   with 7 . 4 million crowns . By comparison   the country ’ s prime minister   Erna Solberg   earned 1 . 6 million crowns .

Now complete the following example-
input: The camera pans across a bucolic river and a sunny cornfield  an American flag flapping in the breeze  as narrator Michael Steele extols the freedom to dream and achieve. Then  with the Statue of Liberty sweeping into the shot  comes a dire warning that freedom is fragile: Democrats  he says  are ""experimenting with America.""
The camera zooms in on a bespectacled Steele  who asks viewers for donations. ""Our freedom "" he says with a smile. ""It's worth fighting for.""
The television advertisement  which aired in selected markets last month  is vintage Steele _ affable  charismatic and seizing the spotlight. But the ad's star is not running for anything. He's the chairman of the Republican National Committee  with a mandate to promote his party rather than himself.
Steele has put a public face on what had been largely a behind-the-scenes job  hoping to foster what he has called a ""hip-hop"" Republican renaissance. That high profile has been accompanied by a record of lavish spending and a string of gaffes  leading some party activists to complain that Steele revels in the perks of the office while neglecting some of the onerous work necessary to reclaim majorities in the House and Senate. This narrative grew more damaging last week with the disclosure that RNC staffers approved a $1 900 bill at a Hollywood nightclub that features topless dancers mimicking lesbian sex acts while wearing bondage gear.
Still there have been no calls for Steele's ouster  and some top Republicans have calculated that there is no upside in forcing out the first black chairman of a party largely dominated by white Southerners _ especially not while the GOP is winning under his watch. Steele claimed credit for recent Republican victories in Massachusetts  Virginia and New Jersey  telling reporters in January: ""I won two governorships and a host of special elections.""
Some Republicans question Steele's contribution to the party's recent successes. Nevertheless  ""To the victor go the spoils "" said Ron Kaufman  a former RNC chairman who worked against Steele in the leadership race. ""Is the party better off today than the day Michael Steele got elected? It's very hard to say no  on almost every level. ... The bottom line is the coach gets the credit. They're paid to win  and we're winning.""
To understand how this one-term lieutenant governor from Maryland became his party's national chairman  go back to the day he was selected  Jan. 30  2009. It was one week after Obama's historic inauguration  and many in the Republican Party were demoralized and seeking new direction.
In a crowded field of candidates for the chairmanship  Steele stood out _ a 6-foot-4  dapper  television-friendly former politician who spoke eloquently of expanding the party's base to include more blacks and Latinos. He offered a break with history as the first African American chairman of what he referred to over and over again as the ""party of Lincoln.""
""The party has really wallowed in the sewers of racial politics in the country "" said NAACP President Ben Jealous  a longtime Steele friend. ""Mike Steele is their chance to get back on higher ground.""
Steele was distrustful of the staff he inherited and the Beltway strategists who cycled through the committee. ""When they drink that Potomac River water a while  it changes them  and Michael has tried never to drink that water "" said John Kane  a close friend who ran the Maryland Republican Party when Steele was lieutenant governor.
So less than a week after his election  Steele asked each staffer to submit a resignation letter. They were told the chairman would decide who could stay  former aides recalled. He let dozens go.
In his early months  Steele  who had been a Fox News Channel commentator  gave several interviews that led to damaging blunders. On CNN  Steele dismissed Rush Limbaugh  a popular voice for the right  as an ""entertainer"" and said Limbaugh's radio talk show can be ""incendiary"" and ""ugly."" He told GQ magazine that abortion was ""an individual choice "" going against his party's antiabortion platform.
Meanwhile  he was making cosmetic changes to the party operation. Steele disliked the dark-wood furnishings in his office  telling GQ it was ""way too male for me."" So he had the RNC spend $18 500 on a new wooden desk  armchairs  a couch and art for the walls  according to aides.
When Steele hit the road to meet local volunteers and operatives  he often brought a photographer to document it all. At party headquarters in Washington  the hallways were decorated with jumbo-size pictures of Steele shaking hands.
Steele declined several requests for interviews for this story because he believes he has received unfair scrutiny from The Washington Post dating to his political career in Maryland  his spokesman Doug Heye said. ""Profile after profile after profile by The Washington Post that almost borders on stalking "" Heye said. ""At a certain point you just stop taking it seriously.""
This report is based on Steele's public comments and interviews with more than three dozen RNC members  donors  party strategists and state officials  as well as Steele's friends  political opponents and current and former aides. They portrayed a complex man who  like most people  is a combination of traits  not 100 percent an industrious political strategist or a feckless self-promoter.

 The Cornhuskers seemed to snare a bit of their lost aura in 2008  winning six of their last seven games. But Suh is hardly ready to compare his defensive unit to those from the glory days.
 In fact  continuing the rebuilding process is one reason why the defensive tackle returned for his senior year instead of being an almost guaranteed high pick in the NFL draft.
 ""I definitely want to be part of bringing back the tradition of the Blackshirts "" said Suh  the Big 12's preseason defensive player of the year. ""That's a tough tradition to live up to.""
 Under defensive-minded new head coach Bo Pelini  the respective numbers above improved to 349.8  28.5 and 49 -- better  but still not what Suh and Pelini consider acceptable.
 ""We're getting closer "" Suh said  ""but we're definitely not where we need to be. We still have room to grow.""
 But with an untested quarterback at the controls of an offense with just four starters returning  it will be up to Suh and the defense to keep the Huskers afloat early in the season. Suh says he's looking forward to the task.
 ""I definitely want to be part of bringing back the tradition of the Blackshirts "" he said. ""We want to start being the kind of dominant team that everyone wants to hunt.""
 Pelini says Suh is that kind of talent.

input: It was deja vu all over again. With Senate Republicans inching closer to passing an Obamacare replacement bill  a potential fulfillment of seven years of campaign promises   Arizona Senator John McCain  once again intervened to save the failing law.  He  dramatically cast the deciding vote to kill a drastically pared-down ""skinny repeal"" bill over the summer  then reprised the spoiler role on Friday afternoon by announcing  his  opposition to legislation championed by  his  close friend and ally  Sen. Lindsey Graham. Between  McCain 's statement and Rand Paul's unconvincing 'purity' posture  Mitch McConnell can't afford to lose a single additional member of his caucus. The truth is  he already has. Anyone who's followed Susan Collins' record on this issue knows that Graham-Cassidy is dead. She's technically only ""leaning"" no  but that's tantamount to a hard no; I'm fairly certain she'd vote against her own Obamacare replacement plan at this point. In revealing his intention to torpedo the latest bill -- with just days remaining before the GOP's reconciliation authority expires  according to the Senate Parliamentarian  -- McCain  used process concerns as  his  primary fig leaf:
In what way is working with Democrats  who are either staunch Obamacare defenders or already moving on to an even bigger government power-grab  likely make healthcare reform better? Like Rand Paul's weak excuse for opposing Graham-Cassidy (given his vote in favor of skinny repeal  which did far less to uproot Obamacare)   McCain 's justification makes little sense. Part of  his  Hamlet act on the previous Senate repeal bill (BCRA) was an insistence that  he  couldn't approve a plan that didn't have the full backing of  his  state's governor  Doug Ducey. ""My position on this proposal will be largely guided by Governor Ducey's analysis of how it would impact the people of our state ""  McCain  claimed at the time. ""My friends  this is legislation that directly affects the people of my state. I trust my governor."" Ducey had raised objections to the BCRA  publicly stating that he agreed with  McCain  that it was fatally flawed. While the governor eventually cleared  McCain  to back ""skinny repeal"" as a means to advancing the process to a conference committee  his concerns about the legislation's underlying content made  McCain 's 'no' vote easier. But guess who explicitly supported the passage of Graham-Cassidy this time? Governor Doug Ducey. Apparently ""trusting his governor"" no longer mattered to McCain. And then there's this:

McCain rightly and ruthlessly blasted his Democratic opponent as a supporter of a law that was inflicting disproportionate harm on Arizonans. Then he proceeded to vote exactly as she would have. The Senator's new position is that a bipartisan ""fix"" is in order. How would his campaign have gone if he'd told voters  ""by 'we must repeal and replace Obamacare ' what I really mean is  'we must work with Patty Murray and the Democrats to tweak Obamacare after promising to abandon repeal'""? Perhaps he'd be former Senator John McCain  no longer in a position to be hailed as a ""hero"" by the exact same people who passionately opposed and slandered him during his presidential run  and who would have called him every name under the sun if he'd reached a different conclusion about a bill written and sponsored by his best friend in Congress. I'll leave you with some journalists wondering if Graham-Cassidy may still have a glimmer of life:

 At the same time  cyber experts and potential job candidates have complained that the position lacks the budgetary and policy-making authority needed to be successful. Schmidt will report to the National Security Council and closely support the National Economic Council on cyber issues.
 Schmidt's selection suggests that economic and business interests in the White House held more sway in the selection process. Schmidt  president and CEO of the Information Security Forum  a nonprofit international consortium that conducts research in information security  has served as chief security officer for Microsoft and as cyber security chief for online auction giant eBay. He was reportedly preferred by Lawrence Summers  director of the economic council. A good format for the titel can be the simple subject + object + verb.

 ""Around 85 to 90 percent of our (environmental) concerns have been addressed. The process of building the Navi Mumbai airport can start today. With these compromises we are fully on board and will ensure speedy work "" Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh told the media here.
 The Navi Mumbai airport  which has been planned some 30 kilometers away from the current Chattrapati Shivaji airport in Mumbai  had been a contentious issue because of its environmental impact due to its location. But  the Indian Environment Ministry finally cleared the project.
 Claiming that the plans for the airport have been modified so that one river instead of two will be diverted  the minister said: ""River Gadhi would not be diverted to make way for the airport and added that 161 hectares of mangroves would fall under Navi Mumbai airport.""

input: Hakeem Nicks and Eli Manning of the New York Giants forged a friendship over cookouts of alligator  crawfish and fried quail. Nicks mostly abstained from eating at the barbecues. It was the conversation that mattered.
 In July  Nicks joined Manning on a four-day trip in Thibodaux  La.  for the Manning Passing Academy  an offensive skills camp for high school players. The getaway brought them together  helping to bond a young play-making wide receiver with a veteran quarterback who could use a big-play target.
 During the day  Nicks served as a counselor and played catch with Manning. By night  Nicks and Manning came together for group dinners before retreating to their dormitories at Nicholls State University  about an hour west of New Orleans.
Nicks and Manning came together for group dinners before retreating to their dormitories at Nicholls State University  about an hour west of New Orleans.
 Still  the coaches are looking for Nicks  who showed explosiveness as a rookie in 2009  to show more consistency in his second season. (On Sunday  Nicks also tipped the first pass his way  which resulted in an interception). Nicks  the type of deep threat the Giants have been missing since the departure of Plaxico Burress  was drafted into an important position. ""That's something I want to do "" Nicks said. ""That's something that I've always done in my career in my past  been that big-target receiver coming deep down the field. I just want to get my game to that and bring it to the team the best way possible.""
 Manning invited Nicks and Steve Smith to join him for the camp this summer. Although Smith could not attend  he said that he has seen the effect the trip has had on the relationship between Nicks and Manning.
 ""It showed Eli he's serious about football and that he wants to get better "" Smith said of Nicks. ""I've seen him take it more seriously in the film room and get in here in the offseason.""
 When discussing certain plays at the camp  Manning would explain his thinking  then Nicks would share his thoughts. It helped their timing  which was important because Nicks missed practices during organized-team activities and in training camp while recovering from knee and toe injuries.
 Off the field  Nicks and Manning watched sports in their rooms and shared insights into each other's lives. Manning was shocked to hear that Nicks had only one scholarship offer in high school. Nicks was shocked to see the type of food the Manning family served in New Orleans.
 The Cajun flavor was new to Nicks -- ""out of my bracket "" the North Carolina native said -- but he enjoyed learning more about the area.

 Like Burress  Nicks is the X receiver  known also as the split end  in the Giants' offense. The X receiver frequently represents the deep threat and often finds himself in one-on-one coverage  as Nicks did on his second and third touchdowns Sunday.

Now complete the following example-
input: The new  Mario  game has some serious film noir vibes. Fans on Twitter have been picking up on the crooked stink of New Donk City since the game came out  but the idea seems to have solidified with the brilliant help of the Storied podcast. The podcast goes on a journey with co-hosts Sean Ainsworth  Harrison Pink  and Chris Rebbert as they transform famous films  TV shows  and games into other mediums.
Presumably inspired by the recent rumors that an official Super Mario Bros. movie is in the works  the hosts pondered the best method for bringing  Mario 's pixels onto the silver screen. Sure  the happy-go-lucky world of Nintendo might not scream ""gritty monochromatic detective drama."" But you're clearly just not paying attention (or exploring Photo Mode in Super Mario Odyssey.)
Their proposed script begins with a panning shot over pictures of a smiling Luigi  as  Mario  grieves over the death of his brother and the better half of their Super Mario Bros. P. I. firm. His voiceover is all tough talk  while maintaining the trademark cartoonish Italian stereotype we've come to love.
What proceeds is your usual  Mario  game plot  with a damsel in distress who needs the help of a hero to escape a mafia-style boss with tons of goons stalking about town. Bowser  a local land baron in the tradition of Chinatown  is up to his no-good tricks and is trying to marry her and take all her inheritance money.
If anyone is wondering  I've got this frame of Mario Odyssey paused  and am currently narrating ""Mario  P.I."" as a film noir series while I have jazz music playing in the background.
In honor of his dead brother   Mario  goes on a wild-goose chase to rescue  his  dame.
Some key scenes include: 1)  Mario  meeting up with Bowser at a country club  with Bowser intimidating the detective by totally owning his opponent in Wii Tennis while  Mario  tries to question him  2) A second femme fatale  in the form of Birdo  who cannot speak English but gives  Mario  an egg with a key piece of evidence before she's murdered  3) One (if not several) car chase scenes  in which the cars are replaced with  Mario  go-karts and the tommy guns replaced with Blue Shells.
But  like any good noir film  the journey ends in deception. As  Mario  gets deeper into the investigation  eventually managing to kill Bowser  he learns a sickening truth. The Koopa King and Drug Lord Bowser was actually just small pennies compared to the real boss in charge: Princess Peach  who runs the drug operation at the heart of the Mushroom Kingdom. She needed a fall guy.  Mario  was her guy. Bowser took the fall.
The story closes on  Mario  as  he  lays dying  and Luigi emerges from the shadows to give the princess a kiss.

input: A massive California wildfire that has already destroyed nearly 800 structures scorched another 56   000 acres on Sunday   making it the fifth largest such blaze in recorded state history   as it ran toward picturesque coastal cities . But fire officials said as darkness fell that with the hot   dry Santa Ana winds not as fierce as expected   crews had been successful in building some fire lines between the flames and the towns of Montecito and Carpinteria . “ This is a menacing fire   certainly   but we have a lot of people working very diligently to bring it under control  ” Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown told an evening press conference . Still   some 5   000 residents remained under evacuation orders in the two communities   near Santa Barbara and about 100 miles ( 160 km ) northwest of Los Angeles . Some 15   000 homes were considered threatened . The Thomas Fire   the worst of six major blazes in Southern California in the last week and already the fifth largest in the state since 1932   has blackened 230   000 acres ( 570   000 hectares )  more than the area of New York City . It has destroyed 790 houses   outbuildings and other structures and left 90   000 homes and businesses without power . The combination of Santa Ana winds and rugged terrain in the mountains that run through Santa Barbara and Ventura counties have hampered firefighting efforts   and officials said the Thomas Fire was only 10 percent contained on Sunday evening   down from 15 percent earlier in the day . But wind gusts recorded at 35 - 40 miles per hour were less than those predicted by forecasters   giving crews a chance to slow the flames ’ progress down slopes above the endangered communities . The fires burning across Southern California have forced the evacuation of more 200   000 people and destroyed some 1   000 structures . Among them are residents of Montecito   one of the state ’ s wealthiest enclave and home to such celebrities as Oprah Winfrey . Emmy Leikin   an Emmy - winning songwriter who was ordered to evacuate her Montecito home at 9 a . m . on Sunday   said she fled with only her cell phone   medication   eyeglasses and a few apples . Leikin   74   said she doesn ’ t know the condition of her home and belongings but “ none of that means anything when it is your safety .” Firefighters knock down flames as they advance on homes atop Shepherd Mesa Road in Carpinteria   California   U .

REUTERS / Mike Eliason / Santa Barbara County Fire Department / Handout via REUTERS WORST IN A DECADE The fires that began last Monday night collectively amounted to one of the worst conflagrations across Southern California in the last decade . They have   however   been far less deadly than the blazes in Northern California ’ s wine country in October that killed over 40 . In the last week   only one death has been reported   a 70 - year - old woman who died Wednesday in a car accident as she attempted to flee the flames in Ventura County . Scores of horses have died   including at least 46 at a thoroughbred training facility in San Diego county . Residents and firefighters alike have been alarmed by the speed with which the fires spread   reaching into the heart of cities like Ventura . Slideshow ( 9 Images ) At the Ventura County Fairgrounds   evacuees slept in makeshift beds while rescued horses were sheltered in stables .  Peggy Scissons   78    arrived at the shelter with  her  dog last Wednesday   after residents of  her  mobile home park were forced to leave .  She  has not yet found out whether  her  home is standing . “ I don ’ t know what ’ s gonna happen next or whether I ’ ll be able to go home  ”  she  said . “ It would be one thing if I were 40 or 50   but I ‘ m 78 . What the heck do I do ?” James Brown   57   who retired from Washington State ’ s forestry service and has lived in Ventura for a year   was forced to leave his house along with his wife last week because both have breathing problems . “ We knew a fire was coming   but we didn ’ t know it would be this bad  ” said Brown   who is in a wheelchair . Some of the other fires   in San Diego and Los Angeles counties   have been largely controlled by the thousands of firefighters on the ground this week . Both the Creek and Rye fires in Los Angeles County were 90 percent contained by Sunday morning   officials said   while the Skirball Fire in Los Angeles ’ posh Bel Air neighborhood was 75 percent contained . North of San Diego   the 4   100 - acre ( 1   660 hectare ) Lilac Fire was 75 percent contained by Sunday and most evacuation orders had been lifted .

input: When  Harvard physician Monique Tello  looks at the typical American breakfast   she  said  it makes  her  ""want to cry.""
""A bowl of cereal  or a bagel  or a piece of toast  or a muffin are all no different than a dessert  "" Tello  wrote in a recent Harvard Health blog post.
""Eating like this may be okay once in a while  but if you do so often  I guarantee these foods will make you sick  one way or another  "" Tello  said.
Here's what  Tello  eats: a combination of berries  Icelandic-style (high protein) yogurt  and a mix of nuts  seeds  and rolled oats.
""Iâm a working mom. I take the train into work. I need something quick  easy  and transportable. Plus  it needs to be budget-friendly  and must hold me over for a number of hours  "" Tello  said.
So  her  breakfast is based around three simple ingredients:
Berries:  Tello  buys a mix of frozen raspberries  blueberries  and strawberries in bulk  since ""fruit is frozen at the peak of freshness  so the quality and vitamin content can be better than whatâs in the produce aisle.""

In his opening remarks at the meeting with  Tillerson   Abadi said Popular Mobilisation âis part of the Iraqi institutions â rejecting accusations that it is acting as an Iranian proxy.
 Tillerson  visited Iraq a day after a rare joint meeting with Abadi and Saudi Arabiaâs King Salman in the Saudi capital  Riyadh.
At his meeting with Abadi in Baghdad   Tillerson  urged the Iraqi government and Masoud Barzaniâs Kurdistan Regional Government in Erbil to resolve their conflict on Kurdish self-determination and disputed territories through dialogue.
âWe are concerned and a bit sad  â Tillerson  said. âWe have friends in Baghdad and friends in Erbil  and we encourage all parties to enter into discussion ... and all differences can be addressed.â
âIranian militias that are in Iraq  now that the fight against Daesh and ISIS is coming to a close  those militias need to go home  â Tillerson  said on Sunday in Saudi Arabia.
One of the closest groups to Iran within Popular Mobilisation  Asaib Ahl al-Haq  reacted to  Tillerson âs comment by saying it would be Americans who will be forced to leave Iraq.

Now complete the following example-
input: Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday to claim that Tennessee Republican helped ""give us"" the nuclear deal with Iran negotiated by President Barack Obama's administration. Earlier this month  he claimed that  Corker  is ""largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!""
 Corker  the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee   was in fact a vehement critic of the deal that emerged from international negotiations in the summer of 2015. After the deal was unveiled   he  wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post that ""Congress should reject this deal and send it back to the President.""
 Corker  plotted efforts to block the deal  banding with Republicans -- and even some Democrats -- in an attempt to block the deal.
The following month   Corker  did just that  joining with the bipartisan group to vote against the deal. A procedural vote to move forward a resolution to reject the nuclear deal fell shy of the required 60-vote threshold.
Even before that vote   Corker  helped push through the legislation that would ultimately grant Congress powers to review the deal  which the Obama administration contemplated approving without congressional oversight.
 Corker  said such an attempt would be ""a direct affront to the American people and seeks to undermine Congress' appropriate role"" in a March 2015 letter to Obama.
 Corker 's calls for congressional review of the nuclear deal that was still being negotiated in the spring of 2015 ultimately led to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act  which Obama ultimately signed despite initially opposing the measure.
That could be what White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was referring to on October 10 when she claimed: "" Sen. Corker  worked with Nancy Pelosi and the Obama administration to pave the way for that legislation and basically rolled out the red carpet for the Iran deal  and those are pretty factual.""
 Corker  defended the bill against that criticism in September 2015  noting that the legislation ""actually took power back from the president.""
""Without it  he could have unilaterally implemented the deal immediately. The President never would have been forced to submit the agreement to Congress and there would have been no review and no debate on this critical national security issue ""  Corker  said then.
Trump's criticism of  Corker  on the Iran deal is also curious given that Trump initially considered  Corker  as a candidate for vice president and later secretary of state  in large part due to his foreign policy chops.

Now complete the following example-
input: Watch the replay of  Benny Cunningham's  23-yard catch-and-run in the second quarter  and two things become clear.
Two   he  screwed up trying to do so.
Let's review: As  Cunningham  juked  his  way to the front right corner of the end zone   he  dove and extended the ball while Packers safety Marwin Evans shoved him out of bounds.  Cunningham  crashed into the pylon as the ball slipped free. Officials ruled  Cunningham  out at the 2-yard line.
""We're taught not to do it; unless it's fourth down  you don't reach the ball out  "" Cunningham  said. ""But  honestly  at the time  I wasn't thinking about that. I was trying to score a touchdown for the team.""
 Fox   under advice from  his  assistants who help with video reviews  challenged the ruling that  Cunningham  stepped out of bounds.
""Every indication we had was  he  scored  "" Fox  said. ""And  if anything   he  would be at the 1 or inside in the 1.""
So rather than have  his  offense line up with three tries from the 2-yard line   Fox  threw the challenge flag with hopes of being awarded a touchdown or  at worst  having the ball advanced a few feet.
But replays showed  Cunningham  lost possession before  he  hit the pylon  which  in the context of the video review  had unintended consequences.
Replay officials in New York decided  Cunningham  lost possession before  he  was out of bounds and before  he  hit the pylon.
""When I watched the review  I felt like they made the right call ""  Cunningham  said. ""Just a bad play on my part  but the refs got it right.""
To  Fox   the fumble wasn't as obvious.
""I think maybe on 50 times  like some people get to look at it  I think maybe you could see that ""  he  said. ""But on our look during the game  that wasn't really even discussed.""
Here's the thing  though:  Cunningham 's left foot dragged onto the sideline as  he  dove for the pylon.
Slow down the replay frame-by-frame and it's still nearly impossible to determine if  Cunningham  lost possession before  his  foot touched the sideline. What's more  as Dean Blandino  the NFL's former head of officiating  explained on Fox Sports  the determining factor should have been whether  Cunningham  was in contact with the ball while  he  was out of bounds and before  he  hit the pylon.
""Even if  he  doesn't have control  and  he 's just touching that loose ball with a foot out of bonds  that would make the play dead prior to it hitting the pylon  and it would not be a touchback.""
In that case  the Bears should have retained possession where  Cunningham  fumbled  the 2.

 ""People use their computers elsewhere and when the computers are done  they're loaded in containers and shipped off "" said Yumkella. ""We are working with agencies to look at how we deal with e-waste.""
 Yumkella acknowledged that IT companies must take an active role in mitigating e-waste but as the saying goes  it's important not to throw out the baby with the bath water.

input: The Daily Wire spoke with Michael Saltsman  the managing director of the Employment Policies Institute (EPI)  for clarification about the study. For background   Saltsman  received degrees in economics and political science from the University of Michigan  and was a field economist for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) from 2006-2009. In addition to his position at EPI   Saltsman  is the vice president of Berman and Company  a public relations firm.
According to  Saltsman   California is an ideal state in which to conduct a study like EPIâs because ""thereâs been a tremendous amount of minimum wage activity  both at the state level and then at the local level."" This didnât come without difficulties  however.  Saltsman  noted that the team had to account for the impact of other economic factors on certain industries  like apparel manufacturing  which has been harmed by factors other than rising minimum wages:
 Saltsman  stated that Macpherson and Even ""threw the kitchen sink"" at this issue  running ""models a number of different ways  accounting for different economic factors and trends that might have influenced the kind of employment trends weâre seeing absent a minimum wage."" Additionally  they looked at data ""county by county "" omitting material they believed was weak or possibly unreliable.
Those hardest hit by minimum wage increases tend to work for businesses that ""donât have a tremendous ability to absorb new labor costs "" according to  Saltsman . Restaurants  for example  tend to have incredibly narrow profit margins  and government-mandated wage hikes force these businesses to cut costs. Unfortunately  cutting costs often means letting go of ""less skilled or less experienced employees "" replacing them with machines  and self-service options.
The best thing to do with government-mandated minimum wages   Saltsman  says  is freeze them. That way  the issue would become ""less and less relevant"" to the conversation.
There are some who argue that a $15 to $20 an hour wage is necessary for basic survival.  Saltsman  counters this contention with a sobering fact: ""You can either have a $15 minimum wage  or you can have have the same number of jobs you have right now. You canât have both.""
 Saltsman  believes in a more targeted approach to helping the working poor:
A more generous Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)  suggests  Saltsman   is one way to help low-wage workers  as ""it has been more effective at reducing poverty than a higher minim wage  itâs better targeted  and creates an incentive to work."" Moreover  ""because itâs targeted through the tax code instead of a mandate on employers  you donât get some of the same unintended consequences"" that come with mandatory minimum wage increases.
 Saltsman  also rebutted the progressive argument that businesses â both small or franchise-based businesses as well as large corporations â should absorb the costs of wage increases  saying that such an idea is ""a pretty dramatic misunderstanding of how these businesses work.""
""Itâs not as if thereâs some pot of corporate cash that franchise businesses are able to tap into  "" Saltsman  stated  adding that franchisees essentially operate as small businesses:
While larger corporations might be better able to absorb certain costs  profit margins are still relatively narrow  according to  Saltsman . Additionally  itâs easy to forget that these companies employ thousands and thousands of people  and face overhead costs.
Regarding the seemingly excessive pay of company executives â something brought up frequently by progressive activists â  Saltsman  offered a rebuttal:
In conclusion  and to further illustrate the speciousness of the minimum wage argument   Saltsman  ran through a common scenario:

input: CNBC's Jim Cramer has been following the bull market in payment processing and the rise of digital transactions for a while  pounding the table on plays like Visa and PayPal.
But there are more ways to play the global cash-to-credit shift besides credit card companies and payment processors  so  Cramer  decided to analyze Global Payments  an international merchant acquirer that enables retailers to accept electronic payments.
""The stock of Global Payments has rocketed up more than 48 percent year to date  so good that  yes  I'm kicking  myself . I wish I had highlighted it earlier "" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""These guys own the client relationships in the payments business and they're the ones who set pricing. They also have some e-commerce  cross-border and gambling-related solutions.""
 Cramer  said Global Payments' outlook drastically improved when it bought Heartland Payment Systems in 2015 for $3.8 billion.
""Meanwhile  Global Payments is looking to expand internationally  "" Cramer  said. ""Right now  the rest of the world accounts for roughly a quarter of the company's sales. Asia  Europe  [the] Middle East  Africa  [and] Latin America is where the real growth is  so they're aggressively trying to take share overseas.""
Typically   Cramer  doesn't like to invest solely on earnings reports. But given Global Payments' bullish guidance  strategic partnership with Vista Equity Partners and e-commerce expansion   he  made an exception to  his  rule regarding the company's third-quarter earnings report on Nov. 8.
""I don't like to game the earnings reports  but if Global Payments delivers another good quarter next week and the stock gets dinged anyway  I wouldn't be surprised if you're getting another buying opportunity ""  he  said.

input: Mere months after being on the receiving end of one of the most stunning losses in presidential election history   former Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook  said thereâs a chance the former secretary of state could run again in 2020.
In an appearance Monday on MSNBC   Mook  was asked by host Greta Van Susteren âwhat are the oddsâ that  Clinton  will run for office again.
âIâm going to let  her  answer for that â  Mook  replied. âI think what happens right now  weâve got to get to the bottom of what happened in 2016  then we can start worrying about the next cycle. But weâve got to make sure that this cannot happen again in two years or four years to anybody else.â
 Mook  also refused to rule out a  Clinton  comeback in 2020 when asked Tuesday by veteran news anchor Dan Rather.
âI have no idea â  Mook  said. âYou genuinely would have to ask  her .â
In recent weeks   Clinton âs name has been linked to reports that  she âs eyeing a political comeback of some kind.
According to TMZ   Clinton  is considering running for New York City mayor â this  despite that a majority of likely voters in the deep blue Big Apple donât want  her  anywhere near city hall.
Still searching for  her  place in a politically frayed Democratic party   Clinton  announced last week at a St Patrickâs Day event in Scranton  Pennsylvania that  she  is âready to  you know  come out of the woods.â

That was the case for  Lea Giovanniello   59  the Virginia woman who found that resuming a full-time job in the technology sector two years ago required hitting the books for a new degree.
 Ms. Giovanniello  stepped away from a fast-track information technology job with Northrop Corporation. Over the course of more than two decades after  she  left   she  taught math and science in public schools and worked in various I.T. positions at embassies and consulates where  her  husband was posted with the foreign service.
When  her  children headed to college   she  decided to restart  her  career. âThe problem is that the tech field keeps moving on at a brisk pace  and my skills were out of date â  Ms. Giovanniello  said. âWhen I started looking at the job listings  it just felt so futile. I probably sent out maybe a dozen rÃ©sumÃ©s and never got back so much as an automatic response.â
 She  earned a master of science degree in computer forensics from George Mason University in 2014. Then  through FlexProfessionals  a part-time job staffing firm   she  was hired by Corsec Security  an I.T. security consulting company in Herndon  Va.  as a part-time computer security engineer.

The departure of  Fischer   73  represents a big loss of institutional knowledge and gravitas for the Fed at a time when many American institutions are sorely lacking in technocratic expertise.  Fischer  is considered the leader of a generation of prominent academic and professional economics  in part because  he  taught many of them at MIT.
"" He  is often referred to as the dean of central bankers  having taught most central bankers including former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and European Central Bank president Mario Draghi "" Shawn Baldwin  the chairman of AIA Group  wrote in a LinkedIn post. "" Fischer 's departure creates a vacuum not easily filled  adding to the uncertainty in monetary policy.""
Larry Summers  the Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary  dubbed  Fischer 's resignation ""the end of an era.""
Fischer  who was born in Zambia and later studied in London  started his career as an academic but became a policymaker at the World Bank and later the International Monetary Fund  where he rose to the role of first deputy managing director.  Fischer  then spent three years at Citigroup as a vice chairman before moving to Israel in 2005 to become the head of its central bank.  Fischer  returned to the US as Fed vice chairman in 2014.  His  term was not set to end until June 2018.
""The Fed and the international monetary system will be weaker for  his  departure from official responsibility "" Summers wrote in a blog post.
"" Stan 's has been a singular career ""  he  said. ""As an MIT professor he coauthored  with  his  close friend Rudi Dornbusch  the macro textbook that defined the basics of the field for a generation. With Olivier Blanchard "" the former IMF chief economist  ""he wrote the treatise that defined the state of the art for graduate students. His lectures were models of lucid exposition and balanced judgment. My view of monetary economics was shaped by my experience auditing his class in the Fall of 1978.""
Not everyone is complimentary about the arc of  Fischer 's career. To some  he represents the kind of establishment economics that led to financial instability and income inequality in many parts of the world.
During his time at the IMF   Fischer  became the face of austerity measures gone wrong. Many of his and the IMF's recommendations for drastic spending cuts during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s have since been widely discredited as having made matters worse.
""I see  Fischer  as to a large extent the embodiment of the conventional wisdom among macroeconomists and central bankers "" said Dean Baker  the director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research  a liberal Washington think tank. "" He  also  in the pre-crisis days  was very much associated with the deregulation of finance gang  although I think  he  has developed an appreciation of the need for regulation since the crisis.""
Indeed   Fischer  has spoken out rather strongly against efforts by Trump and Republicans to unwind most of the key regulations imposed on Wall Street after the crisis with the aim of preventing a repeat performance.
""We seem to have forgotten that we had a financial crisis  which was caused by behavior in the banking and other parts of the financial system  and it did enormous damage to this economy ""  Fischer  told CNBC in April  just as the president was signing an executive order aimed at what  he  said was ""reviewing"" Dodd-Frank.
""Millions of people lost their jobs  millions of people lost their houses ""  Fischer  said. ""This was not a small-time  regular recession. This was huge  and it affected the rest of the world  and it affected  to some extent  our standing in the world as well. We should not forget that.""
Baker says  Fischer  did a good job in Israel  where  he  managed the central bank from 2005 to 2013.
"" He  pushed down the value of the shekel  giving the country a large trade surplus  which allowed it to get through the Great Recession with little damage "" Baker said.
As for US monetary policy   his  tenure did not include much action on the part of the Fed  but  Fischer  has been erroneously worried about the threat of looming inflation since the start of  his  tenure.

The bizarre case â with many of the most sensational details initially released by  her  husband in an exclusive interview with ABC â has baffled police and set social media buzzing.

 Papini  disappeared Nov. 2 while jogging near  her  home in Shasta County  about 215 miles north of San Francisco.
 Her  husband found  her  phone and earphones near their home after  she  failed to pick up their children at daycare and called police. He was initially a suspect  but the sheriff said Wednesday that the husband passed a lie detector test and offered to take another.
Authorities also said a Detroit man Papini texted and planned to meet shortly before  her disappearance  has been cleared of involvement.
 Papini  was found alongside Interstate 5 in Yolo County  about 100 miles from  her  home.  Her  nose was broken and  she  was wearing a chain restraint around  her  waist.  Her  blonde hair had been cut to shoulder length and  she  had a ""brand"" burned into  her  right shoulder.
Investigators declined to discuss the ""brand"" in detail.  Papini  has said  she  was not sexually assaulted and has described  her  abductors as two women who took  her  at gunpoint.
Sheriff's Sgt. Brian Jackson said the sketches drawn by FBI artists are being released 10 months after  her disappearance  because of  Papini 's difficulty in recalling what  her  abductors looked like.

input: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Big banks keen to see bottom-line benefits from U.S. President Donald Trumpâs pledge to cut red tape are pinning their hopes primarily on  Randal Quarles   the new head of bank supervision at the Federal Reserve.
FILE PHOTO: U.S. Treasury Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Randal Quarles speaks during a Reuters sponsored panel discussion on the future of the U.S. housing foundations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in New York  July 19  2006. REUTERS/Keith Bedford/File Photo
 Quarles   a former Wall Street lawyer and private equity investor nominated to the Fed by Trump last summer and sworn in this month  will have the most influence in such efforts due to the central bankâs extensive financial oversight powers.
âNormally  when you get a new governor at the Fed  you donât see anything for a few months â said Wayne Abernathy  executive vice president at the American Bankers Association and a former colleague of  Quarles  at the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush.
âI think the expectations for  Quarles  are higher  because there was so much fanfare about the position.  He âs going to feel some kind of pressure to show something.â
With  Quarles  on board  banks and analysts expect the Fed to ease aspects of everyday examination and supervision  in particular reducing the number of post-inspection notices demanding fixes to technical compliance issues  ranging from sales practices to outsourcing contracts.
The Fedâs annual stress tests analyzing how a bank would cope with market shocks - known as CCAR - are another key area where  Quarles  is likely to quickly make  his  mark.
âNow that  Randal Quarles  is in place  what we expect is that in fairly short order there will be some modifications to the way the CCAR works  because that is something that can largely be done at the behest of supervision â Guy Moszkowski  managing partner at financial analyst firm Autonomous Research  told a conference on Tuesday.
Still  those who know  Quarles  believe  he  is well-suited in terms of experience and personality to navigate the Fedâs halls of power. They point to  his  success in helping to negotiate trade deals during  his  time at the Treasury.
â He  isnât the kind of person that bows to consensus â said the ABAâs Abernathy. â He âs the type of person who makes consensus.â

BuzzFeed News reporters in the US and Europe have been investigating various alleged facts in the dossier but have not verified or falsified them. CNN reported Tuesday that a two-page synopsis of the report was given to President Obama and  Trump .
The document was prepared for political opponents of  Trump  by a person who is understood to be a former British intelligence agent. It is not just unconfirmed: It includes some clear errors. The report misspells the name of one company  ""Alpha Group "" throughout. It is Alfa Group. The report says the settlement of Barvikha  outside Moscow  is ""reserved for the residences of the top leadership and their close associates."" It is not reserved for anyone  and it is also populated by the very wealthy.
The  Trump  administration's transition team did not immediately respond to BuzzFeed News' request for comment. However  the president-elect's attorney  Michael Cohen  told Mic that the allegations were absolutely false.
And  Trump  shot back against the reports a short time later on Twitter.

input: What is known for sure about  American military scientist Frank Olson  is that on November 28  1953  the bacteriologist and father of three plunged to  his  death from the thirteenth floor of the Statler hotel in New York City  not long after  he  was secretly drugged with LSD on the orders of  his  CIA superior. Whether  Olson  was pushed  or jumped  or was nudged into committing suicide remains unclear. But indeterminacy with a generous side of conspiracy is catnip to director Errol Morris  who has made either a 241-minute film or a six-part television series depending on where and how you plan to watch it  about the tragedy's long reach into  Olson 's family and America's secretive political culture.
 Olson 's death  and the murk surrounding its cause  cast a defining shadow over the life of his son Eric  whose endless quest to find out what happened that night has pre-empted all other endeavors. The blight spread around his family. His mother became an alcoholic with  the film implies  the active encouragement of one of her husband's colleagues. But Eric  now in his sixties  has arguably been completely derailed by the tragedy. He is the central focus of Wormwood  a hybrid blend of documentary and Cold War thriller that makes The B-Side  Morris's loving portrait of radical photographer Elsa Dorfman earlier this year  look almost straightforward.
Moving back and forth between the 1953 events and 1975  when a Rockefeller commission confirmed that an army scientist had been purposefully drugged with hallucinogens   Wormwood carries us from secret meetings at Deer Lake through the long tail of misery and obfuscation left by  Frank 's death  to Eric's pursuit of the truth all the way to the corridors of power.
In hushed and menacing re-enactments  Peter Sarsgaard  whose mild manner lends itself to all kinds of tonal nuance  charts the decline and fall of  Olson   a patriotic team player whose growing unease about his agency's secretive involvement in biological warfare overseas first worries his boss (a reptilian Tim Blake Nelson) and then moves him to seize the day and use his hapless employee as a guinea pig. By the time  Frank  arrives at the hotel flanked by ambiguously supportive colleagues  he's rapidly unraveling into a gibbering wreck.
Wormwood's breathless  hopped-up style harks back to Morris's 1988 The Thin Blue Line  which called into question a murder verdict and resulted in the release of a wrongly convicted suspect from Death Row. Here the noir markers are writ so large as to verge now and then on self-parody. Morris keeps returning the action to the hotel to act out different angles and competing versions of what happened to  Olson  that night. The hypothetical range between possible perps â  Frank 's boss  his friends  two wordless thugs in fedoras  a CIA allergist played by a sinister Bob Balaban â is narrow enough to make these scenes a touch repetitive if you're watching in one sitting. Certainly they underscore Morris's standing as a lifelong participant observer of American paranoia. For which  it must be said  there is undeniable fodder in the manner of Olsen's going  the secrecy surrounding his death  the ambivalent admissions the Rockefeller Commission along with a dwindling financial settlement that looks suspiciously like hush money to  Olson  and to Morris  and the merrily chuckling presence in old footage of two well-known knowns  Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney.
For all the formal beauty of the re-enactments  the most compelling scenes in Wormwood are the unembellished interviews that Morris â ordinarily an off-screen interlocutor with an appetite for the subtly leading question â is seen conducting across a table with Eric Olson  who waves his arms around with the befuddled intensity of a superannuated schoolboy as he tells his story. Articulate and charming  Eric is a talented collage artist who seems to have sacrificed career and significant relationships to his endless search for justice and truth  even after the case was officially closed and after he contacts investigative reporter Seymour Hersh  who first reported the drugging of  Olson  in The New York Times. Grandiose as always  Hersh insists that  he knows who murdered Frank Olson   but won't say for fear of compromising an anonymous source. We can't tell whether  he 's fibbing either.
A romantic view â and I wouldn't entirely put this past Morris â is that  Olson  is  like  his  interlocutor  an artist with a magnificent obsession that sustains  him  even when it's doomed to failure. But in Wormwood  he  emerges with enormous poignancy as a tragic figure  perpetually stuck in limbo like the father we see tumbling  over and over  to  his  fate.

input: This past Thursday  a new study conducted  Tom K. Wong   a political scientist at the University of California-San Diego  found that there are broad benefits for local jurisdictions that resist cooperating with federal immigration enforcement â they are safer in the aggregate and enjoy stronger economies. ""For the first time we're kind of seeing that crime rates are lower when localities stay out of the business of federal immigration enforcement  "" Wong  said.
 He  looked at federal data on immigration detainers  an ICE-initiated 48-hour hold on anyone identified as being in the country illegally. When someone is arrested and detained in a local jail  their fingerprints are cross-referenced with a federal database of undocumented immigrants. If the fingerprints match those of someone known to be in the country illegally  ICE can ask local law enforcement to hold that person as federal officials decide whether to start the deportation process. (There have been court battles over whether holding people for days without actual charges with these federal immigration detainer requests is in violation of the Constitution.)
 Wong  compared the the data from thousands of counties  those that ICE said did not honor detainer requests and those that did. ""We don't have to make up a definition of what a sanctuary locality is ""  Wong  said. ""We have ICE telling us what it thinks a sanctuary county is.""
On average  counties that did not comply with ICE requests experienced 35.5 fewer crimes per 10 000 people than those that did.  Wong  also found that counties that did not comply with detainer requests had higher household incomes  lower rates of unemployment  lower rates of poverty  and were less likely to have children under 18 in households receiving public benefits.
The crime numbers did not surprise  Wong . Research has shown that working with federal immigration enforcement made it harder for local police agencies to investigate crimes because witnesses and victims who were in the country illegally would be less likely to come forward if they thought they risked being detained and deported. It could be that sanctuary counties have immigrant populations who are more integrated into their social fabric and economies   he  said.
The research also revealed that smaller  more rural counties experienced the most significant impact from sanctuary policies on their crime rates (lower) and economies (stronger). Taken together   Wong  said  the net benefits to sanctuary cities would offset the impact of Trump's shame offensive on them. ""The ultimate effect is going to be minimal ""  he  said.

input: If Freeney cannot play Sunday  Robert Mathis  who usually plays on the left side of the defensive line  would probably move to the right  and Raheem Brock would assume Mathis's spot. Freeney had 13 1/2 sacks this season  and he and Mathis combined for 23 of the Colts' 34.
 The sports injury expert Will Carroll said that the standard definition of Freeney's injury  which has been described by the team as a Grade 3 sprain  meant that one of the ligaments in his right ankle was at least 50 percent torn. If this were the regular season  Freeney would probably miss several weeks  perhaps as many as eight.
 Freeney's game is predicated on speed  and he often employs a spin move to shed offensive linemen. The ankle may limit his ability to spin  if he can play at all.
 Freeney has been in Florida since Friday receiving treatment  and he is known as a fast healer. This season  he sustained what was described at the time as a torn quadriceps  which was expected to keep him out for up to a month. Seven days later  Freeney played.
 ""Dwight has Wolverine type of characteristics "" linebacker Gary Brackett said. ""All year  he's had strange things. Out 10 weeks  he's back in seven days. Dwight is doing everything he can to get back to this game. In my opinion  Dwight will be ready to go.""

 The Colts  who are usually secretive about injuries  have been unusually forthcoming about the specifics of Freeney's injury  but he was not available Monday night when the news media had limited access to the team. The Colts are scheduled to be at media day on Tuesday  but it is unclear if Freeney will be there. He is unlikely to participate when the Colts begin practice here Wednesday.

 Freeney's injury is a huge break for the New Orleans Saints  who at times struggled to protect quarterback Drew Brees. They would be less likely to leave a running back or tight end in to help left tackle Jermon Bushrod  freeing them to run pass routes.
 The Colts are 9-3 when Freeney has been out of the lineup.

Now complete the following example-
input: At one point during the two-hour premiere of Citizen Rose  her new E! docuseries   Rose McGowan  describes  her  life as âtrauma on top of trauma on top of trauma.â The series  which delves deep into McGowanâs upbringing in a cult and  her  Hollywood sex symbol status  as well as  her  alleged sexual assault and its aftermath  is far more substantial and devastating than standard E! programming.
Citizen Rose takes on a portion of one of the biggest news stories of 2017: the outing of Harvey Weinstein as an alleged serial rapist and sexual abuser. Weinstein  whose name and face is obscured in McGowanâs series  is one of the many characters on Citizen Rose who has become a household name. And while the series takes pains not to amplify Weinsteinâs infamy  it gives over its platforms to some of the heroes of the Weinstein saga. Ronan Farrow  the journalist who helped expose Weinstein with his New Yorker reporting  appears on Citizen Rose to thank  McGowan  for coming forward. Itâs one of the many moments in the series that successfully brings audiences behind the scenes of crucial moments in the #MeToo timeline. We learn that  McGowan  was one of the first women to talk to Farrow  as  he  recalls  âWhen I first talked to youâ¦at the end of that interview  when I said  are there others  and you said  âI know there are others â I then went out and started calling women.â
Farrow goes on to compare Weinsteinâs decades of alleged abuse and network of spies to a detective novel  and  McGowan  explains the intense loneliness of being called crazy and paranoid for years because nobody believed that the producer was actively attempting to intimidate and silence her. After âtwenty years  with everyone saying âyouâre not seeing what youâre seeing ââ Farrowâs reporting finally  publicly confirmed what she had been privately alleging in the years since she was assaulted. She concludes  âIâm not paranoid  itâs reality.â
For  McGowan   doubts about how her narrative is being consumed are clearly secondary to the joy of being heard after decades of deafening silence. If thereâs one defining emotion in Citizen Roseâa series thatâs really about emotional as they comeâitâs relief. After years and years of being either ignored or misunderstood   McGowan  is finally being validated and encouraged to share  her  truth  as  she  sees it. The resulting two hours of truth-telling is probably more sincere than anything E! has ever aired. Itâs almost as if the network canât come to terms with the fact that they have a truly gripping  meaningful  timely subject on their hands  leading them to resort to unnecessary filler materialâinexplicable interludes of interpretive dancing and bright flashing lights.
Still  when  McGowan  speaks  itâs well worth the wait. While  she  insists that  she  has been attempting to tell  her  story for years  itâs only in recent months that  McGowan  has become legible. Before   she  was alternatively seen as a sex symbol or a loose cannon; narratives that  McGowan  convincingly argues were forced upon  her . Citizen Rose is as much about the âopen secretâ of Harvey Weinsteinâs serial sexual abuse as it is about the way that women in Hollywood are deliberately seen but not heard.
Early on in the episode  we go through the timeline of McGowanâs assault.  She  explains that  âWhen it happened to me I was in the middle of my second movie for him. I had a 10 a.m. meeting in the restaurant. The maÃ®tre dâ said heâs not ready yet  they want you to go up to his officeâ¦I get up there  two male assistants come outâ¦I had an MTV crew following me that morning  it was supposed to be  Rose McGowan   a day in the life. I turn to the cameras right when I was about to go into the hotel  and I say  âI think my life is finally getting easier.ââ
In a larger conversation about sexual-assault survivors  itâs important to point out that  McGowan   a famous white actress  comes from a place of immense privilege. Still  the history that she recalls is a painful one  from a childhood spent in the Children of God cult to what she calls âthe cult of Hollywood.â McGowan went from being a young star with all of the opportunities in the world to an assault survivor working on a movie for her alleged rapist. Over decades  just trying to do her job  she was consistently forced to interact with Weinstein  and made to remember that he was the one in power. McGowan describes turning on the TV âto see Gwyneth Paltrow giving him humanitarian awards â or going to the movies and seeing his name. âI saw him all the time â she breaks down to her mom in one scene. âI didnât get to be me for 17 yearsâ¦youâre literally trapped in the tiniest town in the world.â

 Schmidt's selection comes more than 10 months after Obama declared cyber security a priority and ordered a broad administration review.
 A senior White House official said Obama was personally involved in the selection process and chose Schmidt because of his unique background and skills. Schmidt will have regular and direct access to the president for cyber security issues  the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the selection process.
 At the same time  cyber experts and potential job candidates have complained that the position lacks the budgetary and policy-making authority needed to be successful. Schmidt will report to the National Security Council and closely support the National Economic Council on cyber issues.
 Schmidt's selection suggests that economic and business interests in the White House held more sway in the selection process.

input: Mario Casciaro  who was sent to prison for 26 years for the murder of his teenage co-worker  only to be freed after the conviction was reversed   is now seeking millions of dollars in damages from those who brought the case against  him .
It took two trials before  Casciaro  was convicted in 2013 of the unusual murder by intimidation charge in the presumed killing of 17-year-old Brian Carrick. In what had been â and now remains â one of McHenry County's most mysterious cases  Carrick disappeared in 2002 after being seen at the Johnsburg grocery store where he and Casciaro both worked. His body has never been found.
Authorities contended that Carrick was selling pot for  Casciaro  and owed him money.
A third co-worker  Shane Lamb  testified at both trials that  Casciaro  told him to ""talk"" to Carrick about the debt. Lamb said he confronted Carrick inside a produce cooler at the grocery store and punched him  knocking him unconscious. Lamb testified that  Casciaro  told him to leave the store and that he would take care of the body. Authorities said Carrick's blood was found in and around the cooler  but  Casciaro  has denied having any involvement.
Lamb  facing a lengthy sentence in an unrelated drug case  agreed to testify against  Casciaro  in exchange for immunity in Carrick's death.
 Casciaro   now 33  was released from prison in 2015 after an appellate court ruled that the state's case was improbable and Lamb's testimony did not match the physical evidence found at the scene.

input: Jameis Winston  won the Heisman Trophy the following year while leading the Seminoles to the national championship.
After one more season   he  was off to the NFL as the first pick in the draft by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The success was hardly a surprise  born out of an innate self-assurance.
"" He  always wanted to race.  He  thought  he  was the fastest person on the team  knowing  he  was the slowest.  He  was competing in everything  thought  he  had the best hands  thought  he  could cover anyone "" said Rhodes  who'll be defending  Winston  on Sunday with the Minnesota Vikings. ""I'm like  'Bro  you're just an all-around athlete  huh? Running a 4.8  huh?'""
No  speed is not part of  Winston 's elite skillset.  His  official 40-yard dash time at the NFL combine in 2015 was 4.97 seconds .
Just about everything else is. With the Vikings uncertain this week about quarterback Sam Bradford's status  having started Case Keenum at Pittsburgh because of an injury to Bradford's left knee  the Buccaneers are clearly  Winston 's team.
""Jameis is Jameis "" Rhodes said. "" He 's confident in everything  he  does.""
 Winston  will face an accomplished defense in Minnesota  with the Pro Bowl cornerback Rhodes one of the standouts.
"" His  size and speed combination is amazing. But at the end of the day  just like at Florida State  we're going to go out there and compete ""  Winston  said.
Vikings running back Dalvin Cook  a freshman in  Winston 's final season with the Seminoles in 2014  recalled a certain read-option play where  Winston  would hand  him  the ball and then try to hustle in front to block for  him .
"" He 's just a guy who built up confidence.  He  carries  himself  like a leader  which  he  is "" Cook said.

Worries over organized crime and Bulgariaâs relative poverty have stood in its way.

That will not in itself overcome resistance from wary member states.  Borissov âs finance minister said frustration had grown to such an extent that he was ready to call their bluff and apply for the next step toward the euro zone in order to force them to publicly explain their objections.
Warm words from the visitors from Brussels did not drown out opposition at home to the government.  Borissov  dismissed out of hand accusations of shrinking media freedom and  his  minister in charge of the EU presidency denounced a website run by critical journalists covering the issue as âhate speechâ and âfake newsâ.

Now complete the following example-
input: Ben McAdoo  clearly is going to go down swinging.
âUntil I had all the information  I was going to err on the high side of trusting the player  protecting the player â  McAdoo  said Wednesday.
Giants generally agree with  Ben McAdoo  suspending Janoris Jenkins
McAdoo  however  canât be so removed from reality not to understand that there was a better way to handle that situation than lying that Jenkins was âexcused for personal reasons â when he in fact hadnât even spoken with the man. And  McAdoo  also has to understand that when he stands there on Wednesday and makes no apology for his premeditated mistake  it is implicit that he most certainly would do it again.
Of course   McAdoo  hopes  he  wonât have to repeat this song and dance  but then again   he  admitted suspending two players in three weeks was ânot something that going into the season Iâd ever thought Iâd have to do â so who knows? Bad things usually hit in threes  anyway  right?
And  McAdoo  alluded to the fact that  he  is still not confident  he  controls the narrative of  his  team  as much as  he  desperately tries. When asked if  he  would discipline Eli Apple and Paul Perkins â who also missed Mondayâs practice due to travel reasons but had called  unlike Jenkins  to alert the coach â  McAdoo  answered:

Sure enough  Apple later was asked if  he  was being disciplined and said: âSomething like that.â
Now  say this for McAdooâs indefinite suspension of Jenkins  which defensive captain Jonathan Casillas said is expected to only last one week: Whatever Jenkins did to earn it  it was bad enough that not a single Giants teammate came anywhere close to defending  him  on Wednesday.
Some actually went as far as using Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie  suspended in Week 6 for walking out of the facility  as an example of a much less severe transgression than whatever Jenkins did. Casillas actually said âhopefully thereâs no spill-over in emotions coming from (Jenkins) or Coach  McAdoo  next weekâ when the corner returns  so it sounds like there could have been a heated confrontation or exchange  even if by phone.
Strong safety Landon Collins defended  McAdoo  and flat-out said the head coach hasnât lost the team and agreed with the coachâs comment that DRC and Jenkins are âisolated incidents.â
âWe have not lost respect for him â Collins said of  McAdoo . âWe continue growing with him and trying to be a great team and stay(ing) together  because our back is against the wall right now. We canât fight against each other. If we fight against each other  things are definitely going to go bad.â
âWhether I support  Ben McAdoo  or not  heâs the head coach and I think heâs doing what he thinks is best for the team â Casillas said. âAnd I want Jackrabbit to be here  everybody does  but he violated the team rule and coach had the call.â
 McAdoo  continued to find ways on Wednesday  though  to confound with contradictory or unintelligible rationalizations  including  his  argument for why  he  feels  he  hasnât lost the defensive backs room: âWe had a good day of practice â  he  said.

input: India Landry  a 17-year-old Windfern High School student  said she was suddenly expelled Oct. 2 by the schoolâs principal   Martha Strother   after  she  refused to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance. Although India said she hasnât stood for the pledge for years  it wasnât until she was in the administrative office during the daily pledge recitation that  Strother  noticed and took issue with her silent protest.
âThe principal said  âStand up or youâre out of here 'â she added  alleging  Strother  told  her  if  she  didnât leave the school grounds within five minutes   she  would call campus police and have India Landry removed.  Her  mother  Kizzy Landry  was called to come pick her up  without any further details given to her.
âThey just assumed it was about race â  she  told the Houston Chronicle. âThe assistant principal told  her   âAll the other African-Americans are standing  so you should stand  too.'â
According to KHOU  Kizzy Landry finally spoke with  Strother  in a recorded phone call  and  Strother  told  her  unequivocally that India would not be allowed to come back unless  she  stood for the pledge  even though Cy-Fair ISDâs policy is to allow students to sit during the pledge as long as they provide written permission from their parents to do so.
After a weeklong expulsion and a local news story that brought attention to the matter  the school lifted the expulsion and allowed India back to school with a note from  her  mother  but the Landry family and their attorney believe the damage is already done and are seeking an undisclosed amount in damages for mental anguish.
â She  was damaged. You canât just throw people out of school â said the familyâs attorney  Randall Kallinen. âI donât know yet if  she âll be held back.â

Wasnât this Hitlerâs dream too? A country with a master race of white people?

Tragic truth: In one year  Donald J. Trump alone  has turned the White House into a sinkhole of ignorance  bigotry and hatred against anyone who isnât a white man in a suit. True   he  used to welcome Steve Bannon  who showed up looking like an out-of-work gym teacher  but thatâs because  he  thought Bannon had his back. Ooops.
OK  Iâm not being fair.  The Donald  does allow people of color to show up on occasion  and  he  did appoint brain surgeon Ben Carson as HUD secretary even though  his  qualifications for housing secretary are that  he  lives in a house.

Nearly 200 others who once walked the halls of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School flooded the restaurant Tuesday evening in the Georgetown area of Washington  D.C. to raise money and support students and faculty at the school.

input: Osman Aslam  has tried the apps.
On Minder   he  wrote  he  enjoys hiking  going on long drives and spending time with  his  family. On Muzmatch  another option for Muslim singles   he  described  his  ideal partner as well-educated  ambitious and funny.
So on a recent winter day  armed with a pale purple dress shirt and purple tie   he  flew 300 miles south from  his  home in Stockton  Calif.  rented a car and booked a hotel room.
 Osman Aslam  at  his  workplace in Stockton  Calif. (Brian Flaherty/For The Washington Post)
Because practicing Muslims typically shun dating or sex before marriage  the banquets offer a possible  if imperfect  solution to what young Muslims in America say is an irksome problem: âItâs really hard to meet someone in this culture â  Osman  said.
 Osman Aslam  at  his  workplace in Stockton  Calif. (Brian Flaherty/For The Washington Post)
âI keep telling  her  to get marriedâ
In  Osman âs view   his  parents are an example of the kind of couple that âjust grew to love each other.â
But even though they have lasted â raising three boys in northern California and climbing from the bottom rungs of the economic ladder into middle class prosperity â theirs is not the marriage  Osman  wants.
 Osman  wants to fall in love.  He  wants to marry  his  best friend.  He  wants that person to be a Muslim and a Pakistani American â but not a Pakistani.  He  wants someone like  him  who was born and raised in the United States to immigrant parents  someone who is âon the same page.â
Three-quarters of American Muslims are immigrants or the children of immigrants  and in many ways  Osman  is emblematic of an American minority at a generational crossroads.
 Osman  considers  himself  âfairly religious.â  He  does not drink or smoke;  he  does not date â  he  âwouldnât know where to begin â  he  says; and  he  sees Islam as central to  his  life and identity.  He  has never really known  his  parentsâ Pakistan  but  he  values  his  heritage and shares their desire to carry it on.
 Osman âs parents think  he  is too picky  and they have been laying on the pressure since  his  older brothers got married.
 He  felt optimistic about this matrimonial banquet.
âWow â  he  thought  surveying the room. âIâm going to meet a lot of people.â
The other singles had come from all over: California  Maryland  Texas and Canada. Each pairing had three minutes to talk â barely enough time to accomplish anything   Osman  soon realized â but many had come carrying the same frustrations about the search.

 Schmidt's selection comes more than 10 months after Obama declared cyber security a priority and ordered a broad administration review.
 A senior White House official said Obama was personally involved in the selection process and chose Schmidt because of his unique background and skills. Schmidt will have regular and direct access to the president for cyber security issues  the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the selection process.
 At the same time  cyber experts and potential job candidates have complained that the position lacks the budgetary and policy-making authority needed to be successful. Schmidt will report to the National Security Council and closely support the National Economic Council on cyber issues.
 Schmidt's selection suggests that economic and business interests in the White House held more sway in the selection process. Schmidt  president and CEO of the Information Security Forum  a nonprofit international consortium that conducts research in information security  has served as chief security officer for Microsoft and as cyber security chief for online auction giant eBay. He was reportedly preferred by Lawrence Summers  director of the economic council. A good format for the titel can be the simple subject + object + verb.

 ""Around 85 to 90 percent of our (environmental) concerns have been addressed. The process of building the Navi Mumbai airport can start today. With these compromises we are fully on board and will ensure speedy work "" Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh told the media here.
 The Navi Mumbai airport  which has been planned some 30 kilometers away from the current Chattrapati Shivaji airport in Mumbai  had been a contentious issue because of its environmental impact due to its location. But  the Indian Environment Ministry finally cleared the project.
 Claiming that the plans for the airport have been modified so that one river instead of two will be diverted  the minister said: ""River Gadhi would not be diverted to make way for the airport and added that 161 hectares of mangroves would fall under Navi Mumbai airport.""

input: Ali Bongo will be sworn in as Gabon's president this week  succeeding his late father  after a top court upheld his victory in hotly disputed presidential polls.
 The oil- and timber-rich West African nation's Constitutional Court confirmed Bongo won the election prompted by the death of his father Omar Bongo Ondimba  who had ruled the country for 41 years.
 Chief Justice Marie Madeleine Mborantsuo confirmed Bongo as the poll winner with 41.79 percent of the ballot.
 Interim president Rose Francine Rogombe will formally hand over power to Bongo as part of the ceremony at the presidential palace in Libreville. The organisers have also planned a military parade and fireworks display.
 But the secretary general of Ali Bongo's Gabonese Democratic Party  Faustin Boukoubi  said he had ""a feeling of full satisfaction.""
 ""Right and the law have prevailed "" he said. ""All Gabonese have a president who will get down to all the problems of the Gabonese people and make Gabon into an emerging country.""
 If reaction to the court's ruling passes without incident  Ali Bongo still faces a difficult start to his presidency  observers say.
 However  according to an official of Mamboundou's UPG (Union of Gabonese People) party  the country's ethnic mix will severely test Bongo's ability to win consensus.
 ""No-one is prepared to negotiate with him "" said the official. Bongo  who comes from a minority ethnic group ""will have lined up against him the Fang  the Punu  and Nzebis. The country is going to be ungovernable.""

input: The speculation about President Donald Trump's mental status is ""very dangerous "" and the 25th Amendment was not made to be invoked when parties don't agree about a president's ""emotional makeup  "" Harvard Law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz  said Monday.
""I have railed against the criminalization of political difference  "" Dershowitz  told Fox News' ""Fox & Friends"" program.
Yale Professor Bandy Lee earlier this month briefed several congressional Democrats and one Republican earlier this month over her concerns over the president's mental state  and  Dershowitz  said her comments that  he  is dangerous and may need to be restrained from action are in themselves dangerous.
""Imagine how dangerous that would be  and you know  psychiatrists are notoriously bad at predicting violence "" said  Dershowitz .
""Remember  what they are looking at are things they knew about since he was elected president ""  Dershowitz  added. ""I didn't like what I saw necessarily so I did what you do in a democracy  you vote for the candidate you prefer  I preferred Hillary Clinton. I knew about her  I knew about him. I made a balanced judgment. You don't lock them up. You don't put them in mental hospitals if you don't agree with them. So dangerous to democracy.""
""[It] is designed for when somebody has a stroke or somebody is unconscious  perhaps what happened when President [Woodrow] Wilson was president "" said  Dershowitz . ""He had a serious stroke. It's not designed for differences about a person's emotional makeup.""
In addition   Dershowitz  said that politically  the 25th Amendment likely would not be invoked as the vice president would have to do that  and if the president disputed the matter  then it would have to be voted for by two thirds of both houses of congress.
""It would happen only if any president  I'm not talking about a particular one  had a major psychotic break "" said  Dershowitz . ""Look  we once had a secretary of defense his name is [James] Forrestal  he jumped out of the window of the Walter Reed Center. He thought the communists were coming after him.""
""Oh  by the way  one of the things [Lee] talks about that's a symptom of his mental illness is that he recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel "" said  Dershowitz . ""So did the majority of the Senate and majority of the House and so did I support that. Am I getting locked up next?""
 Dershowitz  on Monday also talked about the importance of allowing dissent on college campuses.
The way to solve the issue is to fight back   Dershowitz  added  while blaming college administrators for the unrest.

input: Sirleaf  70  acknowledged before the commission in February that she gave up to $10 000 to a rebel group headed by Charles Taylor. Sirleaf said the money she sent while an expatriate was meant for humanitarian services and that she was never a member of the group  the National Patriotic Front.
 Information Minister Laurence Bropleh said Monday evening if the public had had any dissatisfaction with Sirleaf's involvement with Taylor at the time  they would have voted against her in 2005.
 In 2005 the Liberian people knew that President Sirleaf had contributed $10 000 to Taylor's movement  Bropleh said.
 An AP correspondent and others who covered the Liberian war can recall no humanitarian works by Taylor and his fighters  especially in the first months of the war when tens of thousands of refugees were fleeing across the borders to Ivory Coast and Guinea  where they were helped by international and government agencies.
 Then  most atrocities were committed by Doe's forces and Taylor was welcomed as a liberator fighting a barbaric dictatorship.
 ""In defense of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf  she never hid the fact that she was curious about Taylor and what he was all about "" said Huband  who drove with Johnson Sirleaf on her first trip to meet Taylor in May 1990. ""A lot of people supported the idea of Doe being ousted and there had been so many attempts  and they all were foiled  at least one with the help of the American government  which continued to support Doe despite his brutality.""
 ""I never had the impression that Sirleaf supported Taylor  certainly not after it became clear his troops were out of control "" Huband said. ""Certainly there was no way she could predict the kind of atrocities that would be committed (by Taylor's fighters) ...""

input: Over at Lawfareblog  theyâve gotten a hold of a cache of e-mails from inside the FBI from the immediate aftermath of the president*âs firing of director James Comey. These are significant in a couple of ways: first  the release of these e-mails can fairly be seen as a counterstroke against the president* and his congressional dogsled team  and second  they give a pretty good look at the kind of chaos that Comeyâs firing occasioned in the Bureauâs rank and file.
When President Trump fired  James Comey  as FBI director last May  the special agent in charge of the Detroit field office  David Gelios  wrote an email to  his  staff: â I just saw CNN reporting that  Director Comey  has been fired by President Trump. I have no notification from HQ of any such thing. If I receive any information from HQ  I will advise. Iâd ask all to stand by for clarification of this reporting. I am only sending this because I want everyone to know I have received no HQ confirmation of the reporting. I hope this is an instance of fake news.â
Oh  and the e-mails also provide further evidence that Sarah Huckabee Sanders is an utterly truthless drone whose daily briefings are unworthy of serious attention. At the time  Comey  was fired  the White House line  peddled by SarahHuck and by the vulgar talking yam for whom she works  was that agents in the Bureau had âlost confidenceâ in Comeyâs leadership. (At the time  the president*  of course  would undercut his own outrageous lie by telling Lester Holt that he canned  Comey  over the Russia thing.) These e-mails show a sense of outrage among the grunts in the field offices on whose behalf Sanders and Trump presumed to speak.
After the president fired Comey there was some uncertainty about whether Comey  as a former FBI employee  would have to pay his way home from LAX or would be able to use the directorâs plane. NBC recently reported that an irate Trump called McCabe a day after the firing asking why  Comey  had been permitted to return to Washington on an FBI plane. McCabe indicated that he hadnât been consulted about the use of the plane but  had anyone asked  he would have approved the request. Thanks to one of these emails  we now have a small window into what went on at the FBI at the time. On May 11  Gregory Cox  assistant director of the Critical Incident Response Group  emailed all of the Critical Incident Response Group thanking âall who were involved in efforts to bring home former Director Comey from Los Angeles on Tuesday evening.â The apparent defiance may be subtle  but it is unmistakable. Cox may not have known that his email dealt with a point the president had personally raised with the acting director  but he thanked his people for doing the right thing by  Comey  irrespective of politics  he  was surely aware of in a generic sense.
I donât minimize how thoroughly  Comey  bungled at the end of the 2016 presidential campaign. If what  he âs doing now is atonement  thatâs only right.  He  has a lot for which  he  should atone. But the sense of dislocation in these e-mails shows where the current propaganda war against the FBI first took root. Itâs where the water first went muddy.

input: BAGHDAD -- Weeks after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in the spring of 2003  as parts of the capital were still smoldering  American soldiers and diplomats turned to men like Hassan Shama and Omar Rahman Rahmani in their quest to plant the seeds of representative democracy.
 In Baghdad  Iraq's capital  they held impromptu neighborhood caucuses to appoint district and neighborhood advisory councils. The local government bodies were given no official charter  lawmaking power or public budget. In the years that followed  as the capital became a bloody battleground and the country descended into near-anarchy  council members were among the U.S. military's staunchest allies. They provided information about extremists  offered insight into Iraqi society and gave American-imposed security measures a veneer of Iraqi legitimacy.
 ""They used to come to our meetings  and they had all the power in their hands "" Rahmani said. ""Now we don't have any power.""
 Rahmani visited the Bush White House last year as part of a delegation of local Iraqi politicians. When he got his turn to shake George W. Bush's hand  he said  he told the president that democracy in Iraq was not taking root.
 Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's government and the Baghdad provincial council  also led by Shiites  seemed uninterested in working with the local councils  Rahmani said he told Bush.
 ""Every party is working in Saddam's shadow "" Rahmani said  referring to ousted President Saddam Hussein. ""Everyone wants to be a Saddam. Everyone wants power in their own hands.""

input: Villanova guard  Mikal Bridges  reacts after blocking a shot during the second half Tuesday. (Julie Jacobson/Associated Press)
NEW YORK —  Mikal Bridges  was not even a top 80 recruit coming out of  his  suburban Philadelphia high school in 2014. In the one-and-done era of college basketball   he  was the opposite when  he  arrived at Villanova that summer and was forced to redshirt  his  freshman season because  he  simply wasn’t ready. When  he  was finally prepared to play as a relatively unknown reserve on the Wildcats’ national championship team the following season   his  older teammates chided  him  for  his  finesse tendencies in the lane.  He  preferred layups over powerful dunks.
Pray for the Gonzaga basketball team Nothings wrong with them  it’s just that  Mikal Bridges  just ended  their  program pic.twitter.com/ywUj8Hhirx — Stri:(a (@StrikaNation24_) December 6  2017
More people stood after the sequence  and a large group of fans started chanting “Mi-kal Bri-dges” briefly at one end of the arena. It ended after a few seconds  but what  Bridges  did Tuesday night — scoring a career-high 28 points to go along with six rebounds and two blocks — will likely reverberate across college basketball for some time. ESPN analyst Jay Bilas said on the game’s telecast that  Bridges  had made a “case for first-team all-American.” On Twitter  former Villanova guard Josh Hart claimed his former teammate would be a first-round pick  and some even boldly projected that  Bridges  would be drafted ahead of Michigan State star Miles Bridges.
That wave of noise didn’t seem to faze the soft-spoken Mikal Bridges as he took the podium afterward  where he said all the right things and told the story about the older veterans in the program who have challenged him to attack more over the years. One of the primary concerns for Villanova entering the season was finding a replacement for the graduated Hart and Kris Jenkins  who were pillars in the program for four seasons. Villanova has another experienced star in 6-2 junior point guard Jalen Brunson  who finished with 12 points Tuesday  as well as redshirt junior Phil Booth  a Baltimore product who scored 20 points on 9-for-14 shooting as Gonzaga turned in one of its worst defensive performances of the past two years.

input: It's been estimated that  American actress Meghan Markle’s  wedding to Prince Harry  scheduled next May 19  will translate into a £500 million boost for the British economy .
The ""Meghan Effect"" may give her soon-to-be sister-in-law a run for her money. Fortune magazine predicts that ""Meghan Markle's 'Midas Touch' Could Match Duchess Kate's.""
According to the New York Times: “There is a blog —  Meghan ’s Mirror — that chronicles  her  every style choice. Vogue has a piece online titled “ Meghan Markle’s  Stealth Shopping Style Is All the Black Friday Inspo You Need ” while InStyle crowed “The Nordstrom Black Friday Sale Has Discounts on  Meghan Markle’s  Favorite Denim Brand.”
Fashion Editor Vanessa Friedman of the New York Times saw  Markle ’s choice of dress as a reflection of the ""completely different kind of royal""  she  will be and  her  opportunity to further modernize the monarchy.
“ She  is perfectly aware that everything  she  wears is going to be under the social media spotlight  so  she  might as well make it work for  her  ” Friedman writes. “Even the smallest gestures are going to have a heightened import as the royal family adjusts to a modern identity. Far beyond Britain and the formal royal watchers  many have a special investment in this particular story and how it gets told.”
""Harry and  Meghan  should not be lulled into a false sense of security "" Sykes warns. ""There is already a significant undercurrent of hostility to  Meghan  circulating in some sections of the British establishment. Blame the blinding glare of new love if you will  but Harry and  Meghan  seem to be  if not heading for the rocks  at least grazing the odd sandbank.""
As photos and video clips of  her  most recent public appearances as the prince’s fiancé show   she 's already a main focus of attention for photographers and cameramen. Such was the case during the spectacle of the royal family's annual Christmas parade between Sandringham estate  the queen’s private residence  and the nearby St Magdalene Church  for their traditional service.
After Harry and  Meghan  went to Monte Carlo to celebrate the new year with friends  the comparisons with Grace Kelly  the Hollywood star who married Prince Rainier of Monaco to become the admired Prince Grace  were all over the media.
 She  also was compared to Princess Charlene  the South African former Olympic swimmer who married Monaco's Prince Albert II.
It's rumored that Meghan and Kate have a good understanding -  Markle  and Harry stayed with the Cambridges  who have a house in the Sandringham estate during the Christmas celebrations - and royal experts assume that Kate will help guide  Meghan  through the royal paces.
Despite  her  current popularity and seeming ease facing the challenges of royal life   Markle  will need all the support  she  can get.
“After all  the 36-year-old is set for a daunting transition ” the Telegraph predicts. “When  she  marries Prince Harry  Meghan will be trading an acting career and a life of relative freedom for one of public duty  reserve and near-ceaseless waving – and that’s notwithstanding the private pressures of remembering if and when to curtsy to her in-laws.”

input: SEOUL (Reuters) - The light-grey suit and matching tie that  North Korea’s Kim Jong Un  donned for  his  New Year’s address was likely carefully calculated to project a softer  more relaxed image to go with  his  surprise offer for talks with Seoul.
Departing from  his  usual black or navy suits  Kim gave  his  televised speech wearing black-rimmed glasses and slicked back hair  speaking fluently and rarely looking down to read as  he  raised the possibility of sending a delegation to the upcoming Winter Olympics in South Korea.
“In this New Year’s address  North Korea seems to have taken great pains with the image portrayed by Kim Jong Un ” said an analysis by the state-run Korea Institute for National Unification after  Kim ’s speech.
“The change from the previous dark Maoist suits to a softer toned grey Western-style suit likely aimed to underpin peace  which  Kim  stressed in  his  address ” the institute said.
It added that  Kim ’s style “reflected a relaxed state of mind” that likely resulted from  his  previous announcement that North Korea had achieved its nuclear ambitions.
After a year dominated by fiery rhetoric and escalating tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons programme   Kim  declared Monday that  his  country was “a peace-loving and responsible nuclear power” and called for lowering military tensions and improving ties with the South.
 Kim  also said  he  was open to dialogue with Seoul  prompting South Korea on Tuesday to propose high-level talks between the two countries on Jan. 9 at the border truce village of Panmunjeom.

Analysts said the North Korean leader’s speech on Monday showed more confidence compared to previous years  his old habit of swaying from side to side while making speeches nearly undetectable. In his first New Year’s address as North Korea’s leader in 2013   Kim  frequently sounded short of breath  his voice wavering from time to time.
 Kim  made  his  maiden public address in April 15  2012 at a parade marking the centenary of  his  grandfather’s birth. This year  there was none of the uneasiness that marked that speech and  his  subsequent public addresses.
 His  voice   his  hair shaved on the side  as well as  his  light-colored Western-style suit and glasses  were also reminiscent of  his  grandfather  Kim Il Sung  according to defectors and analysts. Kim Il Sung had a more gregarious and popular image than  Kim Jong Un’s  reclusive father  Kim Jong Il.
 Kim Jong Un  has embraced New Year addresses as a chance to outline  his  policies and rally the North Korean people. Last year   he  used  his  speech to declare that North Korea was in the “final stages” of perfecting an intercontinental ballistic missile.
Kim Gun-hee  a consultant on image making and leadership  said the grey suit may have been designed to deflect some of the negative global attention  Kim ’s nuclear and missile tests have prompted.
“When we advise clients who are in tough situations or are surrounded by unfavourable rumours  we tell them to wear either white or grey ”  she  said.
“In the study of color psychology  white imbues innocence while grey tends to take attention away from you.  Kim  may have felt some pressure from being at the centre of global focus and turned to grey after sticking to dark tones for several years.”

input: Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan  delivers a speech and talks about President Trump at the Watergate Hotel in Washington. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)
Controversial firebrand Minister Louis Farrakhan Thursday invited journalists to a televised  135-minute sermon to Donald Trump to clean up Americaâs injustices  seeming to side with Trump as a fellow tell-it-straight ally who calls out everyone from Pope Francis to the media.
âGod has him here!â  the Nation of Islam leader  said  referring to Trump during the morning event at the Watergate Hotel ballroom  which was filled to capacity with more than 500 people  mostly Nation members and other  Farrakhan  supporters. âWhat did you say   Farrakhan ? Do you think God is not interested in who is president of the United States of America?! Especially when itâs the time of evil?â
The talk was billed as a news conference because reporters were invited  but no public questions were taken after the address. And it was called a message to Trump. It was laid out as a detailed history of American wrongs  from slavery to war to hypocrisy  delivered to an unexpected and unlikely president whom  Farrakhan  painted as perhaps best able to address such problems.
The fiery talk focused on injustices against African Americans and Muslims and seemed to single out a longtime favorite target of the religious leader: Jews. Running through his story of America  he said Jews were the ones who stopped African Americansâ initial progress. About 40 minutes into the talk  an assistant brought out a large poster of a Jewish star and an advertisement for a decades-old Nation of Islam-published book subtitled âHow Jews Gained Control of the Black American Economy.â The poster stood beside  Farrakhan  for the rest of the talk.
 Farrakhan âs comments about Jews  gays and lesbians and white people prompted the Southern Poverty Law Center  which tracks hate and extremist groups  to label the Nation of Islam a hate group. The Nation was formed in Detroit in the 1930s. Its theology entailed  in part  black superiority over whites. But the 84-year-old Farrakhan has also been held up as a civil rights leader by his followers and supporters.
âFor black youth  this puts their struggle in perspective â for them to see they are the victims of circumstances â said Ishmael Muhammad  national assistant minister to  Farrakhan . âThey can redirect their anger and turn it into something more constructive.â
But nothing and no one were outside  Farrakhan âs critique  with targets from Presidents Kennedy  Clinton  Nixon and both Bushes to his fellow African Americans and Muslims as well.
Trump was the stated audience for  Farrakhan âs plea  but  he  was both hero and villain in the story.  He  portrayed Trump as a warmonger who âtore up the White Houseâ to eliminate any trace of the countryâs first black president. âYou hate our shadow â  Farrakhan  said.
But time and again  Farrakhan  seemed to offer a fig leaf to Trump  using a Trump-like worldview suggesting hidden enemies and conspiracies keeping the decent American down.
âWhat kind of a man is [Trump?] That he would argue with a man that every other president of the United States would go to Rome and kiss the ring! But not Donald Trump. The pope says  âHeâs wrong because heâs building walls.â But what about the pope himself   Farrakhan  asked  noting the wall around the Vatican âthat walls you off from the poor!â
After alleging the U.S. government was behind the 9/11 attacks   Farrakhan  segued to a shared enemy. âWhen Trump talks about fake news  he knows what heâs talking about! You say youâre the Fourth Estate  Iâd say youâre in a hell of a state. You canât say what you know is true  unless it passes the muster of your bosses.â
To some   Farrakhan âs core message of fighting for black self-empowerment and equality is worth the conspiracy theories and controversy. The crowd was dotted with local African American figures  including former NAACP leader Benjamin Chavis â one of the organizers of the historic Million Man March in 1995 â prominent D.C. Pastor Willie Wilson and others  including Anthony Shahid  a Nation member and St. Louis activist close to the family of Michael Brown  who was killed by police in Ferguson  Mo.

In the report the man alleges that in 1985  when he was 15 and  Levine  was 41   Levine  held  his  hand in a ""prolonged and incredibly sensual way"" while they were alone in a car  the Post reports. The following year  Levine  began to touch the teenager's genitalia and masturbate in front of  him . The ensuing sexual contact lasted for years  according to the allegation.
 Levine  also served as a mentor to the teenager  wrote a college recommendation essay  and gave  him  tens of thousands of dollars of cash  the Post writes.
There were ""hundreds of incidents "" the alleged victim said. The man  who says he is straight and that he was not aroused by any of their interactions  wrote in the report that he was ""confused and paralyzed"" by  Levine 's actions.
The New York Times has also seen a copy of the police report  and confirmed the stories contained in the report with the alleged victim and with one of his relatives. The Times also notes that rumors of sexual misconduct have swirled around  Levine   unconfirmed  for years.
The Times reports that  Levine  invited the victim to audition as a conductor  and told him that he should focus on ""other talents"" â while continuing to promise to ""raise [him] 'special' "" in some way. The young man first told a relative about the abuse in 1993  the newspaper writes; he reported it to police in 2016  after realizing that  Levine 's behavior had negatively affected his life.

Leahy’s  deputy  Executive Vice-President Kiran Rao  had been identified as  Leahy ’s successor earlier this year  but his appointment to one of the industry’s most visible jobs was never confirmed as  Leahy ’s retirement slipped towards end-year.
Whoever replaces  Leahy  will face the job of repairing poor morale and absorbing the CSeries without upsetting demand for bread-and-butter larger jets offered by Airbus and Boeing.
But his replacement is unlikely to enjoy the same latitude as  Leahy  in negotiations or influence over industrial moves.

input: According to court documents filed on Saturday by the CBI   branch deputy manager Gokulnath Shetty  issued a series of fraudulent Letters of Undertaking â essentially guarantees sent to other banks so that they would provide loans to a customer  in this case a group of Indian jewelry companies.
 Shetty  did so using the bankâs SWIFT system to log in with passwords that allowed  him   and in at least some instances a more junior official  to serve as both the person who sent messages and as the person who reviewed them for approval  according to court documents and interviews with bank executives.
 Shetty  is now in custody and  he  has not publicly responded to the allegations. Calls to a cell phone listed for  his  wife on court documents were not answered.
âWhen you are flooded with customers in the morning  with 101 demands  you look for shortcuts â  he  said. âYou do somebody elseâs work  somebody else does your work. You are not working in an ideal situation.â

input: By 1996   Muhammad Ali  didn't really need to supply us with more reasons to cheer for  him .  Ali   suffering from Parkinson's disease  had long proven  himself  to be one of the most iconic athletes in the world  and even if  Ali  didn't end up lighting the torch on July 19th  1996  we'd still have plenty of moments to treasure both in and out of the ring.
But as it happens  it was  Ali  who took the torch from Janet Evans  hands shaking  but proud as ever. The man who fought in some of the greatest fights in boxing history  was the subject of some of the most iconic images of the 20th century  and who changed this country in ways we're still feeling to this very day  had one more moment of greatness for the world to witness.

But as former NBC executive Dick Ebersol told Sports Business Journal last year  the head of the Atlanta committee for the games  Dick Payne  put up a fight  saying  ""Where we're from  he's perceived as a draft dodger."" Hometown hero Evander Holyfield was the local pick to do the honor  but Ebersol countered that  Ali  didn't dodge the draft: "" He  lost three big-money-earning years. But he didn't run away from the country. He didnât go to Canada. He was willing to stand on his principles.""
It took four months to convince Payne and the committee that  Ali  was the right person for the job  four months for them to agree that a person who Ebersol figured  ""outside of perhaps the pope"" was ""the most beloved figure in the world.""
Of course  eventually the committee agreed  and what happened when the champ and 1960 gold medal winner was handed the torch was truly a moment that is so perfect that it defies any sports cliche you could toss at it. A reminder  once again  why  Ali  was  and always will be the Greatest of All Time.

The victim testified Wednesday in a preliminary hearing that  Moran  invited  him  over to  her  Dansville home and sexually assaulted  him   the Lansing State Journal reports.
The teen said  he  first started communicating with the teacher outside of the classroom on Snapchat.
""At first it was just normal ... asking how I was doing ""  he  said.
 The boy  said they ""started talking more in a sexual manner"" and exchanged nude photos. The teen also testified that  he  would sometimes eat lunch in  Moran 's classroom.
During  his  spring break in April   he  said  Moran  invited  him  over to  her  home.
 Moran  allegedly told the teen not to park near  her  house because  she  didn't want the neighbors seeing the car.
When he arrived at the home  he said  Moran  took him to  her  basement ""man cave "" disrobed and kissed him.
 She  then took him upstairs to  her  bedroom where the teen says  she  sexually assaulted him.
 Moran  invited the teen back to  her  house a day or two later and they had sex again   he  said.
The relationship was reported in August after the teen told  his  girlfriend what happened.
According to the Lansing State Journal   Moran  was bound over for trial on three felony counts of third-degree criminal sexual conduct involving a student and one misdemeanor charge of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct involving a student.
 Her  arraignment date is set for Nov. 8.  She  could face up to 15 years in prison.

Now complete the following example-
input: Guan Weili  the 47-year-old founder   didnât start out with grand ambitions.  He  simply was struck by the paucity of treatment when working as a clinician at Wenzhou Mental Hospital   his  first job on graduation in 1987.
Trained in general practice at Wenzhou Medical University   Guan  was assigned arbitrarily to work at a mental hospital. Psychiatry hasn't been a popular area of specialization in China  but the career suited  him  well. The hospital was near  his  home  and  he  met  his  wife  Wang Lianyue  a nurse working in the same unit. Today she is his top lieutenant as the company's executive director and general manager. Together they own a third of Kangning.
Sensing both need and opportunity   Guan  started  his  own hospital in 1996  initially with 20 beds  encouraged by a local government with a reputation for fostering the freest brand of capitalism in China. Soon  he  bought land in then suburban Wenzhou for future growth.  His  wife joined two years later  when an expanded hospital was built.
Later the city of Wenzhou's freewheeling underground banking network would help  him  cover cash-flow needs  though at usurious rates.  He  had no choice. Chinese law bars hospitals from pledging their facilities as collateral for bank loans.
No matter how desirable the room services  the ultimate goal is to reduce  not prolong  the stay. Thanks to enhanced efficacy of treatment   Guan  says  his  patients now each spend on average 47 days in hospital  compared with the Chinese industry's 60 days and as long as 90 days just a decade ago. ""With better medications and therapies come better results and shorter therapy sessions ""  he  says.
Still  mental patients need longer and more intensive care than most physical hospitalizations. Even one with mild syndromes might stay one or two weeks   he  adds. That calls for more beds. On average  for every 100 outpatient visits a day  400-bed capacity is needed  according to  Guan --the reverse of the standard hospital formula. Wenzhou Kangning now averages 150 at its owned units.
Private psychiatric care in China grew at a compounded 20% annually to 2014  largely to treat common disorders like anxiety  depression  substance abuse and psychosis. Among the key hubs is Guangzhou  a megacity of 13 million where  Xinhua News reported  68 out of every 100 citizens suffer insomnia. Elsewhere  large corporate employers such as Foxconn offer 24-hour hotlines and suicide prevention counsel.  Guan  sees the upsurge as a by-product of the nation's fast economic growth  likening it to Japan's experience at a similar stage of development.
Specialized mental hospitals have been around since the Chinese revolution in 1949  many drawing on care houses left behind by Christian missionaries. A drawn-out reform process began only 15 years ago   Guan  says.

input: The vote makes Rangel just the 23rd member of the House to be censured  and the first in nearly three decades.
 Rangel and his allies had pleaded for mercy  arguing his transgressions  which included failure to pay income taxes and misuse of his office to solicit fundraising donations  deserved the more lenient punishment of a reprimand. But that effort failed  267-146.
 Still  talking to reporters after leaving the House floor  Rangel's old pugnacity returned as he denounced the vote as partisan.
 ""I am confident that when the history of this has been written  people will recognize that the vote for censure was a very  very  very political vote "" Rangel said.
 Rep. Zoe Lofgren  D-Calif.  the chairwoman of the ethics committee  said in the past  censure had been used for members who had used unparliamentary language and that Rangel had promised voters that Democrats would run the most ethical Congress in history.
 ""We need to hold ourselves to a higher standard "" Lofgren said. ""Mr. Rangel himself has acknowledged that.""
 Rangel's long battle over the ethics charges has transfixed New York City's political establishment  and set off speculation about how long he will remain in office. Several Democrats are eyeing the seat  but no major figure dared to challenge Rangel last fall  when he easily won re-election.

input: Trump  tweeting Sunday  wrote about the ""Uranium to Russia deal"" in a string of criticisms about the Clintons and Democrats.
Trump has discussed the agreement on numerous occasions â including an October 2016 campaign event when he said that  Hillary Clinton  ""gave Russia 20% of American uranium  and  you know   she  was paid a fortune.""
Trump's renewed focus on  the deal  is seen by many as a distraction tactic amid the Robert Mueller-led investigation into possible Russian collusion with members of his campaign during the 2016 election.
Trump claims Clinton  Dems are the ones who colluded with Russia
Here's the full story about the uranium deal â and how the Clintons are involved.
President Obama had final approval of  the deal . (JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images)
With help from  Bill Clinton 's connections  Canadian mining tycoon Frank Giustra in 2005 was able to secure a key uranium mining deal in Kazakhstan for his company UrAsia Energy. Months later  according to a New York Times report  Giustra donated more than $30 million to  Clinton 's foundation â donations that remained secret for years. Uranium One obtained UrAsia Energy in 2007.
In 2008  then-President George W. Bush's administration reached a nuclear cooperation agreement with Russia  but  the deal  was withdrawn from Senate consideration after Russia attacked Georgia.
Through  the deal   Rosatom â Russia's nuclear agency â gained a majority stake in Uranium One  and with it control of nearly 20% of the U.S. national uranium extraction capacity.
Under  the deal   no uranium at U.S. mines can be exported  except for some uranium yellowcake  which was later returned to the United States.
As Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  among other members of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  would have input over the deal. But the approval rested with Obama   not Clinton .

People connected with Uranium One donated $145 million to  the Clinton Foundation   much of  it  before the deal was reached  and  Bill Clinton  also got $500 000 from a Kremlin-linked bank for a speech in Moscow.

input: Jay Gruden  winced as  he  eased  himself  onto a leather sofa at Redskins Park this week. The Washington Redskins coach had strained a calf muscle while running   he  explained at the outset of a mid-season interview  and it was sore.
 Gruden  looked up and laughed as the 6-foot-5  319-pound Scherff  grinning at  his  joke  trudged past  a portrait of toughness lumbering toward the teamâs weight room.
âThereâs not one player on this team that I donât enjoy messing around with and talking to â  Gruden  said. âTheyâve all got great personalities. Theyâre great kids.â
âAfter a bad practice or a bad game   he âs the first one to let you know youâre not getting it done;  Jay âs gonna let you know itâs not good enough â explained Foster  currently on injured reserve  in a telephone interview. âBut  he âs also the first  after a great game or a great play  to say  âYou looked great out there! You guys are playing your hearts out!â  Jay  keeps it real with you. And  he  actually cares about you as a person.â
If Gruden makes it to 2018 in Washington   he âd become the first head coach to last five seasons under Redskins owner Daniel Snyder.
âKnock wood!â  he  chuckled when this was pointed out. âI still have to get to next season!â
Could it be that the seemingly imperturbable  Gruden  has a shot?
Asked about his demeanor earlier in the season   Gruden  confessed  âIâm a happy guy.â
In doing so   Gruden  broke the unspoken creed of old-line NFL coaches that greatness is one step removed from misery â that the price of postseason glory  for an NFL head coach  was physical and psychological well-being in the form of ulcers  anxiety and lack of sleep.
âIt can be miserable â if you have people around you [whom] you donât like to go to work with  and thatâs players and coaches  included â  Gruden  said of the job. âIâve got a great coaching staff  great training staff. And when Dan [Snyder] comes by  we shoot the [breeze] a little bit. Itâs fun.
For the Redskins to be 4-4 after so much off-season turnover is something of a surprise.  Gruden  lost both coordinators (offensive coordinator Sean McVay left to coach the Los Angeles Rams; defensive coordinator Joe Barry was fired after 28th-place performances in consecutive seasons). Snyder fired general manager Scot McCloughan the month before the NFL draft. The offense lost 2 000 receiving yards with the departure of DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon. All but one defensive assistantâs jobs turned over. And team president Bruce Allen failed to deliver the long-term contract for quarterback Kirk Cousins that he promised would be easily handled.
âI just think this day and age in pro football  you have to be ready to adjust and make changes â  Gruden  said. âYouâre never going to see the same roster one year to the next. Sometimes itâs coaching; sometimes itâs personnel.â
When McVay had the job   Gruden  said  the two retreated to their private offices  scripted plays independently  compared notes and âcame to a happy mediumâ on the best approach weekly.
This season   Gruden  is spreading the workload among  his  assistants: offensive line coach Bill Callahan  running backs coach Randy Jordan  tight ends coach Wes Phillips  wide receivers coach Ike Hilliard.
The number of injuries to the offensive line has made consistent offensive production even more challenging. The running game has struggled  and Cousins hasnât had time to throw deep consistently. So  Gruden  has fashioned a running game of sorts from a heavy diet of screen passes that Thompson has turned into big gains. The Redskins currently rank 14th in total yards  averaging 343 yards per game.
âWe might only rush for 70 yards one game but might throw screens for 150 â  Gruden  noted. âThere are different ways to skin a cat in a running game. Itâs easier said than done to go out there and just run the ball. Bruce [Allen] and Dan [Snyder] want to run the ball all the time; thatâs the old Joe Gibbs way. I get that. Iâd love to hand the ball off; it makes it easier for everybody.â

input: These terrifying tales sent me looking for a book I had been meaning to read for quite some time. My former Washington Post colleague  Brian Krebs  left the newspaper in 2009 to dedicate  himself  to a blog on cybersecurity: KrebsOnSecurity.com. Out of  his  work and research came âSpam Nation: The Inside Story of Organized Cybercrime â From Global Epidemic to Your Front Door.â
But  Krebs  has made a background believer out of me.
âThe Internet of today is truly a transformative communications and learning tool that radically enriches the lives of billions each day â  Krebs  writes. âYet  never before in the history of the Internet has this medium been more fraught with snares and neâer-do-wells looking to fleece the unwary.
With our spam filters and the constant drilling to not open suspicious emails  weâve been lulled into a false sense of security   Krebs  says.
âThe spam ecosystem is a constantly evolving technological and sociological crime machine that feeds on itself â writes  Krebs . âThus far  the criminals responsible for unleashing this daily glut of digital disease are doing a stupendous job of overwhelming the security industry.â
 Krebs  spends a lot of time introducing the major and minor spam players. Itâs like a Jason Bourne movie but with criminals who donât shoot at folks (well  some do). They instead fire out malicious spam infecting tens of millions of computers and  as a result  rake in millions of dollars.
Waiting for you at the end of the book is a very resourceful chapter on how to protect yourself. Youâll be safer following  Krebs âs three rules for online security:
Even if you donât buy âSpam Nation â make  Krebs âs blog regular reading.  His  reporting will frighten you. It does me. As  he  writes  âthose who endeavor to remain blissfully unaware of their role in becoming part of the solution will almost invariably end up becoming part of the problem.â
Iâm hosting an online discussion about âSpam Nationâ at noon Eastern time on Nov. 2 at washingtonpost.com/discussions.  Krebs  will join me to answer your cybersecurity questions.

Rick Santorum told Breitbart News Daily host Raheem Kassam on Monday  “Anyone who votes again this bill ” referring to the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill  “and says  ‘I’m still for repealing Obamacare ’ they’re a liar because they had a chance to repeal Obamacare  and they didn’t.”
 Santorum  also went into detail on recent changes to the bill to gain more support  arguing that any alleged addition of money to sway some senators is a minor issue  at best.  He  said the adjustments were simply to ensure that if Washington is going to block grant the Obamacare money  it needs to do so proportionately and fairly. That is what any last-minute changes are meant to bring about.
 He  also cited welfare reform under Bill Clinton as an instance of successful government reform of a major program  while pointing out that the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal is the first real effort to take on Obamacare.  Santorum  said all previous votes to repeal Obamacare were actually “fake” votes  as it was known the bills being voted upon never had a chance of becoming law.
 Santorum  also said that Graham-Cassidy will get enough votes in the House if the Senate passes it  making it the first and only legitimate effort to repeal Obamacare.

input: Jared Kushner  President Donald Trumpâs son-in-law and White House adviser  has had  his  security clearance downgraded  Politico reports.
 He  has been downgraded from SCI (sensitive compartmented information) access to Secret level  according to the publication.
All other White House aides working on high-level interim clearances also had their access downgraded  according to a memo reportedly sent to staffers on Friday. Earlier that same day  Trump said he would leave it up to his chief of staff  John Kelly  to decide what access  Kushner  should have.
âGeneral Kelly respects  Jared  a lot and General Kelly will make that call â Trump said at a joint news conference with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the time.
 Kushner  no longer receives the Presidentâs Daily Brief  a top-secret roundup of global issues compiled by intelligence officials.  His  access to the highly classified intelligence briefing has been cut off in the past few weeks  sources told Reuters.
 Kushner  is reportedly accepting the decision and âwill not ask for special permissionâ from the president  according to CNN.
Kusher has the vague title of senior adviser. Throughout  his  career at the White House   he  has been assigned a wide-ranging portfolio on an array of highly sensitive issues â solving the Israeli-Palestinian crisis  keeping the U.S.-Mexico relationship afloat  and heading up diplomacy with China  for example.
âThis action will definitely impact  Kushner âs ability to cure the world of all ills but not necessarily prevent  him  from doing aspects of  his  job â Mark Zaid  a lawyer who specializes in national security law told HuffPost in an email. One of the most significant effects of  Kushner âs clearance downgrade is no longer having access to the Presidentâs Daily Brief  according to Zaid.
Government officials who perform the type of high-level diplomacy  Kushner  is tasked with doing typically get access to highly sensitive raw data about the players involved in the negotiations. Without the highest-level security clearance   Kushner  will have to get a âreduced and more limited versionâ of those background briefings  said Brad Moss  also a national security lawyer.
âIt really undermines  his  ability to do the work  he âs supposed to be doing and makes  him  into more of a figurehead â Moss said.
 Kushner  will also lose access to the National Security Agencyâs intercepted communications  Ned Price  a former White House and CIA official  wrote on Twitter.
âWhether or not  he  couldâve been successful before   he  no longer can be an effective Middle East mediator â Price wrote.
 Kushner âs colleagues have an incentive to block off  Kushner âs access to highly classified information. If they arenât careful  they could lose their own clearances â or even face criminal charges  said Moss.
Ultimately   Kushner âs ability to do  his  job will depend on how strictly people around  him  restrict  his  access to sensitive meetings  calls or documents  Zaid wrote.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders refused to answer questions regarding  Kushner âs security clearance during a press briefing earlier Tuesday. Last week  Sanders said  Kushner  would continue the work  he  has been doing whether or not  he  has full security clearance.

Gaudy numbers â 31 of 46 for 314 yards and one touchdown â were offset by three interceptions that resulted in a paltry passer rating of 66.8.
No  but  Trubisky  displayed  his  worst judgment of the season â or at least since  his  first start Oct. 9 â when  he  forced the ball into double coverage trying to hit Dontrelle Inman that resulted in a Cutleresque interception in the end zone.  He  never saw safety Quandre Diggs step in front of Inman for a gift. âTis the season  apparently.
âI just lost  him  in my vision ââ  Trubisky  said. âIâve got to throw the ball away so we can get a field goal.ââ
 Trubisky âs first pick came when  he  sailed a pass over Kendall Wrightâs head that cornerback Darius Slay caught before going out of bounds  one of two interceptions by âBig Playâ Slay. Interestingly  the errant throw occurred on a slow-developing play-action pass out of the shotgun with  Trubisky  rolling left  when  his  accuracy tends to become more iffy. Slay also identified  Trubisky  as a young quarterback who locked in on his receivers  which  Trubisky  disputed.

 Schmidt's selection comes more than 10 months after Obama declared cyber security a priority and ordered a broad administration review.
 A senior White House official said Obama was personally involved in the selection process and chose Schmidt because of his unique background and skills. Schmidt will have regular and direct access to the president for cyber security issues  the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the selection process.
 At the same time  cyber experts and potential job candidates have complained that the position lacks the budgetary and policy-making authority needed to be successful. Schmidt will report to the National Security Council and closely support the National Economic Council on cyber issues.
 Schmidt's selection suggests that economic and business interests in the White House held more sway in the selection process.

 ""Around 85 to 90 percent of our (environmental) concerns have been addressed. The process of building the Navi Mumbai airport can start today. With these compromises we are fully on board and will ensure speedy work "" Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh told the media here.
 The Navi Mumbai airport  which has been planned some 30 kilometers away from the current Chattrapati Shivaji airport in Mumbai  had been a contentious issue because of its environmental impact due to its location. But  the Indian Environment Ministry finally cleared the project.
 Claiming that the plans for the airport have been modified so that one river instead of two will be diverted  the minister said: ""River Gadhi would not be diverted to make way for the airport and added that 161 hectares of mangroves would fall under Navi Mumbai airport.""

input: Sofia Vergara  said the âModern Familyâ cast had âa lot of funâ filming in Lake Tahoe for the highly-anticipated new season that premieres tonight.
For one scene in particular that was shot on a boat   Vergara  said it âwas so hard to keep a straight faceâ because of the outlandish way  her  co-star  Eric Stonestreet  was dressed trying to shield himself from the sun.
âItâs like  âYou look like a geisha with a nun 'â  Vergara  said on âGood Morning Americaâ of Stonestreetâs outfit for the show. âItâs confusing. It was really crazy and Ed [OâNeill] couldnât stop laughing.â
âThe weekend we were there  there was a big fight in Vegas and we were all watching it â  Vergara  recalled of their time in what  she  called âamazingâ Lake Tahoe. âThen Julie loves bicycling and hiking. She always has time for that. I do some shopping. We like hiking together. We donât get to do that when weâre in L.A. Weâre all working and go home. But when weâre trapped in a hotel in a city  it makes us all be together and itâs a lot of fun.â
 Vergara  is also keeping busy with the launch of a new underwear line  EBY  which  she  said  she  is passionate about because of the brandâs partnership with the Seven Bar Foundation. A portion of the sales from the underwear company will go to the foundation for helping empower women to start their own businesses.
âEvery sale we make  10 percent is going to go to a woman that is going to be able to open  her  own business â  she  said of the subscription underwear line. âWeâre going to microfinance businesses all over the world  so that women can have their own thing  their own money. That was super-important for me when I was young as a single mom. I wanted to have my money and my own independence  and we want to give them that.â

input: On November 6 Breitbart News reported that  the gunman  Devin Kelley   passed a background check in 2016 to acquire  his  rifle. CNN quoted a law enforcement official who observed that  Kelley  âdidnât have a disqualifying criminal history when he filled out the background check paperwork at the storeâ in San Antonio.
Questions immediately aroseâhow did  Kelley  pass a background check  considering the fact that  he  had a domestic violence charge?
According to NPR   Kelley  was arrested in 2012 and âwas court-martialed for assaulting  his  then-wife and stepson.â  His  conviction in that case âdisqualified  him  from legally possessing a firearm.â  He  entered a plea deal for a lesser sentence  but one which was still enough to prohibit  him  from firearm possession under federal law. Nevertheless   his  arrest and conviction were not reported to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)  thus  he  was able to buy firearms.
NPRâs Tom Bowman said  âThis was mishandled by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico  where  Kelley  was serving when he was arrested. An investigation is now underway  and the Air Force is taking it very seriously  said the source.â

input: Steve Rannazzisi  didn't sound like someone putting on a show.
""I was sort of the party starter of Merrill Lynch ""  he  said in an interview in 2009. ""Until our building got hit with a plane.""
Without tears or theatrics   Rannazzisi  went on to explain that  he  was working on the 54th floor of the south tower of the World Trade Center on the morning of Sept. 11  2001.  He  felt the impact of a plane ramming into the first tower and ran outside to see what was happening. When the building began to crumble  ""I just started f_ing booking it ""  he  told Maron.  He  stopped just in time to turn around and see the second tower collapse.
When  he  and  his  fiancÃ©e â who was supposed to be working in the towers but was still on the subway when the planes hit â got home  they decided to leave the city for Los Angeles  a decision  Rannazzisi  often credited with jump-starting  his  career.
""I still have dreams of like  you know those falling dreams ""  Rannazzisi  said.
But  Rannazzisi 's account was no more real than those dreams. This week  the New York Times uncovered that the 37-year-old comedian  a star on the FXX show ""The League "" was working several miles from the site of the attacks that morning. Confronted with this story  he issued an apologetic series of tweets Wednesday.
 Rannazzisi  isn't even the most famous person to have publicly pretended to have survived 9/11.
In fact  to Angelo J. Gugliemo Jr.   Rannazzisi 's account sounded a lot like one he had heard from his friend Tania Head  the former president of the World Trade Center Survivors' Network. Like  Rannazzisi   Head spoke of working for Merrill Lynch on the morning of 9/11. Like  Rannazzisi   she said she had a fiancÃ© who worked in the towers (though he was killed in the attacks).
Like  Rannazzisi   Head wasn't telling the truth.
Though some lies have obvious tangible benefits for the teller  the impulse that drove Head  Rannazzisi and others to make up their stories is more complicated. Neither Head nor  Rannazzisi  wrote books or sought compensation from a survivor's fund. Neither gained any kind of obvious advantage for framing themselves as a victim.
Head  who still hasn't admitted to fabricating her story despite evidence that she was taking classes in Spain on that day  won't say why she made it up. According to his tweets   Rannazzisi  doesn't know.
Psychologist Christopher Chabris  who studies false memory  said that  Rannazzisi 's story isn't a case of someone mistakenly remembering something that didn't really happen. It's about inserting one's self into a narrative that's already getting a lot of sympathy.
The psychology behind that explanation for liars is as complicated as the stories they tell. Neither  Rannazzisi  nor Head is quite a pathological liar â there's no evidence that they have a chronic compulsion to tell falsehoods  other than this one big one. Neither do they appear to have been suffering from false memories (as some psychologists argued about Brian Williams  who inaccurately claimed to have been shot down while reporting in Iraq).  Rannazzisi  tweeted that  he  wished for many years  he  could take back  his  story  knowing that it was untrue.

input: At the end of a school safety roundtable event at the White House on Thursday   President Trump  was asked by a reporter if  he  thinks  his  proposal to âhardenâ schools with armed guards and armed teachers will put  him  at odds with the National Rifle Association  which spent $30 million to elect  him .
 The president  indicated  he  doesnât expect any problems.
âI donât think Iâll be going up against them  I really think the NRA wants to do whatâs right â  Trump  said. âI mean  theyâre very close to me  Iâm very close to them. Theyâre very very great people  they love this country â theyâre patriots. The NRA wants to do the right thing.â
It makes sense that  Trump  doesnât foresee conflict with the NRA  given that  he  was speaking at the end of an event where  he  parroted the pro-gun talking points used earlier in the day by NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre.
Consider some of the pro-gun buzzwords used by LaPierre during  his  speech earlier Thursday at CPAC. NPR put together an analysis looking at LaPierreâs comments in comparison with what  Trump  said hours later.
CNN put together a video of  Trump  parroting LaPierreâs lines.
The NRA has made clear that it opposes new regulations on semi-automatic firearms. During the White House event on Thursday   Trump  suggested that more guns are the solution to mass shootings.
While  Trump  clings to the NRAâs talking points and resists legislative gun control efforts  a number of major companies are taking the opposite approach.

input: The executive  Eric Alexander   not only obtained the medical records of the victim  who was an Uber customer in India  but shared them with other executives  according to Recode  which first reported  his  firing. Uber fired  Alexander  on Tuesday over the medical records issue  the New York Times reported.
Uber confirmed to Business Insider that  Alexander  is no longer employed by the company  but declined to comment further on the circumstances.
 Alexander  obtained the victim's medical records and showed them to Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and Emil Michael  the company's VP of business  according to the report.  Alexander  continued to carry the records around for a year until other executives obtained a copy of them and destroyed  his  copy of the records  Recode reported.
It's unclear how  Alexander  obtained the medical records. Photos online show that  Alexander  was in Delhi in December 2014 for multiple days of police questioning.
Despite Uber's top executives allegedly knowing  Alexander  had obtained the rape victim's medical records   he  remained employed by the company for the last three years.
On Tuesday  Uber announced the initial results of an investigation into charges of harassment and other complaints at the company. Although  Alexander 's acquiring of the victim's medical records was among the 215 complaints investigated  he wasn't among the 20 people the company said it had fired in response to them  according to Recode.

input: Anders Fogh Rasmussen  the former NATO chief and adviser to Ukraine's leader  said  Russian President Vladimir Putin  ""must be laughing right now"" at how successfully  he 's undermined Western democracy.  He  said the lack of answers from the Trump administration would be seen as a sign of weakness that  Putin  would exploit.
"" He 's achieved much more than  he  could have ever dreamed of when it comes to undermining the credibility of Western democratic institutions ""  Rasmussen  said Thursday in an Associated Press interview. ""When  he 's watching the ongoing discussion here in Washington  I think it's unbelievable for  him  that  he  could achieve that much for a very modest investment in whatever  he  might have invested in interference in the election or whatever.""
The former prime minister of Denmark   Rasmussen  joined a growing chorus of Russia critics expressing exasperation that an Oct. 1 deadline came and went without new penalties to punish Russia for interfering in the U.S. election. A law Trump signed in August requires the administration to produce a list of individuals linked to Russia's defense and intelligence agencies. Anyone who does business with those individuals could then be hit themselves with U.S. sanctions.
""So far  nothing has happened from the administration side "" Rasmussen said. Still  he said that just the threat of U.S. weapons potentially flowing to the Ukrainians had affected  Putin 's deliberations about Ukraine in a positive way. He said he believed  Putin 's recent proposal to send U.N. peacekeepers to eastern Ukraine reflected the Russian leader's ""attempt to find a way out of all of this.""

Now complete the following example-
input: Her opponent   City Council Member Mary Norwood   is a conservative-leaning independent who has supported both Republicans and Democrats in the past  and  she  has the support of what Republican Party infrastructure actually exists in Atlanta.  Norwood  is also white  while Lance-Bottoms is African-American. The last white candidate to win the mayorâs race in Atlanta was Sam Massell in 1969 . The state party has come out with heavy-handed attack ads deriding  Norwood  as a Republican  a signal to the cityâs voters of who they are backing. Their argument is laid out on a website called MaryTheRepublican.com   where they point out she has paid some Republican consultants as part of her campaign  that she refused to back Jon Ossof in his congressional race  and that she implied to a local Republican Party group that she is an independent because Republicans canât win in Atlanta.
But some of the polling shows that the race is a dead heat. A survey released late Friday night showed  Norwood  with a 6-point lead â and significant crossover support among African-American voters and Democrats.
Many political activists in Atlanta cite Reed as the reason some progressives are rallying to  Norwood . Reed has been the consummate neoliberal mayor  close to contractors and developers  and hostile to the cityâs activist movement on issues like affordable housing â while avoiding much of the progressive policies other big-city mayors are using to tackle income disparities. The New York Timesâs Thomas Friedman once held the Reed administration up as a model for its willingness to cut back the pensions of its public workers. As The Intercept noted in an article profiling Fortâs bid earlier this year  Atlanta has been ranked as the most unequal city in the country.
 Mary Norwood   candidate for mayor  gives volunteer Jerome Whitaker a hug for  his  support at  her  headquarters Tuesday  Nov. 7  2017  in Atlanta. Photo: Curtis Compton/Atlanta Journal-Constitution /AP
Tim Franzen  a longtime organizer who worked for Fortâs campaign  told The Intercept that while he plans to vote for the conservative Norwood  heâs not endorsing  her  or  her  politics. But he explained the dynamics that are leading many progressives to consider a  Norwood  vote.
âThereâs these narratives going around â one is that [this] is a Trump-Clinton situation. Itâs 100 percent not what we have here in Atlanta.  Mary Norwood  is a constituent-services politician.  She  always has been.  She âs not an ideological person â he explained.
Reedâs administration has also been the center of ethics scandals over the past few years over pay-to-play arrangements; his endorsement of and fundraising for Lance-Bottoms makes many question  her  own commitment to reform on the issue.
Some progressive Atlantans view Lance-Bottoms as a sort of third term for Reed and his ideas â a perception that is boosted by the generous financial backing airport contractors close to his administration have thrown her way. One Atlanta progressive news website that tracks votes on the city council ranks Lance-Bottoms as less progressive than  Norwood ; on issues like housing and homelessness  she has been a steady ally of Reed.
On the popular state political website GeorgiaPol.com  George Chidi â a former Bernie Sanders backer and Occupy Atlanta supporter â penned the post â A Black Voterâs Case for Mary Norwood .â  He  took the Democratic Party to task for taking the black vote in Atlanta for granted. âThe party fails to understand what Atlanta means to black people here  and everywhere in America  frankly â  he  wrote. âWe have a city that has the Gini coefficient of Caracas  nearly the widest gap in racial income in the country  and the lowest income mobility in America. In a recent symposium on racialized homelessness in Atlanta  a speaker noted that the average income of a black household in the city of Atlanta is under $30 000 a year. The average for a white household is over $80 000.â
In an interview with The Intercept  Chidi said he hopes  Norwood  would focus on corruption if she wins. âI hope she wonât be corrupt. I hope sheâll find those who are and see them punished â he said. âBy doing so  I hope sheâll maintain the cityâs international posture as a place to do business.â
And ultimately  the arguments that  Norwood  is a secret Republican fall flat in the face of her support base. Yes  she has courted Republicans as part of her campaign  but sheâs also courted Democrats and progressive independents â her list of endorsers proves that  as does the poll cited above that shows over 42 percent of Democrats in the city are backing her bid. Her stances on social issues in particular â supporting abortion rights and marriage equality â place her far out of step with Georgiaâs traditionally socially conservative Republican Party.
Franklin  the former mayor  alluded to Reedâs ethical issues and explained her rationale for endorsing a white candidate. âFor me  race was not the first issue â she said in her speech endorsing  Norwood . âCharacter  transparency  and integrity are the first issues for me.â (Norwood has come out for campaign donation limits on city vendors.)
Franzen shared Jonesâs torn feelings about  Norwood   whose politics are significantly more conservative than his. But in the end  he couldnât bring himself to vote for a continuation of the Reed regime.
âEveryday Atlantans are feeling the squeeze like they havenât felt in decades. So Iâm not passionate about  Mary Norwood   but I and other people who work on municipal issues have no other choice but to work against Keisha â Franzen reluctantly concluded.

input: For now the building will be known by its address  875 North Michigan Avenue  as the owner seeks a new naming-rights deal  said  Stephen Hearn   president and CEO of Hearn Co.
 Chicago-based Hearn  is part of a group of real estate investors that has owned the office and parking portions of the building since 2013.
âAs they did in Boston  they just decided to have their name removed â  Hearn  said. âAt this point  weâll push harder for a replacement name. This property deserves a more important identity than simply the address.â
John Hancock hasnât paid for the right to have its name on the modernist skyscraper since the last naming-rights contract expired shortly after the current owners bought it   Hearn  said.
The loss of the iconic name comes as  Hearn  decided to continue owning the property after exploring a potential sale.  Hearn  has decided to hold on to the property for at least another two or three years  meaning it will likely be the owner that signs a naming-rights deal.
 Hearn  and its investment partners  Mount Kellett Capital Management and San Antonio-based Lynd Co.  bought their portion of the tower for $140 million in 2013. Mount Kellett is now an affiliate of New York-based Fortress Investment Group.
 Hearn  said several factors  including uncertainty over future interest rates and the impact of new tax laws  slowed the potential sale of its building as well as other large office deals in Chicago.
âIt all led to the notion that this isnât the right time for a sale â  Hearn  said.
The owners instead will look to refinance the property with a new loan   he  said.
 Hearn  will continue talks for naming rights  which  he  said could be tied into a redevelopment of the ground-floor plaza. The plaza  parking garage and naming rights are controlled by the office owner.
 Hearn  previously estimated naming rights could be worth $1.5 million or more annually.
Yet  he  said  he  realizes name changes should not be taken lightly  conscious that many Chicagoans refuse to refer to the former Sears Tower by its nearly decade-old moniker  Willis Tower.
 Hearn  declined to say whether  he  expected the buildingâs new namesake to be a tenant in the building.
âWe have turned away a number of interested parties because we didnât feel the name was appropriate for this iconic property â  Hearn  said. âI want to put an identity on this property that everyone in Chicago can be proud of.â

input: Police have identified  Sayfullo Saipov  as the suspect accused of driving a rented pickup truck into a crowd  killing at least eight people and injuring at least 11 more near the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan.
 Saipov  had worked as an Uber driver in New Jersey  where  he  was living as recently as this summer. Uber confirmed to Fox News that  Saipov  passed the company's background check for drivers  but was now banned from the company. Uber added it has not found any safety reports concerning the terror suspect.
After exiting the vehicle   Saipov  yelled âAllahu akbarâ (""God is great"") and waived around weapons believed to be a paintball gun and a BB gun  police said. The suspect was shot twice by police and taken into custody. He remains in the hospital and is expected to survive his wounds.
It's been reported that  Saipov  rented the truck from a Home Depot store in Passaic  N.J.  around 2 p.m. on Tuesday -- an hour or so before the attack occurred.
Authorities discovered that  Saipov  had a Florida driver's license and has been connected to an address in the Tampa area.
A friend  Kobiljon Matkarov  said he met  Saipov  while the two were living in Florida. He described  Saipov  as being âvery friendlyâ and âvery nice.â
Matkarov said he last saw  Saipov  a few months ago when the suspect picked him up from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City.  Saipov  had moved to the area in order to seek better work opportunities.
Matkarov told Fox News that he never noticed any unusual behavior from the suspect  let alone that heâd been radicalized. He said that  Saipov  was generally a happy-go-lucky person who seemed to love America.
In a statement to Fox News  Uber said the company was in contact with the FBI and has offered its assistance to the investigation into  Saipov . It added that Uber was reviewing  Saipov 's history with the ride-hailing company.

""In five years  if you go to a Starbucks or McDonald's and try to buy a burger or coffee with fiat currency  the person at the counter is going to laugh at you ""  Draper  told an audience Friday in San Francisco. ""There's a real need for a currency that's global.""
 Draper 's presentation at the Blockchain Connect Conference came by video and helped kick off a full day of panels and presentations from developers and investors. The event was so crowded that people were filling up the overflow room to listen on televisions  and  Draper 's video aired late because of technical difficulties.
 Draper   who backed companies including Skype and Baidu in the earlier days of the internet  has made a personal fortune on bitcoin and has more recently turned his attention to initial coin offerings. He said in May that he was participating in the Tezos ICO  one of the biggest crypto offerings of the past year. That deal has been plagued by conflict  with the founders stuck in a financial battle with one of the leaders of the project.
 Draper  said there will be ""fits and starts"" in the emergence of blockchain but over time it will effect ""industry after industry.""

 Chang had performed a number of biopsies on breast cancer patients  both on those whose cancers were confined to the breast and on those whose cancers had metastasized to the brain.
 From those biopsies  Chang said she had identified a number of genetic pathways ways in which gene mutations affected the ability of the cancer to spread unique to patients who developed metastatic breast cancer.
 ""But I had a lot of trouble with the data and trying to translate it into clinical practice "" she said. She couldn't find her way out from beneath the avalanche of data.
 So she turned to Wong.
 Using his mathematical modeling  Wong sifted through Chang's data and the large databases of genome and clinical trial data. Out of that  he identified several candidate drugs to impair the genetic pathways that helped the cancer spread.
Chang's data and the large databases of genome and clinical trial data. Out of that  he identified several candidate drugs to impair the genetic pathways that helped the cancer spread.
 One of them  a drug named sunitinib  which treats a kidney cancer called renal cell carcinoma  emerged as the best bet. Chang then tested the drug in mice  and the study showed it prevented breast cancer from spreading to the brain.
 She has already begun a Phase II clinical trial of the drug  enrolling nine patients with metastatic breast cancer  and she is looking for more.
 ""The drug is very well-tolerated by patients  and so far the trial is going very well "" Chang said.
 But by using an existing drug  Chang and Wong could skip the lengthy Phase I  during which a drug is checked for safety. If Chang's tests go well  sunitinib could be on the market within a few years for metastatic breast cancer.

Now complete the following example-
input: Is  it  just me  or is anybody else worried about  Duncan Keith ?
Maybe  it ’s just the recency bias of a bad three-game trip to California in which the Blackhawks defense was exposed as if each unit has to take a turn looking awful in this season that refuses to end. Or maybe  Keith  is the last of the core players to succumb this season to the fall of the dynasty. Or maybe it’s long-lasting and irretrievable.
The last possibility is the scary one because  Keith  has always been the barometer of good Hawks and bad Hawks. The Hawks’ offense has always started with the defense  and the defense starts with  Keith   and unfortunately of late  the defense has been inept and inert  not to mention soft and slow.
In Sunday’s loss in Anaheim   Keith  aided and abetted a power-play goal by Ducks forward Rickard Rakell by doing little to prevent it. In the previous game   Keith  committed two awful giveaways that led to Kings goals. In the first game of the jaunt in  San Jose  Keith  was on the ice for four goals against while skating five-on-five. Today’s edition of Sesame Street hockey is brought to you by the letters P and U.
Only six times in the last 14 games when skating five-on-five has  Keith  been above 50 percent in the Fenwick metric that counts only unblocked shots  according to NaturalStatTrick.com.
The raw numbers in those games show  he  has been on the ice for three goals for and 19 against at even-strength for a minus-16. Now  plus-minus in isolation is an outdated way to evaluate players  but something that extreme is hard for me to ignore. It might not always be  his  fault  but  he ’s not doing enough to make it better.
By comparison   Keith ’s five-on-five Fenwick metric was over 50 percent 10 times in the 20 games before the last four weeks.  His  raw numbers were 17 goals for and 12 against.
Overall   his  goals-for percentage of 39.78 at five-on-five is the worst of the 10 defensemen the Hawks have dressed this season  according to NaturalStatTrick.com. The raw count is 37 goals for and 56 against.
Last season   Keith ’s goal-for percentage at five-on-five was 56.48. The raw count was 61-47. So  yeah   Keith  misses Niklas Hjalmarsson. A lot. The whole team does.
 Keith   then  has had to adapt to different partners while continuing to play a lot and play against the opponent’s top line. All of those are legit causes for  Keith ’s unseemly numbers. But still  it’s a problem when a team’s best defenseman isn’t delivering  especially on a team that relies on defensemen to start the offense.
The eye test – my eye test  anyway – sees a guy whose reactions can’t quite keep up with his instincts.  Keith  has played several lifetimes of hockey the past decade – a lot of regular-season minutes  then even more minutes in an astounding 126 playoff games  and  oh  two Olympics – so it would reasonable to expect that at 34 even the indefatigable one would lose a half-step. That half-step can keep a player from getting to a spot first  from breaking up plays  from getting a stick on an opponent  from taking away a puck and moving it up ice.
 Keith ’s remarkable ability seemed to make  him  a one-man neutral-zone trap.  Keith  regularly broke up plays and controlled the puck to create a lot of offense — a lot of quick offense. The Hawks were playing on a lot of short fields.
Thing is  the Hawks still control the puck at even-strength more than you’d think a bad team would  but the forwards aren’t turning that into goals. That would help  Keith ’s numbers look respectable  and maybe that changes next season. Maybe the scorers start scoring next season. Maybe another long offseason will help. Same goes for improved ability and consistency from the rest of the Hawks’ young defense corps.
This isn’t to bury  Keith .  He  can still play  even if not at  his  former Norris Trophy level. So  perhaps the biggest thing that would help the Hawks regain their contending ways is if GM Stan Bowman could bring in a defenseman who makes  Keith  only the second-best on the roster.

input: The fourth quarter has historically not been a particularly busy period for missile tests for the North  according to  Harry Kazianis  director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest  a Washington think tank founded by former President Richard Nixon .
""When we look at the data on the fourth quarter of most years they either test anywhere between zero and two ""  he  said. ""Last year they did two tests.""
Kazianis said there are a lot of contributing factors for why the hermit regime doesn't do as many tests in the final quarter of the year. They include having the military assist in the fall harvest due to North Korea's chronic food shortages. Also   he  said December is when the North tends to conduct more military drills.
""North Korea is just occupied doing other things  but they also have to continue proving their missile technology ""  he  said. ""So I'm not shocked that they did this test but I'm a little surprised since I thought they would hold off until the Olympics.""
Indeed   Kazianis  said there's every expectation that the first quarter will produce ""a heavy testing cycle"" as has been the case with Pyongyang's ballistic missile program.  He  said the North ""has a ton of new technology "" including long-range ballistic missiles and ""new types of heat-shield technology.""
According to  Kazianis   the North has ""a lot of goodies that they will start rolling out. This situation is going to get worse. The testing is going to get more rigorous. We're really at just the tip of the iceberg of seeing their capabilities  to be honest.""

input: Adrienne Gaither ’ s “ Tribulations  ” acrylic on canvas . On view through Feb . 24 in “ How I Got Over ” at Transformer . ( Adrienne Gaither / Transformer ) Adrienne Gaither ’ s abstract color paintings are meticulously constructed   their bright hues divided by straight   hard - edge lines . Yet there ’ s a sense of disorder and even menace in some of them   which is reflected in the title of the D . C . artist ’ s Transformer show : “ How I Got Over .” The tension between neat patterns and haphazard disruptions reveals “ Gaither ’ s personal recovery from traumatic events in her life  ” a gallery note explains . The upsets aren ’ t specified directly   and the titles of the six large canvasses offer few clues . The picture that aims the sharpest point of a neon - orange triangle toward the bottom left of a field of shards is named “ Not Just Knee Deep  ” probably after the Funkadelic song . Other titles are more commonplace   although one small collage is dubbed “ Tribulation .” That color - field painting could be narrative   or at least psychological   would once have been heretical . In the 1960s   theorists of the genre insisted that the only proper concerns of such “ post - painterly ” art were its own forms and materials . Gaither has flouted such dogma previously with color - block grids of hues derived from skin tones . In this show ’ s “ Kill Shots  ” she flirts with representation by jagging a yellow spike across the canvas   suggesting lightning or some other sudden   violent blast . Despite such dynamic gestures   Gaither ’ s work shares much with mid - 20th - century color painting . The artist has a knack for composition and keeps things interesting by juxtaposing both contrary and complementary hues . Yellows and maroons energize one picture   but so do its abutting areas of two slightly different shades of deep blue . These pictures may have been born out of upheaval   but they ’ re immaculately controlled . Adrienne Gaither : How I Got Over Through Feb . 24 at Transformer   1404 P St .

( Sally Canzoneri / Art League Gallery )   Sally Canzoneri  How can you be in two eras at once ?  Sally Canzoneri  simulates time travel with lenticular photographs — matched images of the same place   made years apart and cut into an accordion - fold pattern . From the front   strips of both scenes are visible ; from the sides   only one can be seen . That ’ s why  the artist  calls  her  Art League Gallery show “ Double Takes .”  Canzoneri  lives in Washington   and most of  her  two - timing pictures show D . C . sites   decades or more apart . Here   she has included two Alexandria doublings   including one that contrasts the show ’ s venue   the Torpedo Factory   in 1921 and 2017 . The largest gap   chronologically if not thematically   is between the former slave traders ’ building at 1315 Duke St . in 1861 and 2017 . The older of those pictures is by Mathew Brady   the D . C . Civil War photographer . Most often   though   the earlier image ’ s maker cannot be identified .  Canzoneri  works with unknown predecessors   first by framing  her  shot of the scene in imitation of the original   and then by fusing the two . Think of this not as appropriation   but collaboration . Canzoneri ’ s lenticulars are made of paper rather than marble   but they ’ re a kind of civic art .

Anika Cartterfield ’ s show “ The Wild  ” at VisArts . ( Anika Cartterfield / VisArts ) Anika Cartterfield & Alex Braden At the National Gallery of Art currently stand a grove of columns   sleek and pure   by the late D . C . artist Anne Truitt . Anika Cartterfield also makes columns   but they ’ re not so pristine . The most vivid piece in “ The Wild  ” her show at VisArts Common Ground Gallery   slams a tree ’ s root ball through a hollow pillar . The ragged end that erupts from one side is painted white to match the surface it breaches ; the other end is smoother and varnished like a piece of furniture . Cartterfield   who lives in Upstate New York   formerly worked for Vermont ’ s forest service . When working with wood   she ’ s concerned more with the quality of the raw material than with what it might be made into . She subverts the look of white - walled art spaces and neatly sanded sculptures with pieces that are unfinished and partly open to reveal their structure . This show ’ s tidiest pieces are three columns topped with photos of art installations in forests . The woods   it appears   are Cartterfield ’ s favorite gallery . Alex Braden ’ s sound installation “ A Lesser Light .” ( Alex Braden / VisArts ) Downstairs at VisArts   Gibbs Street Gallery has become a listening room for Alex Braden ’ s electronic music . The D . C . composer ’ s “ A Lesser Light ” is an “ automated improvisation ” that randomly emits bits of music in a theoretically infinite arrangement . The sounds include drones   whooshes and clipped notes ; they recall Balinese gamelan and the music of Steve Reich and Brian Eno . In previous installations   Braden has employed near - obsolete and sometimes unreliable technology   including rotary telephones and cassette players . But this piece ’ s physical presence consists only of the speakers that broadcast the eight different audio channels . The result is a room and a composition that are clean and clear   with just enough capriciousness to keep listeners looking over their shoulders .

Antonio McAfee & Rachel Guardiola In the epilogue to “ Invisible Man  ” author Ralph Ellison refers to aspects of African American history as “ Old Bad Air .” Antonio McAfee borrows that phrase for the title of his Hamiltonian Gallery show of manipulated vintage photos . The Baltimore artist distorts 19th - century portraits of people of color to suggest how their subjects ’ lives were warped by racism and oppression . Included are several large photos that display various degrees of digital abuse ; one nearly abstract image appears in both negative and positive versions . There ’ s also a full wall of small   deformed pictures   printed on thin acrylic so they curl partly off the wall . This multitude   dignified yet precarious   is the most powerful chapter in McAfee ’ s history lesson . Also at Hamiltonian is Rachel Guardiola ’ s “ A Hand Without Horizon Is Taller Than Its Other  ” which includes altered video as well as photos . Mostly derived from the artist ’ s performances   the images illustrate the actions of a fictional “ time - traveling surveyor and a horticultural pirate ” as they travel “ an earth - like planet  ” according to the gallery . In the photos   hot colors and overlapping   close - up images seem to turn Guardiola ’ s hands into a sort of flora . In this miniature universe   the artist is both the explorer and the explored .

input: Republicans I spoke with last week are bracing for the latter path and another knock-down  drag-out fight. Obama should surprise them with another direction entirely: declare Bush tax cuts  like the Bush administration itself  over.
 Rarely has a new conversation been so needed. Isn't it time we stopped fighting over Bush's tax policy? Wouldn't it be refreshing to have a fiscal-policy debate without repeating Bush's name?
 In the long history of tax policy  there have been few issues more divisive than the Bush cuts. Since they passed  Democratic presidential candidates have called for their repeal  Republican candidates for their extension -- even John McCain  the 2008 nominee  who had voted against them in 2001 and 2003. The Bush tax cuts are the black hole that swallowed the fiscal- policy debate.
 The fact is  if we extend the Bush tax cuts  it locks in the status quo. Earth to Washington: The status quo stinks. With the economy still limping forward  much more significant fiscal- policy medicine is in order.

Now complete the following example-
input: Aaron Judge  always seems to make it happen â no matter what.
Even when  he âs not hitting   he  still manages to make a game-saving catch â just like  he  did in Game 3  when  he  robbed Francisco Lindor of a two-run homer.
And even when  he âs striking out in nearly every at-bat   he  still manages to come up with the biggest hit of the night â just like  he  did in Game 4  when  he  battled back against Trevor Bauer and ultimately produced a two-out  two-run double in the second inning that gave the Yankees a 4-0 lead en route to a 7-3 victory over the Indians in the Bronx  which sets up a do-or-die Game 5 on Wednesday night at Progressive Field.
 Judge  entered that at-bat 0-for-11 with nine strikeouts in the ALDS. But  he  certainly made  his  first hit of the series count â producing two huge runs.
â He  continues to be patient â Joe Girardi said. âTheyâre making a lot of good pitches on  him   thereâs no doubt about that. But heâs maintaining the strike zone when he gets a pitch to hit â and a lot of times  heâs able to hit it. He was able to do it (Monday night). Thatâs a huge hit. Thereâs a big difference between 2-0 and 4-0. It allowed Luis Severino to relax a bit.â
Girardi had said going into Game 4 that  Judge  was due. And given that  Judge  had a couple of bad strike three calls go against him earlier in the series â the manager had a point.
 Aaron Judge  delivered the biggest hit of the night. (Al Bello/Getty Images)
Yet  Judge  was facing a starter in Bauer that had  his  number.
Bauer had fanned  Judge  three times in his Game 1 gem  another time in Judgeâs first at-bat of Game 4 â getting him to chase a high fastball with the count full â and after  Judge  fell behind 0-2 in his second at-bat  it was about to be five Ks in a row.
But  Judge  is the potential 2017 AL MVP  after all  no easy out â even when  he âs not going well at the plate.
So  Judge  took two straight curveballs in the dirt from arguably the best curveball pitcher in baseball  evening the count at 2-2.
 He  then fouled off a curve and a 97-mph fastball to stay alive.

 Judge  took a third breaking ball in the dirt to bring about a second consecutive full count. And Bauer threw  him  a second consecutive high heater after that.
But this time   Judge  got on top of the 96-mph fastball  driving it into left field  as Aaron Hicks and Brett Gardner came around to score  sending the sellout crowd at Yankee Stadium into a frenzy  and forcing Bauer out of the game after just 1.2 innings following an intentional walk to Didi Gregorius.
âStay on the heater. Stay on the heater â  Judge  said when asked about  his  approach. âBauerâs a guy that has great stuff  and he wants to go out there and show it. Heâs a dominant pitcher. I wasnât surprised (I got a fastball there).â

Now complete the following example-
input: Days after  Chicago police Officer Dina Markham  was found dead in  her  bathtub  a break-in took place at  her  Northwest Side home while  her  family attended  her  wake  police records obtained by the Chicago Tribune show.
The disclosure of the still-unsolved âcriminal trespassâ to the residence June 2 adds to the mystery surrounding  Markham âs death as well as that of  her  husband  also a veteran Chicago police officer  whose gunshot death in the coupleâs bedroom 20 months earlier was ruled a suicide.
The FBI and county authorities were still investigating the shooting of Sgt.  Donald Markham  in the coupleâs bed when  his  widowâs body was discovered in the bathtub at the residence over the Memorial Day weekend.
The Cook County medical examinerâs office ruled Dina Markham  47  died May 28 of an accidental drowning after consuming a dangerous mix of alcohol and the powerful anti-anxiety drug alprazolam  commonly sold under the brand name Xanax.
Police had been called to the home in the Norwood Park neighborhood about 6 p.m. that evening after two of  Markham âs friends said they discovered her unresponsive in the water-filled bathtub.
According to records made public by the medical examiner   Markham  had texted a friend âHelp. Please ... no kiddingâ a little after 4 a.m. that day.
Five days after  Markham âs death  a police officer discovered a sliding door open at the back of the house in the 5900 block of North Newark Avenue while conducting a âpremise checkâ about 10:30 p.m. June 2  according to the records released through the Freedom of Information Act.
Two neighbors told police they didnât notice any activity at the house while the family attended Dina Markhamâs wake  according to the records.
In May  shortly before Dina Markham's death  at least two officers involved in the probe were interviewed at the state's attorney's offices about their roles in the investigation into Donald Markhamâs death  the Tribune has reported.
Records show that  Dina Markham told police her husband  51   had locked her out of  their  home the night of  his  death in September 2015 after the couple had been out drinking and argued after leaving a bar about 1 a.m.
In the 911 recordings released by the medical examinerâs office  a distraught Dina Markham told an emergency dispatcher that her husband was unresponsive and bleeding from his head. She pleaded that an ambulance come to the home.
Crime lab tests also showed Donald Markham had gunshot residue on his hand  indicating he'd either fired a gun or was close to a weapon being discharged at the time of his death  according to police records. The records do not indicate whether Dina Markham's hands were ever tested.
Jim Bastian   an attorney and close friend of Dina Markham's family   previously told the Tribune that Markham had ""heard rumors"" of an investigation but had not been contacted for an interview by any law enforcement agency before her death.
One of two friends who discovered her body told police that Dina Markham had called her twice at 3:59 a.m.  but  the friend  didn't answer the phone because  she  was sleeping  the reports show. Six minutes after the calls  Markham sent  the same friend  the text asking for help.

Schmidt will have regular and direct access to the president for cyber security issues  the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the selection process.
 At the same time  cyber experts and potential job candidates have complained that the position lacks the budgetary and policy-making authority needed to be successful. Schmidt will report to the National Security Council and closely support the National Economic Council on cyber issues.
 Schmidt's selection suggests that economic and business interests in the White House held more sway in the selection process. Schmidt  president and CEO of the Information Security Forum  a nonprofit international consortium that conducts research in information security  has served as chief security officer for Microsoft and as cyber security chief for online auction giant eBay. He was reportedly preferred by Lawrence Summers  director of the economic council. A good format for the titel can be the simple subject + object + verb.

input: Tufts University has postponed an event featuring short-lived White House spokesman and colorful conversationalist Anthony Scaramucci after the Mooch threatened to sue his alma mater's paper over a negative article about him  the Boston Globe reports.
The article was written by 26-year-old Tufts grad student Camilo Caballero  who argued that  Scaramucci  should be removed from  his  spot on Tufts' Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy advisory board  which  Scaramucci  has held since 2016.
 Scaramucci  responded this weekend with a letter from  his  lawyer  demanding that Caballero and the Daily issue a retraction and an apology immediately.
""Neither Mr. Caballero nor the Tufts Daily can credibly hide behind shield of opinion  because the Article plainly presents as fact alleged  Scaramucci  conduct as unethical and dishonest "" the letter reads. ""The Article's allegations are not presented as opinion but rather as false facts.""
If the Daily doesn't apologize and retract the statements   Scaramucci  ""will be forced to take further legal action "" the letter concluded.
Instead of saying a tearful sorry  Daily published the cease-and-desist letter online and in print  and Tufts subsequently postponed  Scaramucci 's scheduled speech at the university on Monday until the ""legal action"" is resolved  Tufts spokesman Patrick Collins told the Globe.
""We're disappointed that  Mr. Scaramucci  has taken this action "" Collins said.
It's unclear whether Tufts will ultimately remove  Scaramucci  from  his  position on the advisory board  but if  he  is  at least it would give  him  more time to work on  his  own journalistic aspirations.

input: Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon  broke some bad news to House investigators on Tuesday  announcing that the White House has invoked executive privilege to keep  him  from answering many of their questions.
But executive privilegeâthe presidentâs right to keep certain information from the public so  he  can have frank conversations with aidesâwill not keep  Steve Bannon  from sharing information with Special Counsel Robert Muellerâs team  according to a person familiar with the situation.
âMueller will hear everything  Bannon  has to say â said the source  who is familiar with  Bannon âs thinking.
During a closed-door hearing before the House intelligence committee today   Bannon  reportedly told lawmakers that President Donald Trump has invoked broad executive privilege for the purposes of Congressional inquiries. Because of that   Bannon  refused to answer committee membersâ questions about what happened during the presidential transition and in the White House.
This sweeping understanding of privilege will not impact what  Bannon  tells Muellerâs team  according to our source. (To be sure   Bannon  isn't known for being predictable  and it's possible  his  team may still look for ways to dodge Mueller's queries.)
But it means  he  isnât answering many of Congressâs questions. A source familiar with Bannonâs interview told The Daily Beast that despite the subpoenaâissued by Devin Nunes  the typically Trump-friendly chairman of the committee âBannon  refused to answer questions about events that happened after Election Day.

Now complete the following example-
input: They aren’t the only ones. An unknown person made a cross out of plywood  painted it blue and added letters that read “RIP Randy.” The memorial was left on a bench in downtown Libertyville.  Foss  was known for quietly sitting on benches outside the former Caribou Coffee and the Methodist church.
“Most of the time  he  wasn’t one to talk   he  just liked being around people ” Mason said. “When the restaurants closed  people would bring  him  leftovers. Commuters from the train would say hello to  him .”
“There’s nobody else to pay anything  and I knew  Randy   I took care of  his  parents.  He ’d stop by and visit me from time to time ” Dane said. “Anyone from Libertyville who has a problem and passes away  I’m not going to let them sit in a morgue.”
Struggling to make ends meet in job after job  Mason said  Foss  felt abused by landlords.
 He  eventually moved back into  his  mother’s house until she sold it in the early 2000s and moved into an assisted living facility that prohibited overnight guests  Mason said. His mother died in 2004  according to her death notice.
“When she died  that’s when he was truly  truly homeless ” Mason said  noting that in her video  Foss  talked about keeping valuable possessions in his mother’s apartment and occasionally sneaking in to sleep on the couch.
 Foss  was arrested numerous times over the years for offenses like public intoxication  public urination  and failing to appear in court  according to news reports.
At one point in  his  homelessness  a butcher in downtown Libertyville let  Foss  use the store’s address for legal documents and for job applications  according to Mason. The store is now out of business.
For a while   Foss  would rake portions of a Libertyville cemetery and clean a memorial for veterans  but Mason said that ended when visitors complained about a homeless man using the water spigot to clean his clothes.

Mason’s brother Tim worked for the Methodist church and for a while would pay  Foss  to do janitorial services and allowed  him  to use the facility to clean up   she  said.
“During that time   he  seemed so much better ” Mason said. “ He  had a purpose   he  would do work for the church   he  would come to the Sunday services and sit in the back   he  would come when the band was here. Some of that I’m sure got  him  out of the elements  but  he  was participating even when it was nice out.”
However  Mason said her brother took a position at a church in Iowa a few years ago and  Foss  lost that income.
 Foss  was identified and enrolled for “permanent supportive housing ” which is an endless subsidized housing voucher for homeless individuals who have a disability  have been homeless more than a year and rank as “high vulnerability” on a chart that factors risks for mortality.

At about the same time as Pence took to Twitter  a White House official was explaining to reporters traveling with the vice president to South Korea that  Pence 's team did contact the U.S. Olympic Committee. But the vice president's office was offering— not requesting — a meeting with Rippon and wanted to give the skater as much space as possible. The official declined to be identified.
Columnist Christine Brennan reported on Wednesday that  Pence  had become so concerned about criticism he faced from Rippon  an openly gay athlete  that his staff reached out to the USOC to set up a conversation between the two.
Headed to the Olympics to cheer on #TeamUSA. One reporter trying to distort 18 yr old nonstory to sow seeds of division. We won’t let that happen! #FAKENEWS. Our athletes are the best in the world and we are for ALL of them! #TEAMUSA — Vice President Mike Pence (@VP) February 8  2018
.@Adaripp I want you to know we are FOR YOU. Don’t let fake news distract you. I am proud of you and ALL OF OUR GREAT athletes and my only hope for you and all of #TeamUSA is to bring home the gold. Go get ‘em! — Vice President Mike Pence (@VP) February 8  2018
“ You mean Mike Pence  the same Mike Pence that funded gay conversion therapy ? I’m not buying  it  ” Rippon responded.
Around the same time that  Pence  sent out his two tweets over the reports about his spat with Rippon  a White House official confirmed that the vice president's chief of staff Nick Ayers called U.S. Olympic Committee CEO Scott Blackmun after Rippon had initially criticized  Pence  last month.
Rippon’s criticism of  Pence  was over language on a campaign website that some LGBT activists say shows that as a congressman the vice president had supported gay conversion therapy.
Ayers told Blackmun that the criticism of  Pence  was untrue and that he never supported gay conversion therapy  the White House official told reporters. When the issue surfaced during the 2016 presidential campaign   Pence 's then press secretary  Marc Lotter  also denied that  Pence  supported the policy.
Ayers offered to have someone from the vice president's team explain to Rippon the confusion over  Pence 's stance. Ayers also said that  Pence  would meet with Rippon or speak with him over the phone if he preferred  the White House official said.

input: When  Ava Gardner  first met Frank Sinatra in 1943   the duo  couldn’t have suspected that six years later  after the actress faced two disastrous divorces before the age of 25  they would happily dive into a controversial love affair.
Sinatra may have still been married  but an insistent  Gardner  reportedly made the singer ask Nancy for a divorce. The mother of  his  three young children initially refused  but she eventually granted Sinatra a divorce in 1951. One week after  his  divorce was final  Sinatra married Gardner.
“I don’t think [Frank] wanted to hurt Nancy ” said Uzarowski. “But at the same time  I don’t think  he  went out of  his  way to hide [the affair]. They did get into quite a lot of trouble with the public. There were angry letters  hate mail coming in every week to the studio.
“She really liked  Ava  ” said Uzarowski. “She could have had a very bad attitude towards  Ava  because she basically stole her father away from her mother. She could have been resentful. But there was none of that… Tina and Nancy were both very friendly with  Ava .”
“The first time she met  Ava   when she was a little girl of 4 or 5   Ava  got down on her knees so she [could] have eye contact with her ” said Uzarowski. “And she really treated her with a lot of attention and a lot of warmth. That obviously really impressed her as a child. She still remembered that after all of these years.”
Still   Gardner  and Sinatra wouldn’t share a happily ever after. Their marriage was plagued by jealousy  fiery tempers and insecurity. They also publicly battled. The relationship was reportedly so tumultuous that  Gardner  had two abortions during their marriage  which she later publicly admitted.
According to Tina   Gardner  later wondered what the couple could have done differently.
The marriage lasted for less than two years. In 1953  MGM announced their separation. Then in 1957   Gardner  and Sinatra were divorced. However  they apparently never got over each other. There were even rumors of a possible reconciliation.
 Gardner  would move on and live a quiet life in London for more than 30 years  seeking salvation from the paparazzi.  She  never remarried.
One of Sinatra’s biggest tragedies would come in 1990 when  Gardner  died at age 67 of pneumonia.
“[Tina] said it was such a huge blow to  him  ” said Uzarowski. “ She  said  he  never got over it… It was such a huge shock to  him .  She  was the love of  his  life  by all accounts. When  she  did pass away   he  was devastated.
""Tina said the actual pain  he  experienced was so much more.  He  wouldn’t share that with anyone because it was too personal… There was a story that Nancy said in another book that  he  just locked  himself  in a room for 24 hours… and wouldn’t speak to anyone.”

 He  continued  “I think a lot of Americans look at Civil Rights and race relations in the South in the ’60s and miss New York in the ’80s where you had many  many incidents.”
 He  added  “They get away with it because don’t want to talk about up North kind of problems and Trump symbolizes it. Trump is as much a symbol of Northern bigotry as you have others that were Southern.”

input: In 2006  New Testament scholar David Trobisch abandoned such lofty outlets as Oxford Press and the Journal of Papyrology and Epigraphy for a more mainstream venue: Free Inquiry.
In that feisty secular humanist journal   Trobisch  identified the likely editor of the New Testament as second-century Bishop Polycarp of Smyrna and suggested that Polycarp  not Luke  wrote much of the book of Acts.
 Trobisch  shared the magazineâs cover billing with Christopher Hitchens and the atheist animal rights theorist Peter Singer.
None of this would be unusual â serious New Testament scholars constantly probe its cloudy origins  wherever that leads â if  Trobisch  were not now prominently employed by one of the most famously conservative Christian families in America.
It will showcase biblical artifacts from the 40 000-piece Green collection  one of the largest in private hands. As director of the collection   Trobisch  does not run the museum ( its  director is Cary Summers)  but in addition to enlarging  curating and cataloging the trove  he participates in the crucial conversation about which items will go into the museum  and how.
A former Heidelberg University professor   Trobisch  also acts as roving ambassador to the worlds of high academia and top-rate museums. His presence poses a conundrum to the Greensâ many critics: As believers that the Bible is God-given and inerrant  could the family â and the museum that is their brainchild â be more open to dispassionate scholarship than previously assumed?
A tall  gently spoken 56-year-old whose russet hair is now mostly gray   Trobisch  splits  his  time between Germany  where  his  wife  son and two grandchildren live  and a home in Springfield  Mo. In the U.S. he considers himself part of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America  a mainline denomination that allows gay clergy.
 Trobisch  eventually gravitated to New Testament criticism  the close study of ancient manuscripts for clues as to how the 27-book New Testament came together.
 He  met the Greens when  he  asked permission to look at their 850 ancient New Testament documents. Soon   he  was advising the family on acquisitions (âMy strategy was to buy fewer items but only the highest qualityâ). In February   he  was hired as director.
 Trobisch âs responsibilities extend beyond researching and caring for the collection.  He  recently revamped the content in the Greensâ 1 000- item Bible exhibition âPassages.â  He  also created one-off exhibits in places such as the Vatican  Jerusalem and (very quietly) Cuba. Next up? Philadelphia (in time for Pope Francisâ visit)  Berlin  Beijing and Moscow.
One day in early April   Trobisch  was alighting in New York after a three-week trip involving at least six countries on four continents  having discussed Green extension museums with professionals from Africa and Asia.  He  considered a Bible for sale in Istanbul  hired a curator in Germany and helped open the latest Passages in Santa Clarita  Calif.
The museumâs burgeoning relationship with blue-chip institutions is partly attributable to Trobischâs prestige and contact list. When Cambridge University Library wanted to auction some treasured goods  the Greens bought them â and left them with Cambridge. There was no quid quo pro  but Cambridge owns the Codex Bezae  which  Trobisch  calls âthe fourth most important manuscript of the New Testament.â The strengthened relationship increases the chances the Washington museum might someday show it.
 Trobisch  might have expected some philosophical friction with the Greens  who famously turn to the Bible for everything  including business decisions. But  he  says Hobby Lobby chain president Steve Green is open to new scholarship.
âWe agreed that if I say something about the Bible  he  disagrees with and I can show  him  the quote   he  will concede. If I cannot support it by a quote  I will concede.â
â He âs a Bible freak â  Trobisch  said. âLike me.â
 Trobisch  disagrees with some in âthe media and my scholarly peersâ that  his  employment by the museum represents a faceoff of âfundamentalism against sound scholarship.â Instead   he  said  it constitutes âtwo parties standing at opposite ends of the Christian spectrum talking to each other and working together. This almost never happens in the U.S.â

input: Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez is taking a part-time  Ivy League teaching gig  after saying earlier this year that the chairmanship should be a âfull time job.â
 Perez  made the comment in late 2016 when  he  joined the competition for the DNC post against Ralph Ellison  a full-time Minnesota Democratic congressman  and while  Perez  was still pondering a 2018 run for Maryland governor.
 He  also reportedly said at the time that the party needs to have âsomeone committed here for the long haul.""
Washington Republicans pounced on the announcement Thursday that  Perez  would be a senior fellow at  his  alma mater  Brown University.
âThe DNC canât raise money  their âBetter Dealâ slogan flopped  the Unity Tours were a disaster -- and  Tom Perez  thinks itâs a good time for a side gig?â the Republican National Committee asked.
 Perez   labor secretary under President Obama  will lead a study group called âGovernance and Leadership in Challenging Times.â
Brown declined to comment Saturday on whether  Perez  is being paid for the one-year appointment and how often he must appear on campus. ""Beyond position titles and dates of service  we are not at liberty to disclose deails related to personnel "" a Brown spokesman said.
The announcement also comes a few weeks after the DNC posted its worst July fundraising numbers in a decade  raising questions about why the party machine cannot capitalize on President Trumpâs low approval ratings and whether  Perez  is up to the task.
The DNC raised $3.8 million in July  compared to $10.2 million for the Republican National Committee. The tally fit a pattern for the Democrats  who have posted a string of depressed fundraising numbers month after month this year  even after  Perez  took charge in February.
 Perez   after the small July haul was announced  attributed the disappointing results to understaffing and too few fundraisers as  he  tries to rebuild the group in the wake of 2016's damaging controversies.
Many Democrats seem willing to extend  Perez  a longer honeymoon  considering the situation  he  inherited.
The divide was clearly on display earlier this year during the DNCâs so-called Unity Tour  in which  Perez  and Ellison appeared on stage amid questions about whether the party should back pro-life candidates.

input: In November of last year  three Oberlin students â all minorities â were arrested after trying to shoplift from the bakery's wine selection  and then ""punching and kicking the white shopkeeper ""  Allyn Gibson   according to an Associated Press report. Two of the students claimed that they were ""racially profiled"" by the shop owner  and that they'd simply come in to buy wine  albeit using a fake ID  when  Gibson  accused them of stealing.
But by the time the students admitted that they probably weren't profiled  the damage had already been done in the Oberlin community  according to a legal complaint filed by  Gibson  late last month. Students have staged a number of protests outside the bakery  and the Oberlin student senate passed a resolution claiming  Gibson  has âa history of racial profiling and discriminatory treatment.â
The lack of proof hasn't stopped students from reportedly boycotting the cafe  and   Gibson  claims student advisers and campus tour guides tell prospective students that  Gibson 's is racist.  Gibson  even alleges that the school administration has participated in the protests  and that  after finding out students had stolen from the bakery  pushed the bakery's owners to drop the criminal charges and let Oberlin handle the incident instead of law enforcement.
âI have not taken a paycheck since this happened more than a year ago â  Gibson  said in an email. âSometimes you have to stand up to a large institution. Powerful institutions â including Oberlin College â and their members must follow the same laws as the rest of us.â

 Schmidt's selection comes more than 10 months after Obama declared cyber security a priority and ordered a broad administration review.
 A senior White House official said Obama was personally involved in the selection process and chose Schmidt because of his unique background and skills. Schmidt will have regular and direct access to the president for cyber security issues  the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the selection process.
 At the same time  cyber experts and potential job candidates have complained that the position lacks the budgetary and policy-making authority needed to be successful. Schmidt will report to the National Security Council and closely support the National Economic Council on cyber issues.
 Schmidt's selection suggests that economic and business interests in the White House held more sway in the selection process. Schmidt  president and CEO of the Information Security Forum  a nonprofit international consortium that conducts research in information security  has served as chief security officer for Microsoft and as cyber security chief for online auction giant eBay. He was reportedly preferred by Lawrence Summers  director of the economic council. A good format for the titel can be the simple subject + object + verb.

She  said yes with zero hesitation. â Mike DiCenzo (@mikedicenzo) November 14  2017

input: Joakim Noah  a noted pacifist and critic of Donald Trump  has a two-step plan to get this country back on track: institute tougher gun control and invest in the inner cities.
âI would make it a lot harder to get guns  No. 1 â  Noah  said. âI mean kids have access to guns in this country and we donât even talk about it. Kids are killing each other at alarming rates and itsâ still so easy to buy guns  to buy bullets. We point fingers whenever we can. Itâs just so easy to buy a gun in this country. So I would start with that.
âI would make more of an investment in the communities  in the âhood â  Noah  added. âThere definitely needs to be more of an investment by these politicians. I think thatâs where violence prevention starts  in these community centers. And if you go into these neighborhoods  thereâs not much going on. So I think if we can invest in the kids  I think the violence will go down.â
Although  Noah  said thereâs no plan yet to protest the anthem   he âs appreciative of Colin Kaepernick for finally forcing the conversation.
âI think itâs great because weâre finally talking about whatâs important  â Noah  said. âObviously I have my beliefs. I put in a lot of work in the neighborhoods trying to help at risk youth. I have my opinions. But I respect this country a lot  but we have to look at everything thatâs going on as a positive because weâre finally talking about issues that are usually swept under the rug. Because somebody takes a knee weâre finally talking about whatâs important.â
Last year  Noah  declined to participate in a team activity with cadets at West Point â where the Knicks were holding training camp â because of  his  anti-war views. It wasnât a protest   he  said  just a decision not to feel uncomfortable.  He  is also active with  his  Chicago-based foundation â Noahâs Arc â which works to promote positive change in violence-ravaged city.

input: CBS News has suspended veteran journalist  Charlie Rose  after eight women accused him of sexual misconduct in interviews with The Washington Post. Three additional unnamed women came forward in a story published by Business Insider later on Monday.
Interested in  Charlie Rose ? Add Charlie Rose as an interest to stay up to date on the latest  Charlie Rose  news  video  and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest
"" Charlie Rose  is suspended immediately while we look into this matter. These allegations are extremely disturbing and we take them very seriously "" CBS News said in a statement.
Five women told The Washington Post that  Rose   an anchor for ""CBS This Morning "" groped them; two said that he walked naked in front of them; and one accused  Rose of  firing  her  after he allegedly touched  her  inappropriately and made sexually charged remarks to  her .
The newspaper reported that  Rose 's accusers either worked with or aspired to work with him on his PBS show  "" Charlie Rose  "" from the late 1990s to 2011. At the time of the alleged incidents  the women ranged in age from 21 to 37  according to the newspaper.
 Rose  issued an apology to the Post and later  he shared it on Twitter.
My statement in full. pic.twitter.com/3kvFrqF2dT â Charlie Rose (@charlierose) November 20  2017
Kyle Godfrey-Ryan  a former assistant to  Rose  in the mid-2000s and one of the three accusers who spoke to the Post on the record  claimed that  Rose  walked nude in front of  her  at one of his homes in New York City and called  her  in the wee hours to describe fantasies of watching  her  swim naked.  She  said that  she  reported his calls to  Rose 's longtime executive producer  Yvette Vega  who apparently told  her   ""That's just Charlie being Charlie."" Vega told the Post and later confirmed to ABC News that she regretted not doing more for Godfrey-Ryan and others who mounted similar complaints.
Godfrey-Ryan said that ultimately   Rose  fired her  and she later left journalism.
Reah Bravo  who worked alongside Rose beginning in 2007  claimed to the Post that she was groped -- sometimes forcefully -- by  Rose  on more than one occasion. In 2008  she said that as she prepared to accept a new job   Rose  offered her a position in Washington  D.C.  and the opportunity to live in his Georgetown residence. She declined.
Megan Creydt  the third woman who spoke to the Post on the record  overlapped with Godfrey-Ryan when she worked as a coordinator on  Rose 's show from 2005 to 2006. Creydt claimed that  Rose  put his hand on her thigh  which alarmed her.
In a statement to ABC News  Yvette Vega  executive producer on âCharlie Rose â said: âI should have stood up for them. I failed. It is crushing. I deeply regret not helping them.â
In a story published later Monday evening by Business Insider  three other women  all former âCharlie Roseâ interns  also accused  Rose  of inappropriate behavior  speaking to the site on the condition of anonymity. One  an intern in 2010  said  Rose  touched her legs in a car while his driver took them back to her college dorm. She said months later he invited her to his hotel room to discuss a potential job. She ended up not going and never heard from him again  she said.
""PBS was shocked to learn today of these deeply disturbing allegations "" the network said in a statement. ""'Charlie Rose' is produced by Charlie Rose  Inc.  an independent television production company. PBS does not fund this nightly program or supervise its production  but we expect our producers to provide a workplace where people feel safe and are treated with dignity and respect.""
Bloomberg says it has suspended broadcasts of ""Charlie Rose."" ""We are deeply disturbed to learn of these allegations and are immediately suspending the show from airing on Bloomberg TV "" the company said in a statement.

 He  said the number of news outlets with paywalls had reached a critical mass in the last year  to the point that it made sense for Google to start developing tools for them.
The goal is to facilitate fast purchases that could take as little as a single click   Gingras  said. Customers’ names and emails would be shared with the publishers.
A separate tool would give publishers data on how to maximize sign ups with personalized offers.  Gingras  said Google hasn’t determined whether it may charge a fee to recoup costs of that program.
“Google search is valuable because there’s a rich ecosystem out there ”  Gingras  said. “To the extent the web is healthy  that’s very good for our core business. Our objective is not for this to be a new line of business.”

input: Late night host Jimmy Kimmel  found  himself  to be the punchline of a joke Tuesday after a conservative artist mocked the comedian at the location where  he  crashed  his  vehicle.
 Kimmel  was driving outside the famous Chateau Marmont Hotel when  he  made an illegal left turn  ignoring the traffic sign. The comedian crashed  his  car into a passing Audi. No one was injured in the accident.
The conservative artist decided to make  Kimmel  the butt of the joke and place a sign directly under the other apparently ignored by  Kimmel   according to The Hollywood Reporter.
Sabo told The Hollywood Reporter he targeted  Kimmel  due to comments he made on “Pod Save America.”  Kimmel  told the podcast hosts that “pretty much every late-night talk show (host) is a liberal. And that’s because it requires a measure of intelligence.”
Sabo said  Kimmel  apparently was not using his intellect during the time of the crash.
 Kimmel  has been the target of Sabo’s attacks previously. In October  the artist put pictures of  Kimmel  on bus stop benches calling the host a “cry baby” and dubbed his show “Estrogen Hour.”
 Kimmel  hit back by snapping a photo of  himself  on the bus bench with  his  middle finger up.  He  has not immediately commented on the fake traffic sign.

Schmidt will have regular and direct access to the president for cyber security issues  the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the selection process.
 At the same time  cyber experts and potential job candidates have complained that the position lacks the budgetary and policy-making authority needed to be successful. Schmidt will report to the National Security Council and closely support the National Economic Council on cyber issues.
 Schmidt's selection suggests that economic and business interests in the White House held more sway in the selection process. Schmidt  president and CEO of the Information Security Forum  a nonprofit international consortium that conducts research in information security  has served as chief security officer for Microsoft and as cyber security chief for online auction giant eBay. He was reportedly preferred by Lawrence Summers  director of the economic council. A good format for the titel can be the simple subject + object + verb.

input: A source close to the Vatican said that Mr Bush was the most ""Catholic-minded"" president since John F Kennedy , who famously played down his Catholicism . 
George W Bush and Pope Benedict XVI have held an intimate meeting in Rome as rumours mounted in Italy that the president may follow in Tony Blair 's footsteps and convert to Catholicism . 
However , George William Rutler , a New York-based priest who is close to the president , was quoted by the Washington Post earlier this year saying that Mr Bush ""is not unaware of how evangelism , by comparison with Catholicism , may seem more limited both theologically and historically"" . 
The usual protocol for heads-of-state is a meeting in the pope 's library in the Apostolic Palace , but a spokesman for the Vatican said Benedict wanted to reward Mr Bush for the ""warmth"" of his reception at the White House earlier this year . 
The two men have grown increasingly close in the past two years , and Mr Bush was overheard whispering : ""What an honour , what an honour , what an honour !"" 
Mr Bush appointed the Catholic judges Samuel Alito and John Roberts to the Supreme Court . 
Mr Bush belongs to a Methodist church in Texas and prays at an Episcopal church in Washington . 
However , it is thought unlikely that Mr Bush would convert until after he has left office . 
However , Mr Bush did not , as expected , kneel in prayer before the Grotto of the Madonna of Lourdes . 
Mr Bush has filled the White House with Catholic speech-writers and consultants and is also thought to have asked a Catholic priest to bless the West Wing . 
Mr Bush prayed with Benedict in the Oval Office during the Papal visit to the US in April . 
Several Italian newspapers cited Vatican sources suggesting that Mr Bush may be prepared to convert . 
One source told Il Foglio , an authoritative newspaper , that ""Anything is possible , especially for a born-again Christian such as Bush ."" 
Mr Bush has spoken out against gay marriage , abortion and stem cell research .

input: As usual  for the past several years  the answers likely will come from  Justice Anthony M. Kennedy   the 81-year old Reagan appointee who regularly holds the deciding vote when the rest of the court is evenly split along ideological lines.
All eyes will be on  Kennedy  even more than normal as this yearâs term could be  his  last.  The justice  has turned away questions about  his  plans  but Republicans on Capitol Hill predict  Kennedy  will retire soon  although  of course  they predicted the same thing last year. If  Kennedy  does step down  President Trump could replace  him  with a younger  more reliable conservative and tilt the court decidedly to the right.
For now  however  lawyers in the biggest cases will focus on how to win over  Kennedy . That explains why the gay rights laws in the blue states and the partisan election maps in the red states are both being challenged as threats to the 1st Amendmentâs guarantee of freedom of speech.
 Kennedy  has been the courtâs leader in striking down laws that discriminated against gays and lesbians  but  he  also has been a steady champion of free speech. Religious rights advocates insist that religious freedom is in danger in this country  but in court  they rely mostly on the 1st Amendment principle that the government cannot force someone to speak its message.
Their argument  like the one in the bakerâs case  is aimed at  Kennedy . The last time the high court considered political gerrymandering â and decided not to act  â Kennedy  wrote that the court might be more open to a future appeal based on free-speech principles.
âThe 1st Amendment may be the more relevant constitutional provision in future cases â  he  wrote in that 2004 case  noting that states arguably were âpenalizing citizens because â¦ of their association with a political party or their expression of political views.â

input: Do you fear death? Thatâs the question that  the satanic figure Davy Jones  poses to  his  intended victims throughout At World's End  the third movie in Walt Disneyâs Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy. And  the answer the movie gives is that death is not the worst thing that can happen to you. In fact  the movie suggests that being a slave to the devil  a slave to sin  a man without honor who will betray his friends or serve evil forces  and being condemned to Hell are all worse than physical death.
The movieâs opening finds Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann allied with Captain Barbossa in a quest to free Captain Jack Sparrow from the limbo underworld of  Davy Jones â locker. They confront the cunning Chinese pirate Sao Feng  who has the map that will lead them through icy waters to Jack.
Meanwhile  the evil Lord Beckett has taken over the East India Trading Company. After having retrieved the heart of  Davy Jones  in the second movie  Lord Beckett now controls  Davy Jones  and his ship the Flying Dutchman. Using the Flying Dutchman  Beckett hangs every man  woman  and child who refuses to submit to his absolute control over the high seas.
After perilously retrieving Jack from  Davy Jones â locker  each character must ultimately choose a side in a final  titanic battle with Lord Beckettâs armada  led by  Davy Jones  and  his  ship and crew. Will is torn between saving his father or saving his love  Elizabeth. Jack is torn between honor and saving his own skin. And  Elizabeth no longer knows who she can trust.
Although the movieâs Christian metaphors are clear  the movie also deals with piracy and some pagan allusions to a âheathen god.â The movie also says that the Flying Dutchman was originally intended to ferry people to the afterlife  but that  Davy Jones  has corrupted  his  supernatural office by enslaving men.

Robert Buchel  star of TLCâs My 600-lb Life  died Nov. 15 from a heart attack while filming the series at a hospital in Houston.
His death was announced by TLC after the Wednesday episode.  Buchel  was 41.
 His  fiancÃ©e  Kathryn Lemanski of Manchester  N.J.  addressed viewers in an epilogue following Wednesday's episode.
â He  told me  âI donât think Iâll make it through the night. I love you and I always will 'â Lemanski said. âI lost my best friend and the person I was supposed to spend the rest of my life with.â
In a November Facebook posting after  Buchel  passed away  Lemanski said the two were going to ""get married in Walt Disney World and have our own Disney Fairy Tale Wedding. We were going to start a family. We were going to grow old together.""
""To carry all this weight is physically draining  mentally  emotionally taxing "" said  Buchel  on the episode. ""It's not a pain or life Iâd wish on anyone because I can't do anything. I canât do anything for anyone â especially myself so I am completely dependent on my fiancÃ©e.""
In a statement  TLC said: ""TLC was deeply saddened by the loss of  Robert . We are grateful to  his  family who were gracious enough to let us continue to share  his  brave story with our viewers. Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult time.""
Each episode of My 600-lb Life follows the life of a morbidly obese person as they attempt to lose weight and change their lifestyle under the care of Houston surgeon Younan Nowzaradan. The series debuted in 2012 and  Buchel  is the first person to pass away on the series.
A GoFundMe was launched on Lemanski's behalf to help defray costs accumulated in the care of  Buchel .
""The only consolation I have right now is that we were together and that his last words of peace to me were how he felt about me and how I felt about him "" said Lemanski about  Buchel . ""And when he did pass  he was not alone. I was there holding his hand.""

input: But at the same time  conditions near the coastal United States are the opposite: colder water  which provides less energy to a hurricane  and more wind shear  which tends to rip a storm apart. So although more hurricanes may form in the open ocean  as they approach land they are more likely to weaken. This protective barrier  as Dr. Kossin called it  does not exist in the Caribbean.
Dr. Kossinâs research found that in the most recent quieter period  from the late 1960s to the mid-1990s  hurricanes that did form were up to six times more likely to intensify rapidly near land  with wind speeds increasing more than 15 miles an hour over six hours.
Although it is difficult to single out any one factor in the evolution of a particular hurricane   Dr. Kossin  said that Hurricane Andrew  a Category 5 storm that devastated South Florida in 1992  was an example of a storm that intensified rapidly during the latest quiet period.
 Dr. Kossin  agreed that more research was needed  especially on how global warming might affect this protective buffer zone.
A lessening of the protective barrier during periods of greater activity would mean that even more damaging hurricanes could hit the Eastern United States. âThat would be a very unsettling prospect â  Dr. Kossin  said.

input: Ja Du   a transgender white person from New Orleans  also claims to be transracial and identifies as Filipino.
 Du  was born Adam Wheeler and grew up loving Filipino food and culture -- so much so  Du  now identifies as Filipino  even driving a purple motorized rickshaw  Du  called a Tuk Tuk  an Asian-derived vehicle used for public transit in the Philippines.
âWhenever Iâm around the music  around the food  I feel like Iâm in my own skin â  Du  told WTSP. âIâd watch the history channel sometimes for hours  you know  whenever it came to that and  you know  nothing else intrigued me more but things about Filipino culture.â
The comments make  Du  a member of a small  but growing  community of people who consider themselves transracial -- meaning to be born one race but identify with another.
âI think things that made no sense to most people make sense to us on an individual level in almost every person  like a swelling feeling you feel when you listen to dramatic music â  Du  told the Huffington Post. âItâs all sound and vibration but something in it relates to your soul on such a subconscious level that you connect with it  and [thatâs] how I feel about the Filipino culture.â
Many members of the Filipino-American community  however  are not pleased  with some even expressing outrage at Duâs assertion  saying  Du  is overlooking the hundreds of years of struggle Filipinos have endured.
âJa Du says he feels like himself when heâs around Filipino food and music and that is fabulous  but to then say you are that race is both unrealistic and problematic â she said. âBeing Filipino means enduring racism  discrimination and micro-aggressions all the time.â

âThe biggest challenge is time and the constant juggling with all the work and personal projects on my brain â  Crenshaw  says. âEvery working mom struggles with this as you never feel like youâre doing the best job at anything  so itâs all about surrounding yourself with the best team possible.â
 Crenshaw  has surrounded  herself  with a group of women who help  her : Abi Getto  the day-to-day manager for VonStroke and his  Barclay Crenshaw  alias; Esther Yoonâthe clothing manager for Dirtybirdâand Lauren Lipsay  the content and marketing manager for Dirtybird.
Getto adds that while there has been a push for more women to perform at festivals  it turns into an issue of commodifying women first and viewing them as talent second.  Crenshaw  says that the industry is guilty of producing âoverly sexual content that objectifies women â but Dirtybird strives to point out and omit that content.
The Dirtybird Campout festivals are an âadult summer campâ experience that combines electronic music with camping and activities   Crenshaw  says.  She  adds that the East Coast location will feature Florida-specific activities  such as an alligator race  a psychic show and alligator wrestling. Getto notes that locally-sourced BBQ will also be available  and VonStroke chose Florida as the location because he wanted fans on the East Coast to experience the festival.
In addition to expanding the festival   Crenshaw  says the brand doubled Birdfeed subscribers and clothing sales in 2017.
Crenshaw and Getto both agree artist interaction has been key in helping Dirtybird successfully grow.  Crenshaw  says itâs important artists under the label treat fans as friends.

input: WASHINGTON (AP) â Suggesting heâs a victim of revenge porn from a jilted lover   Republican Rep. Joe Barton of Texas  says  he  plans to go silent about the release of a nude photo of  him  online because police are investigating the disclosure as a possible crime against  him . Authorities have not confirmed an investigation.
 The 68-year-old Barton  who joined the House in 1985   has acknowledged sharing intimate material with a lover and accused her of threatening to make it public when  he  ended the relationship. The unidentified woman told The Washington Post that she did not put it online and said  the congressman  sought to intimidate her by threatening to go to the authorities if she exposed  his  conduct.
The he said-she said dispute erupted in the midst of sexual misconduct allegations drawing in several other members of Congress as well as Senate Republican candidate Roy Moore of Alabama  who is accused of disrobing a 14-year-old girl. The consequences for  Barton  are not immediately apparent aside from  his  mortification: The relationship with the woman was evidently consensual.
The Post published details of a secretly recorded conversation between  Barton  and  his  lover from 2015 in which  he  threatened to âtake all this crap to the Capitol Hill Police and have them launch an investigationâ if she did not agree to keep âinappropriate photographs and videoâ that  he  had exchanged with her from becoming public.  He  said she had already shared material with other women with whom  he  had been involved.
In a statement after that report   Barton  said the âCapitol Police reached out to  me  and offered to launch an investigation and I have accepted. Because of the pending investigation  we will have no further comment.â  He  said the womenâs comments on the tape could be evidence of a âpotential crime against  me .â
Capitol Police have not said whether they have begun an investigation. A message left by The Associated Press at  Barton âs district office in Arlington  Texas  was not returned. The voicemail for his office in Washington was full.
In a portion of the recorded conversation  the woman asked  Barton  what  he  would tell police if  he  went to them.
 His  reply: âI would tell them that I had a three-year undercover relationship with you over the Internet that was heavily sexual and that I had met you twice while married and had sex with you on two different occasions and that I exchanged inappropriate photographs and videos with you that I wouldnât like to be seen made public  that you still apparently had all of those and were in position to use them in a way that would negatively affect my career. Thatâs the truth.â
 Barton  is the longest-serving congressman in Texas and  his  seat has always been considered reliably safe for Republicans.
The photo of  Barton  appeared on an anonymous Twitter account. It was not immediately known who posted the photo or when it was taken.
 Barton  issued an initial statement saying that while separated from  his  second wife  prior to their divorce in 2015   he  had sexual relationships âwith other mature adult women.â  Barton  said each relationship was consensual and has since ended.
âI am sorry I did not use better judgment during those days. I am sorry that I let my constituents down â  Barton  said.
 Barton  a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus   announced  his  re-election bid this month.  His  district includes several counties in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
 Barton  was a consultant in the oil and gas industry before  he  was elected to Congress.
 He  is currently the vice chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee.  He  was the committeeâs chairman from 2004 to 2007.
 Barton  has also been the longtime manager of the GOP congressional baseball team.  He  was taking part in a team practice in June when a gunman opened fire  injuring another congressman and others.

A British doctor who arrived in Australia two months ago to work   Fry  said Tuesday  he  had recently watched a YouTube video in which Australian professional surfer Mick Fanning described  his  famous escape from a great white shark during a surfing competition in 2015.
“So when it happened  I was like: ‘Just do what Mick did. Just punch it in the nose '”  Fry  told Nine Network television. “So Mick  if you’re watching or listening  I owe you a beer. Thank you very much.”
Fry  25 and a surfing beginner  was in the water with three doctor friends when  he  was attacked off Avoca Beach  90 kilometers (60 miles) north of Sydney
“I was out surfing and I got this massive thud on my right-hand side; it completely blindsided me ”  Fry  said.
“I thought it was a friend goofing around. I turned and I saw this shark come out of the water and breach its head ”  he  said.
“So I just punched it in the face with my left hand and then managed to scramble back on my board  shout at me friends and luckily a wave came  so I just sort of surfed the wave in ”  he  added.
 Fry  said  he  wasn’t conscious of  his  injured and bleeding arm until  he  reached the shore.
“I didn’t really notice it at the time because when you’re surfing  all I’m thinking was: ‘I’m about to die. I’m literally about to die '”  Fry  said.
 Fry’s  friends drove him to Gosford Hospital  where they all worked  to be treated. The beach was closed for 24 hours.
Lifeguards spotted the 3-meter (10-foot) shark that attacked  Fry  close to shore and would use drones on Tuesday to check that it had left the area  Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported.
 Fry  said  he  could not return to the ocean for a week due to  his  injuries  but “after then  I’ll be racing to get back in.”

input: Rose McGowan  called out fellow actress Meryl Streep on social media Friday after the latter described the dozens of sexual misconduct allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein as an âexample of disrespectâ during a womenâs conference in Boston this week.
In her comments   Streep  described the allegations as âthe most gargantuan example of disrespectâ across the many industries dealing with sex misconduct claims.
âItâs such an interesting moment  because this conversation about why this is so widespread  this is really worth having and itâs fantastic â  she  said. âI canât help thinking itâs just a door thatâs opening to a better world.â
But  McGowan  â who has herself accused Weinstein of rape and who has been a vocal advocate for the women who have come forward with their own stories â slammed Streepâs characterization of the claims against the producer  publicly chastising the 68-year-old three-time Oscar-winner on Twitter.
âNo  Meryl  ITâS A F***ING CRIME â  McGowan  wrote in a tweet. âYou are such a lie.â
 McGowan  has been one of the central figures in the allegations against Weinstein since the New York Times first reported that the producer struck a $100 000 financial settlement related to sexual misconduct with the actress in the 1990s.
 McGowan  claimed in a January interview published by the Guardian â before the allegations against Weinstein exposed a widespread scandal in Hollywood â that  she  had been blacklisted in the industry because of  her  experience.
In October   McGowan  told actor Ben Affleck to âf*ck offâ on Twitter after Affleck claimed not to have known about the allegations against Weinstein  with whom he collaborated on 1998âs Good Will Hunting.

input: SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - One of the most dramatic moments in an upcoming trade secrets trial between Alphabet Incâs Waymo and Uber will likely come when the former chief of Uberâs self-driving car unit takes the witness stand  as he is expected to repeatedly refuse to answer questions.
 Waymo  sued Uber Technologies Inc last year  claiming that  former Waymo engineer Anthony Levandowski  downloaded more than 14 000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company  called Otto  which Uber acquired soon after.
 Levandowski   regarded as a visionary in autonomous technology  is not a defendant in the case but is on  Waymo âs witness list.  Waymo  has accused Uber of benefiting from  Waymo  technology that  it  says Uber acquired through  Levandowski . Uber has denied Waymoâs allegations and has argued that the data in the files were not trade secrets.
During a pretrial deposition in April  Waymo lawyers questioned Levandowski for hours about allegations that he took Waymoâs trade secrets. He declined to answer any questions about his time at both companies  citing constitutional protections against self-incrimination over 300 times  according to a deposition transcript. Levandowski has never publicly addressed the allegations of taking the documents and law enforcement has not charged anyone with their theft.
Uber  Waymo and Miles Ehrlich  an attorney for Levandowski  declined to comment.
Elizabeth Rowe  a trade secret expert at the University of Florida Levin College of Law  said Levandowski refusing to answer questions on the stand  and the judgeâs instructions around it  would hurt Uberâs case because it would reinforce  Waymoâs  arguments that  he  was deceptive and took their information.
To counter  Levandowskiâs  expected refusal to answer questions  Rowe said Uber should tell jurors in opening statements that the companyâs actions and those of Levandowski are separate  stressing that Uber fired the engineer last May.
Alsup granted Waymoâs request for a pretrial injunction in May  prohibiting Levandowski from working on Lidar  a sensor technology for self-driving cars that is the crux of the current litigation.
If  Waymo  persuades a jury that Uber stole  its  trade secrets  it said it would seek a permanent injunction to prohibit Uber from using them in the future.
Other tech executives who could testify at trial include former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick  Benchmark venture capitalist Bill Gurley  and Waymo CEO John Krafcik  court documents showed.

input: Nine years after  Bill Buckley âs death  reflecting on his Catholic life
William F. Buckley Jr. died nine years ago today. When I announced his death on the website  a stream of e-mails poured in testifying to what an impact he had on people âs  lives by his presence â in print  on television  and in person. Person after person told of the one time they met him  and in each case the story was nearly identical:  Bill  treated them like they were the most important person in the world. Priests and at least one religious sister shared the influence his public Catholicism had on them. Others said that while their own father wasnât in the picture when they were growing up   Bill  was a reliable presence in their lives with wisdom  even if only via Firing Line.
When I interviewed  Bill  for Crisis back in the mid Nineties   he  inspired me with two comments: One  that  he  prayed the Rosary every day. Two  that  he  had had a love affair with Jesus Christ since his childhood  when He answered his prayers about his mother  who was going through a very difficult pregnancy.
Following the interview  I began describing  Bill  as the Saint Paul of the modern conservative movement. Saint Paul because (a)  Bill  was a true believer in  his  faith and philosophy  spreading both wherever  he  traveled; and (b)  he  was an apostle of caritas. âThough I speak with the tongues of men and angels  and have not love  I am no better than a clanging gong or a brass bell.â So many  many acts of charity throughout his life. He proselytized for conservatism for nearly 60 years  sustained by his deep faith.
 Bill  was the opposite of ostentatious in  his  religious observances. But any close friend could see that prayer occupied an important place in the spiritual economy of  his  life. I think  he  would have liked what the novelist Anthony Trollope had to say about such matters. In the late 1850s  Trollope wrote:
I suppose we might cavil over the deflationary phrase âamuse himselfâ â perhaps âengageâ or âoccupyâ would have been better â but in essentials  I think  Bill  would have smiled on Trollopeâs enumeration of duties. And it was the prelude  the recognition that our sojourn here on earth is ineluctably short  be it full of years or  like that of Lessingâs son  numbered in hours only  that distributes weight to the obligations articulated.
Pascal expresses the discomfiting aspect of this humbling recognition  the side that pushes people into graduate seminars in philosophy and the therapistâs couch.  Bill  did not have much time for this allotrope of existential anxiety.  He  recognized  as  he  put it in  his  magnificent account of  his  visit to Lourdes  that âfrom the day of birth  we are on our deathbed.â But if  he  found in it a private inspiration to prayer   he  publicly embraced it as a goad to action and enjoyment  not paralysis.  His  focus was adamantly outward  blissfully with the particularities of  his  latest adventure. Socrates may or may not have been right that âthe unexamined life is not worth living.â  Bill  indisputably demonstrated that the unexamined world just wonât cut it. âThe entertainment committee â  he  liked to say  ânever sleeps.â
Our secular age is unfriendly to Catholics  to religion generally  but the irony is that secularists are often less jubilantly worldly than their Jewish and Christian compatriots. âGod made the world and saw that it was good.â That bulletin from Genesis might have been the motto of  Bill Buckleyâs  life.  He  certainly did everything  he  could to broadcast it among  his  many friends. I have never known a more generous person. I do not mean only materially generous  though Billâs largesse in that department was legendary. I mean spiritually  constitutionally generous as well.
Billâs generosity was perhaps most solicitous in matters touching on religious faith. I think of  his  account  alternately moving and amusing  of the last days of  his  National Review colleague Frank Meyer. In  his  last illness  Meyer struggled with the momentous decision of whether to convert to Catholicism.  Bill  was a tireless emissary between Meyer and various confidants.  Bill  reports that Meyer  from his bed of woe  complained that âthe only remaining intellectual obstacle to his conversion was the collectivist implication lurking in the formulation âthe communion of saintsâ in the Apostlesâ Creed.â Two days before the end  Meyer somehow overcame that final obstacle  partly  I like to think  with the help of Billâs armory of arguments.
Another anecdote: Everyone knows that  Bill  commanded a formidable vocabulary. It was significant  therefore  that he should have telephoned us once in search of a word. âIt means taking pleasure in the misfortune of others â he said to my wife. âSchadenfreude?â she ventured. âThatâs it!â he said and rang off. How perfectly Buckleyesque that he should have forgotten it. It named an emotion that was as foreign to him as joy was native.
When I met  Mr. Buckley   I was a sophomore in college  and even at a distance of all these years  I know that what most struck me about  him  then was what might be called a certain Catholic matter-of-factness: not in the sense of nonchalance in approaching matters of faith  but just the opposite. From  his  lifetime of familiarity with the Lord came an ease of conversation about  Him  and a givenness that  his  life was firmly situated within the context of a lived discipleship in the middle of the Church.
 Father Gerald E. Murray
Bill Buckley  went on pilgrimage to Our Ladyâs shrine in Lourdes a few years before  he  set out on the final pilgrimage to eternity. I was a chaplain on that trip and spent time with  Bill .  He  remarked that at Lourdes  he  felt completely free from the ordinary sense of time and schedules.  He  must have experienced the heavenly sense of Lourdes. When the Blessed Virgin Mary came down to speak with Bernadette Soubirous in 1858  eternity entered into time and left a lasting mark on a faraway corner of France. Time is a measurement of change; eternity is beyond change  for it is the perfection of everything we seek when we pursue the true  the good  and the beautiful.
 Bill  spent  his  lifetime resisting those who impossibly sought to âimmanentize the eschatonâ by violence  deceit  and deception. The eschaton is reserved for the next life. A sweet foretaste  however  is offered when and where God chooses to intervene in human history. Lourdes is such a place  and  Bill  knew by conviction  and now by experience  that Catholicism blesses her children with such joyful experiences of the fundamental truth that God is good. That joy transports us  if only for a moment  out of the limited horizon of daily life. That joy allows us to return to our daily schedule knowing it all has a meaning and higher purpose as we journey to eternity.  Bill Buckley  was a pilgrim who sought and upheld truth and goodness in the great struggle against the 20th centuryâs promoters of lies and evil. We are all in his debt. Requiescat in pace.

 CHP Officer Joseph Rodriguez cracked open the door of his patrol car on Monday  squeezing between his black-and-white and the traffic whizzing by.
 He passed the telltale scratches on the fender  like those found on most CHP patrol cars  made by officers' equipment belts as they cling to their vehicles for safety.
 On Monday  Rodriguez cruised up and down the 101 Freeway  on the lookout for speeders  tailgaters  cell phone yappers and beltless motorists.
 After he got married in November  he said he became especially conscious of the risk of pulling drivers onto the shoulder.
 When he'd ordered a woman to pull off the freeway last week  she'd paid no heed to his public address system. And after they'd rolled onto the shoulder  he'd almost got hit by the flying roof of a trailered Volkswagen.
 Six months ago  a car ran off the road on the Freeway 170  missing him by 20 feet.
 ""We're all out there doing the exact same job "" Rodriguez said  after removing his brimmed cap after issuing a warning for cell phone use. ""These officers were doing everything right.
