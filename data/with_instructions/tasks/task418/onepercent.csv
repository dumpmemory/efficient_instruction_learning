input: In a letter posted on the White House web site Tuesday  John Brennan  assistant to President Barack Obama for homeland security and counterterrorism  said Schmidt will have regular access to the president and play a vital role in the country's security.
 Schmidt's selection comes more than 10 months after Obama declared cyber security a priority and ordered a broad administration review.
 A senior White House official said Obama was personally involved in the selection process and chose Schmidt because of his unique background and skills. Schmidt will have regular and direct access to the president for cyber security issues  the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the selection process.
 At the same time  cyber experts and potential job candidates have complained that the position lacks the budgetary and policy-making authority needed to be successful. Schmidt will report to the National Security Council and closely support the National Economic Council on cyber issues.
 Schmidt's selection suggests that economic and business interests in the White House held more sway in the selection process. Schmidt  president and CEO of the Information Security Forum  a nonprofit international consortium that conducts research in information security  has served as chief security officer for Microsoft and as cyber security chief for online auction giant eBay. He was reportedly preferred by Lawrence Summers  director of the economic council. A good format for the titel can be the simple subject + object + verb.

input: The clock has finally run out for an Upper East Side judge who ridiculed a lawyer with cerebral palsy and allowed cases involving tenants without heat or hot water to drag on   sources told The Post . The Manhattan Housing Court ’ s advisory council   which reviews its judges after each four - year term   recently ruled that jurist Susan Avery should get the boot — as it catalogued years of complaints against her   sources said . Avery ’ s chief - judge boss is now set to follow through on the recommendation by the end of the year   sources said . “ Considering the complaints against her   it ’ s about time for her to leave the bench  ” said Alan Flacks   a longtime local resident pushing for judicial reform . Avery   52   of East 84th Street   landed her $ 175   000 - a - year job in 2012 thanks to a political appointment by then - Chief Judge Gail Prudenti . But she started demonstrating poor judgment almost immediately from the bench   according to the 14 - member Advisory Council for the Housing Part of the Civil Court of New York City . In 2013   Avery reprimanded a lawyer with cerebral palsy for his sloppy handwriting   the panel said in its four - page finding   which called the judge “ unfeeling .’’ The incident resulted in a letter of caution being placed in Avery ’ s file   according to a court source . The council — comprised of representatives from both the real - estate industry and tenants ’ organizations appointed by the mayor and governor — also criticized Avery for “ excessive multi - week adjournments ” for cases involving lack of heat and hot water   said the letter   a copy of which was read to The Post . The advisory council said in its decision last month that the New York Law School grad showed a general “ lack of concern ” for the litigants before her . The council added it was “ disturbed further ” by conflicts of interests involving the Housing Court judge ’ s family real - estate holdings . A court source said  Avery  failed to disclose that a law firm administering a family trust also regularly represents landlords in cases before the judge . Meanwhile   the jurist garnered a “ not approved ” rating by the city Bar Association — twice . Voters also refused to back her two bids to move up to civil court . In the summer of 2016    a judge who was running against Avery for a civil - court position  lodged a complaint over her campaign tactics . Justice Sabrina Kraus   who was appointed to the bench in 2005   accused Avery ’ s boyfriend of making derogatory comments about her Iranian heritage on Facebook .  Avery  failed to disavow the remarks   showing ethnic bias   the advisory panel added . Kraus beat  Avery  to win the seat .  Avery  ran for civil court again this year but lost in the September primary .  Avery  did not respond to multiple requests for comment . The former chief judge who appointed her   Prudenti   said she had no memory of choosing her .

Who:  Cara  and Jesse Nuno
How much: $272 261 in five years 
Cara  and  Jesse Nuno  (Photo: NerdWallet.com)
Six years ago   Cara  and  Jesse Nuno  could not imagine a debt-free life.
 Cara : I think I had suggested [going to a credit counselor] in the past  but at the time Jess was too proud to talk to  them .
Jesse: In 2012  I can’t remember if we saw the advertisement [for the agency] on TV or not  but somehow it just kinda clicked  so we went to  them .  They  gave us April’s number.
April (credit counselor): The majority of  their  debt was old and in collections  so they were really at the “cleanup stage” and [handling each debt] one at a time more than all together. They used a mix of different techniques to address the collections. Some needed to be disputed as already paid or invalid. They also had some that appeared to be past the statute of limitations  so they first needed to verify this with an attorney and then dispute. Others they settled on  but most they made paid in full.
 Cara :  We  kept looking each month at what  we  had and the progress  we  had made. Slowly but surely  as  we  disputed and paid down  our  debts   our  credit scores went up.
 Jesse : Same for me. I was looking forward to the future where one day   we ’d be able to buy things again.
April: When  Jesse  and Cara first came to me in 2012  their credit scores were 536 and 584  respectively. As of 2016  Cara’s was 667 and  Jesse ’s was 758.
 Jesse : I seem to be sleeping better at night  not tossing and turning like I used to  figuring how I’m going to pay this or how I’m going to pay that. It takes its toll — I got the gray hair to prove it.
 Cara :  We ’d like to do some work on the house and get  our  vehicles paid off. Now  we  have a budget  and Jess pays all  our  bills early.
 Cara : It’s OK to ask for counseling to get started with a plan to get your debt paid off. Don’t be embarrassed to ask for help because you’re not the only person that’s been there.

 McHugh could not be reached for comment. His attorney  Greg Stannard  said he had not had time to review the case and could not comment.
 McHugh is under a court order to sell all his rental properties in Los Angeles by the fall of 2010 as part of a plea agreement to avoid jail time for fire and habitability violations.
 City officials have been trying to regulate McHugh for decades. In the 1980s  then-City Attorney Ira Reiner accused McHugh  now 84  of dealing in ""blood money"" and threatened to put him in jail.
 But the landlord continued to amass buildings and a record of violating health and safety codes. Last summer  his lawyer told city officials that he owned more than 140 properties  housing about 8 000 people  many of them impoverished immigrants in the city's core.
 Tenants and their advocates say the conditions in his buildings caused health risks such as lead poisoning  asthma and ear infections caused by allergy to cockroaches.

 Judge Roy Moore  speaks as  he  participates in the Mid-Alabama Republican Club's Veterans Day Program in Vestavia Hills  Alabama  U.S.  November 11  2017. REUTERS/Marvin Gentry
Trump’s position did not go as far as other Republican leaders in Washington who have said they believe the women accusing the former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice and have demanded  Moore  withdraw from the race before the Dec. 12 vote.
“The president said in his statement earlier this week that if the allegations are true  then  Roy Moore  should step aside. He still firmly believes that ” she said.
Asked if the president’s endorsement of  Moore  still stands  Sanders said Trump thinks Alabama voters should decide the winner of the race.
In the past week  multiple women have accused  Moore  of sexual improprieties or unwanted romantic advances they said occurred decades ago. Some of the women were teenagers at the time  and he was in his 30s.
Before the allegations surfaced   Moore  was heavily favored to defeat Democrat Doug Jones in the special election next month.
 Moore  scored a decisive Republican primary victory in September over Luther Strange  who was appointed to fill the vacant seat after Jeff Sessions became U.S. attorney general earlier this year.
Trump backed Strange in the primary but threw his support to  Moore  after Strange’s defeat.

input: Face masks are placed on children in Antananarivo   Madagascar   on Tuesday . ( Alexander Joe / Associated Press ) Some might consider the plague a thing of the past   buried deep in medieval history . But it thrives in Madagascar   where the disease is a seasonal worry . And this year   the country is experiencing what may be its deadliest outbreak in years : About 194 people are suspected to have fallen ill from the plague since August   and 33 have died as of Saturday   according to Madagascar ’ s Ministry of Health . Experts say they can ’ t remember the last time the death toll was so high . In 2016   63 people died over the course of the year   out of 275 cases . The majority of this year ’ s cases are pneumonic plague   which can be transmitted through coughing   according to the BBC . This form of the disease can kill an infected person in less than a day . To slow the outbreak   Madagascar is temporarily shutting down its public institutions . Government authorities ordered two universities to close   and other schools have shut their doors across the country   including the capital   Antananarivo   so buildings can be sprayed with insecticides . The World Health Organization has shipped more than a million doses of antibiotics to the country   the BBC reported . “ We are scared — all of these deaths show that the situation is serious  ” Miora Herinjatovo   55   told Agence France - Presse on Wednesday . She got a mask from a hospital — unlike her husband   who failed to get one after standing in line outside a pharmacy . He instead collected a handful of generic antibiotics . [ The plague   alive and well in Madagascar ] Experts say the outbreak started in late August   when a 31 - year - old man from the eastern city of Toamasina took a trip inland to Ankazobe   where the plague lives in rodent and flea populations . While there   he came down with malaria - like symptoms . He died in a taxi home   passing through Antananarivo   the WHO said in a Sept . 28 statement . The WHO said that many of the cases identified are directly or indirectly linked to the man   which is evidence of person - to - person transmission . Of the 31 people who made direct or indirect contact with him   four became ill and died   the WHO said . Antananarivo and Toamasina were among the most - infected cities : As of Sept . 30   Antananarivo and its suburbs had 27 cases and seven deaths   and Toamasina had 18 cases and five deaths . Antananarivo has about 1 . 3 million residents   while Toamasina has about 237   000   according to a 2014 count by the National Institute of Statistics in Madagascar . Public gatherings   including jazz festivals and basketball tournaments   have been called off to prevent the plague from spreading   according to media reports . One of the people killed by the plague last week was a basketball coach from the Seychelles   who died while visiting the capital for a tournament   according to a WHO report released Thursday . “ Right now   we have the outbreak of a very infectious   fatal disease  ” said Katharina Kreppel   an epidemiologist at the Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania   who spent four years conducting field research in Madagascar . “ If people don ’ t notice fast enough   or don ’ t have access to health care fast enough   they die very quickly .” [ There ’ s plague in Arizona . Authorities warn of fleas that can infect people and pets .] This plague shares the same bacterium   yersinia pestis   that caused the “ Black Death ” pandemic in Europe during the 14th century . The most common form of the plague in Madagascar was   until this year   the bubonic plague   spread to humans through infected fleas that contracted the infection from small animals they bit   like rats . The disease is typically spread to humans by the bite of an infected flea   according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The bubonic plague is often treatable with antibiotics . If left untreated   though   the bacteria can spread through the bloodstream to the lungs and cause pneumonic plague — a deadly   more infectious form that ’ s now spreading throughout Madagascar . Symptoms of the pneumonic plague are similar to the common cold   according to the CDC . The symptoms of bubonic plague are fever   headaches   chills and weakness — as well as one or more swollen and painful lymph nodes   known as buboes . The bacteria multiply in the lymph node closest to where the bacteria entered the body   usually through the infected flea bite   according to the CDC . If an infected person isn ’ t given antibiotics   the bacteria can spread to other parts of the body . Should the bubonic plague become pneumonic   the person will develop shortness of breath   chest pain and sometimes bloody or watery mucous . The pneumonia may cause respiratory failure and shock . All forms of plague   if untreated   can progress rapidly to death   according to the CDC . There have been three major plague pandemics : The Justinian plague   which broke in the Byzantine Empire in AD 541 ; the “ Black Death  ” which originated in China in 1334 and spread to Europe ; and the Modern Plague   which began in China in the 1860s and appeared in Hong Kong by 1894   according to the CDC . It was during the last pandemic that scientists identified the link between the bacteria and infectious flea bites   and rat - associated plague was soon brought under control in most urban areas . The plague has since been controlled in most countries with insecticides   according to the CDC . And since it can be treated with antibiotics   the spread of the disease is usually prevented if promptly identified . The plague is most commonly found in sub - Saharan Africa and Madagascar   areas which account for more than 95 percent of reported cases   according to the CDC . Madagascar often sees the highest numbers of bubonic plague cases worldwide   about 600 infections annually . Madagascar has been in the throes of a political crisis since 2009 and has become one of the poorest countries in the world   with more than 92 percent of the population living on less than $ 2 a day   according to the World Bank Group . It ’ s lost a substantial portion of international aid   and its infrastructure has deteriorated . Once rice harvest season finishes at the end of summer   the rat population drops   as they don ’ t have as much food . Fleas begin looking for new hosts to bite and settle on humans . As it is an island   Madagascar is home to species that transmit the plague and often aren ’ t found anywhere else    Kreppel  told The Washington Post . While Madagascar ’ s scientists have monitored plague patterns for years and have the knowledge to mitigate the spread of this new   pneumonic plague   the money and resources to do so aren ’ t available    Kreppel  said . There isn ’ t adequate funding for insecticides   spraying equipment or antibiotics   she said   and there aren ’ t enough health facilities to house quarantined patients . The country can ’ t afford the vehicles required to travel to isolated villages   should the disease spread further    Kreppel  said . “ If an outbreak like this happened in the U . S . or Europe or anywhere else it would be controlled quite fast   because the resources are there  ” she said . This post has been updated .

Now complete the following example-
input: But  President Donald J. Trump  hardly looked like a grand wizard a week ago today. On January 8   he  hosted Alveda King  the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; Isaac Newton Farris Jr.  Dr. King’s nephew  and Bruce Levell of the National Diversity Coalition for  Trump . All three of  Trump ’s guests are black.
“I did about 200 cataract surgeries with a group of surgeons in Haiti and the same in Central America ” Senator Paul  an ophthalmologist  said on NBC’s Meet the Press yesterday. “And when we asked  Donald J. Trump  as a private citizen to support those trips   he  was a large financial backer of both medical mission trips.” Paul continued: “I think it’s unfair then to sort of all of a sudden paint him  ‘Oh well   he ’s a racist ’ when I know  for a fact  that  he  cares very deeply about the people in Haiti because  he  helped finance a trip where we were able to get vision back for 200 people in Haiti.”
Whatever  Trump  said or didn’t say  the reaction has been beyond incendiary  with the words “racist” and “racism” erupting like volcanos around the Pacific Ring of Fire.
 Trump’s  alleged language  if uttered  was unfortunate  vulgar  and unpresidential  although  he  hardly would have been the first chief executive to use profanity in office.  His  supposed words apparently were aimed at sh**hole nations  rather than sh**hole people. The latter would have been inexcusable.
It is widely understood that certain nations are garden spots  and others are not. It is fair to say that Haiti  El Salvador  and a tragically high number of African countries are non-garden spots. It also is perfectly appropriate to ask whether America would be better off with immigrants from such impoverished and embattled places or from prosperous nations  such as Norway  which  Trump  reportedly mentioned. It likely was top of mind  given Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg’s visit and joint press conference with him on Wednesday.
Whatever he stated or didn’t   President Trump  should learn these lessons from this experience  and repeat them to  himself  daily:
“Every word I say matters.” This is true in public  in private  and around the clock  until  he  leaves the White House and begins work on the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library.
 Trump  should think of  himself  as Jim Carrey in the 1998 film The Truman Show. Except when  he  is in bed   Trump  should behave as if every breath  he  takes were being broadcast live around the globe.
 Trump  needs to remember that Democrats are not  his  pals. They almost universally crave  his  failure  resist  his  program  and want to yank  him  from office — never mind the 304 votes  he  legitimately won in the Electoral College. Anything  he  says in front of Democrats (and even some Never  Trump  Republicans  alas) can and will be used against  him  in the court of public opinion.  Senator Durbin  should be condemned for publicizing (or distorting)  his  private conversation with  Trump   thus sabotaging efforts to reach a DACA deal. But this should be no more shocking than if  somewhere in Illinois  a rooster crowed at dawn.
 Trump  needs to remember that Democrats are not  his  pals.
Ned Ryun of American Majority has an excellent idea: Whenever  President Trump  meets with Democrats   he  should summon news cameras and let them stay until Democrats leave. Trump displayed his leadership skills to almost universal applause when he allowed the media to broadcast live for 55 minutes from the Cabinet Room  as he negotiated immigration and border security last Tuesday. Doing this regularly when Democrats are around will prevent them from offering journalists an alternative version of events. With cameras present  Trump should be on his best behavior. And the American people will benefit from Senate-floor-like transparency inside the White House. This would be unprecedented and gain Trump considerable respect for opening a virtual sunroof atop the West Wing.
Trump’s job is to recall at all times  with the relentlessness of a bloodhound chasing an escaped Death Row inmate  that he must not give free knives and anvils to people who hate his guts and literally would cheer if he woke up dead tomorrow morning . (And the Left need not bother to deny this. Everyone knows this is true  as evidenced by the Left’s repeated fantasies about Trump being shot  stabbed  and decapitated.) These people would call  Trump  a racist for ordering vanilla ice cream.  He  should remember this without fail and act accordingly.
If  Trump  becomes blurry about this fact   he  should remember the very first fake-news story to emerge on  his  watch. On January 20  during  his  very first day as president  Time magazine’s Zeke Miller reported that Trump removed a bust of Dr. Martin Luther King from the Oval Office. This confirmed that  Trump  was a racist who couldn’t wait to evict that troublemaking black from  his  new office.

BuzzFeed News reported that the driver had alleged  Winston  grabbed her crotch during a ride in Scottsdale  Arizona in March 2016.  Winston  has denied the allegation.
 Winston  is now being probed by the NFLâs special counsel for investigations  Lisa Friel  who had written to the quarterbackâs accuser.
âThe League has been informed that you may have been the victim of such a violation perpetrated by Tampa Bay Buccaneers player Jameis Winston â Friel wrote in the letter.
 Winston   23  issued a statement in response to the BuzzFeed report  denying the allegations.
âA news organization has published a story about me regarding an alleged incident involving a female Uber driver from approximately two years ago â  Winston  said.
 Winston  is in  his  third season with Tampa Bay after being the top pick in the 2015 draft.
 His  college career had been dogged by controversy  including a 2012 allegation of rape by a fellow student at Florida State.  Winston  did not face charges following the incident.

input: OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo  speaks to the media during  his  visit in Abuja  Nigeria Febuary 27  2017. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - OPECâs Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo on Tuesday called on U.S. shale oil producers to help curtail global oil supply  warning extraordinary measures might be needed next year to sustain the rebalanced market in the medium to long term.
âWe urge our friends  in the shale basins of North America to take this shared responsibility with all seriousness it deserves  as one of the key lessons learnt from the current unique supply-driven cycle â said  Barkindo .
âAt the moment we (OPEC and independent U.S. producers) both agreed that we have a shared responsibility in maintaining stability because they are also not insulated from the impact of this downturn â  Barkindo  said  referring to a slide in oil prices that spurred OPEC to agree production cuts late last year.
While OPEC and some other producers  including Russia have cut supplies this year in order to prop up prices  U.S. production has soared by almost 10 percent this year  driven largely by shale drillers.  Barkindo  said  he  hoped that new producers  not just U.S. shale drillers  would join production cuts.
âDemand-supply is returning to rebalance through massive destocking that we have been witnessing of stocks in OECD across regions in a very massive way â  Barkindo  said later  speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the conference.
âIn the past four months alone  we have seen destocking to the tune of 130 million bpd â  he  said.
The aim of the OPEC-led cut is to trim the level of oil in OECD industrialized countries compared with the five-year supply average.  Barkindo  said the stock overhang to the five-year average stood at 171 million barrels in August  against 338 million at the start of the year.
âThe speed and pace (of destocking) has accelerated as a result of anticipated and projected demand growth in the second half of 2017 to the tune of 2 million bpd. We are witnessing a fast return to a balanced market â  Barkindo  said.
Still  on  Sunday Barkindo  said OPEC and other oil producers might need to take âsome extraordinary measuresâ next year to rebalance the oil market.
World oil demand growth in 2017 is expected at 1.45 million barrels per day (BPD) and it should stay around 1.4 million bpd in 2018   Barkindo  said.  He  said Indiaâs share of global oil demand is expected to rise to over 9 percent by 2040  up from 4 percent now.

Now complete the following example-
input: But Gaga has spent the past three years deconstructing her previous project  which is its own kind of performance. Elaborate dance pop ceded ground to jazz standards  showtunes  and country rock. Tentacle gowns went into the closet; jeans and a pink cowboy hat came out. The director Chris Moukarbel shot Five Foot Two largely on handheld—maybe even smartphone—cameras. You see Gaga cooking  recording  planning  crying  bonding. In one scene  she’s topless as she chats with her team by the poolside. The implication: This is Gaga  au naturel. Yet she never seems to forget the camera. Five Foot Two documents last year’s release of her album Joanne  and makes clear how much Gaga’s public reboot relied on demonstrating that she  like everyone else  suffers. Gaga has increasingly mined the traumas of her own life  with songs and philanthropic efforts growing out of her rape at age 19. The dissolution of her engagement to the actor Taylor Kinney  mournfully referenced a few times in the documentary  seemed to inform the breakup-themed Joanne singles “Perfect Illusion” and “Million Reasons.” But there was a deeper source of anguish on  Joanne   too. The album is named for  her  aunt  an aspiring artist who died of lupus at age 19 in 1974. “Seeing what that did to [my father] and my family was the most powerful thing I experienced growing up ” Gaga tells the journalist Darryl Pinckney in the film. “I am Joanne. I am my father’s daughter. That is what this record is about.”
The most memorable scene of the documentary comes when she first plays the album’s delicate  acoustic title track for her grandmother   Joanne’s  mom. The moment verges on uncomfortable  and not only because Gaga’s father   Joanne’s  brother  gets up and leaves the room in apparent distress midway through. Gaga herself seems hungry to have her telling of an ordeal she did not personally experience validated by those who did. “Did I get it right?” she asks her grandmother  mid-hug. “Yes you did ” her grandmother responds. But she has a warning for Gaga  too: “Don’t become maudlin over all this.” For now  Gaga is asking not for applause but understanding. It’s never explicitly stated  but Gaga seems to connect to  Joanne ’s story in part because of  her  own medical situation. Iconography about hospitals and crutches and wheelchairs over the years hinted that the seemingly bionic pop star faced problems of the flesh off-stage. In 2010   she  told Larry King  she  tested “borderline positive” for lupus.  She ’s still feeling the effects of the injury  she  sustained in 2013  as seen in a Five Foot Two moment when  she  pauses rehearsals for  her  Super Bowl halftime show because of hip tightness.  Fibromyalgia  appears to make that problem worse  and being a pop star in chronic pain certainly doesn’t seem easy. One scene shows  her  having  her  makeup done for a performance while sitting in a doctor’s examination room.
Gaga’s particular ailment is an almost-literal rendering of Jamison’s “pain without a cause”—which is  as  she  notes  “pain which can’t be trusted.” A poorly understood but widespread disorder that seems to inordinately affect women  fibromyalgia is sometimes assumed to be psychosomatic. “Drug Approved. Is Disease Real?” read a 2008 New York Times headline about the first FDA-sanctioned drug to treat it. Gaga has said that she wants to help raise awareness and research dollars. During one excruciating flare-up shown in Five Foot Two  she sympathizes with less-privileged sufferers of the disorder: “Like  I don’t know what I’d fuckin’ do if I didn’t have everybody here to help me.” A few moments later  she’s looking straight into the camera. “Do I look pathetic?” she asks  tear-streaked  lying on a couch  a therapist massaging her. “I’m so embarrassed.” It’s a powerful moment because the stigma of pain is clearly part of the pain itself. But it’s also aesthetically striking. To answer Gaga’s question  she actually looks like she did in parts of the “Bad Romance” video—crying  stripped down  and oddly luminous. It’s a sign of fame’s power on the viewer: Whatever lengths she might go to put person over persona  the persona remains. * * * Pop music has firmly moved on from the phase of gleeful  Technicolor artifice that Gaga stood for at her peak. Contemporaries in wildness like Kesha and Miley Cyrus have done much what Gaga has done and traded Alexander McQueen creations for cowboy boots. They have also made a diaristic turn  harmonizing their music with their angsty  tabloid sagas.
Usually this means trading on the spectacle of suffering to sell pop’s ultimate commodity—inspiration. Beyoncé’s Lemonade is the signal example  taking the sting of infidelity to spin a tale of hurt and overcoming. Kesha’s alleged abuse by her mentor and producer Dr. Luke was addressed and transcended on this year’s Rainbow. Katy Perry marketed her latest album with an on-camera therapy session in which she cried about her “real” self wanting to be known. Taylor Swift seems on the verge of unveiling a more acidic survival story. “Victim to victory” songs are always in fashion  but the latest boom relies  more than pop usually does  on the feeling of authenticity. Adult listeners of drive-time radio typically know they’re in the realm of fantasy and commerce  yet fully enjoying the confessional-pop performance means buying into the non-musical narratives surrounding them. Beyoncé rolled her own child and husband into the Lemonade visual experience. “I write this shit  baby ” Kesha insisted on a recent single. You’re explicitly asked to believe that the gap between performer and person is negligible.  Joanne  already fit into this triumphant-confessional class  with Gaga singing about family members and friends by name and roaring  “I might not be flawless but you know I’ve got a diamond heart.” The meta-text  all along  was Gaga’s own career arc—a sense that  she ’d come down from the heights  she ’d reached from 2008 to 2013  stumbled with  her  third album  and might never recover. Glimmers of past traumas and family tragedy contributed to the pathos.  Her  medical troubles would seem to retroactively add in a new layer  though it’s unclear when  she  received  her  fibromyalgia diagnosis  and little on the album can be heard as an explicit reference to illness. Certainly the lyrics about healing through love on  her  post- Joanne  single  “The Cure ” now seem a lot less generic.

input: If  Corey   Crawford âs âupper-bodyâ injury keeps  him  out the rest of the season  which was a possibility indicated by Sportsnetâs Elliotte Friedman  then the Blackhawks will have a âlower-standingsâ issue.
When  Crawford  was placed on the injured list on Dec. 27  the Hawks were two points behind the Wild for the second wild-card spot  but held two games in hand.
Without  Crawford   the Hawks have gone 5-4-1 and find themselves three points behind the eighth-seeded Kings  who also have a game in hand.
To recap  their lot without  Crawford  has become worse  and it could get a lot worse if  he  continues to suffer from vertigo again as reported by the Chicago Sun-Times.
 Crawford  has been the Hawksâ best player this season  and itâs not even close.  He  won a lot of games by  himself  when  his  teammates proved inept or inert.  His  play had been Vezina Trophy-worthy  and even now  his  .929 save percentage ranks third in the league while  his  2.27 goals-against average stands fifth overall.
It seems impossible to imagine the Hawks trading for  another Crawford  and they donât have an extra one handy. Jeff Glass has a better backstory than a future as a playoff goalie from what Iâve seen. Anton Forsberg seems earnest and talented  but his goals-against average is more than a half-goal worse than Crawfordâs  which is a bad thing for a once-dominant team that sadly sometimes canât score even a half-goal a game. See Sundayâs shutout-loss-tank-job against the dreaded Red Wings at home on Sunday.
The long-range view goes only to Feb. 26. Thatâs the trade deadline. The Hawks will play 18 games before then and have a little more than five weeks to get some good news on  Crawford .

input: In 2016   Lemonis  partnered with Parlour Enterprises  which operated the California Farrell's locations  to revive the brand in exchange for a 51 percent stake in the Farrell's trademark.
 Lemonis  entrusted Parlour Enterprise CFO Paul Kramer and  its  since-resigned CEO Mike Fleming with the task of revamping the restaurant.
Instead  Kramer and Fleming neglected the changes  Lemonis  had requested. The most successful Farrell's location  which once brought in over $4 million in sales  closed down because the owners' were behind on rent.
""I got basically a big F.U. and I have to decide whether I just want to cut my losses and move on because I don't want to throw good money after a bad situation ""  Lemonis  said.
When  Lemonis  investigated further into Farrell's demise   he  spoke with Lee  who had been working as a regional manager at the restaurant for nearly six years and was in charge of updating the restaurant's menu in 2016.
Lee admitted he wasn't able to do his job properly because of Kramer's resistance to change. After negotiating a new lease for Farrell's most successful location   Lemonis  agreed to help save the restaurant in exchange for a 75 percent stake in the company.
Unlike Fleming and Kramer  Lee did his best to help keep Farrell's afloat. ""For Travis  it's always about the customer  it's always about the employee  it's always about the company  "" Lemonis  said. ""It's never about him.""
That's why  Lemonis  went the extra step to acknowledge Lee's dedication to Farrell's.
""Thank yous are necessary but  let's be honest  they're not everything. So I want to give you a bonus  "" Lemonis  said. ""[This could] never have worked without you.""
The bonus not only showed  Lemonis'  gratitude for the extra effort Lee put into the business  it's also a tactic that could boost Lee's morale and productivity.
Lee  meanwhile  expressed his appreciation for  Lemonis'  leadership move and said the money would help his family.
Under Lee's new changes  the new Farrell's location is expected to make $4.2 million in revenue â which prompted  Lemonis  to called  him  a ""rockstar.""
""You have not only earned my trust but you have earned my respect ""  Lemonis  told Lee. ""You don't work for Farrell's  you're my partner at Farrell's.""
""You're not an employee. This is your business ""  he  added. ""Don't you ever forget that this is your business.""

The letter â which complains that the $95 million being spent on a new police academy would be better spent on schools â echoes comments directed at  Emanuel  by handfuls of hecklers at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor on Jan. 19  and at the University of California  Los Angeles  on Feb. 12.
In Los Angeles last week   Emanuel  laughed off the protests  telling  his  audience that  he  âdidnât realize there were that many direct flightsâ from Chicago. In Ann Arbor   Emanuel  attempted to engage the protesters  who continued to chant at  him . Some in the audience booed the hecklers.
But the Harvard protesters accuse  Emanuel  of doing too little to halt the decline in the size of Chicagoâs black population and write that  âAs future and current designers  urban planners  policy-makers  organizers and educators  we cannot disregard the people who are in danger because of Rahm Emanuelâs administration.â

Now complete the following example-
input: By any measure , the Mitt Romney for president campaign has had a painfully bad week . 
That day , Romney addressed the NAACP convention in Houston . 
The speech was poorly received , so much so that Romney , in an interview that afternoon on Fox Business , told host Neil Cavuto that he had ""expected"" boos . 
Some interpreted that comment as proof that Romney had actually wanted to be booed by the NAACP in order to rev up elements of the conservative base . 
The Romney campaign next reacted by whispering to the Drudge Report -LRB- which acts as a kind of message board for Romney -RRB- that it was seriously considering Condoleezza Rice as a running mate . 
Gillespie : Romney retroactively retired . 
Gillespie : Romney retroactively retired 02:44 . 
And it was that ""win the hour"" mentality that got the Romney campaign into much more serious trouble when the Obama campaign launched a big push on Romney 's business record the next day . 
Gergen : Obama 's charges vs. Romney do n't hold up . 
Thursday morning , the Obama campaign released a tough ad attacking the record of downsizing and outsourcing at Romney 's old firm , Bain Capital . 
The Romney campaign reacted with outrage . 
In support of the ad , Romney 's team argued that he had left Bain Capital in February 1999 ; the incidents alluded to by the Obama campaign all occurred after that date and had nothing to do with Romney . 
The first attack on Romney had been a jab , dropping Romney 's guard against the haymaker : On Friday , the Obama team counter-charged that it was Romney who was lying in his ads or who had committed a felony , lying on 140 official forms that he signed as CEO and sole shareholder of Bain between 1999 and 2002 . 
Romney now chased the Obama story , granting five TV interviews to reiterate his version of events . 
By Sunday , even Romney supporters were urging the thing he wants least : release of more income tax returns . 
And here again , what got Romney into the trouble was his war room . 
It was the too-fierce response to Attack 1 -- the adamant insistence that Romney had nothing , nothing to do with anything that happened at Bain after February 1999 -- that set up Romney for Attack 2 : Did he lie on SEC forms ? 
Yes , it is technically true that Romney ended his operational role at Bain before he ended his titular role . 
Romney 's core problem is this : He heads a party that must win two-thirds of the white working-class vote in presidential elections to compensate for its weakness in almost every demographic category . 
The white working class is the most pessimistic and alienated group in the electorate , and it especially fears and dislikes the kind of financial methods that gained Romney his fortune . 
Romney has a strong potential defense : Bain was in the business of making companies more efficient and profitable . 
However , it 's not an argument that appeals much to the voters Romney most intensely needs to win . 
And this time , by trying to do too much , the Romney war room may have blasted its own side with lethal friendly fire .

And it sounds like  he  wants options.
""I see my role as CEO to prepare as many people as I can to be CEO  and that's what I'm doing. And then the board makes a decision at that point in time ""  Cook  said in an interview with BuzzFeed News.
 Cook  gave the interview at Apple's new Chicago retail store  a flagship for the company as it looks to turn its locations into must-see attractions.
Apple's head of retail  Angela  Ahrendts  flanked Tim Cook during the interview . It's not surprising  she  was there  but it is notable for  Cook  to discuss succession next to  her .

Now complete the following example-
input: Pittsburgh Steelers offensive tackle Alejandro Villanueva is a former Army Ranger. While his team remained off the field for the national anthem  he stood by the tunnel with his hand over his heart. As the weekend descended into madness from the liberal media over President Trumpâs remarks about NFL players who take a knee during the Star-Spangled Banner  Villanueva proved to be Sundayâs hero.  Yet  Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin  who defended his team âs actions to remain off the field as avoiding playing politics  was disappointed the former Army Ranger visibly stood for the anthem.
âLike I said  I was looking for 100 percent participation  we were gonna be respectful of our football team â said  Tomlin . Guy torched  him :
Let me see if I've got this straight:  Tomlin  -- a Clinton donor and fundraiser -- is upset that Villanueva was not ""respectful of our football team"" because he decided to honor the country for which he's courageously risked his life by not snubbing the national anthem? This is the display of 'disunity' that bothers Tomlin?
Now  Fox Sports 1âs Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe joined  Tomlin   noting that Villanueva should have remained out of sight (via Mediaite) [emphasis mine]:
âIt didnât work for him to step out of the tunnel â Bayless said during Mondayâs edition of Undisputed. âIf  in fact  you had all agreed  you had voted whether a majority or unanimously  to do this as a team to stay up in the tunnel until the Anthem was done. And  Mike Tomlin  was clear.â Baylessâs colleague  Shannon Sharpe  agreed. âTeams  they always take the military mentality  because itâs all for one  one for all. Whatever we decide to do thatâs what weâre going to do.  He  went on  his  own. I get it.  He  was in the military. I commend  him  for  his  service. But in this situation if the team decided that we  all of us  were going to wait in the tunnel while the national anthem is being played  that was the protocol that should have been followed.â
The thing is no one in that universe gets it. No one. We can talk about free speech all day; the point is that 72 percent of Americans view Colin Kaepernick  who started this whole controversy in San Francisco  and  his  national anthem antics as unpatriotic. Thereâs a massive disconnect between the fans and the league. Americans are proud. They respect those who serve and when people take a knee  they see spit flying in the faces of those who have sacrificed to protect our freedoms here at home. Thereâs no changing that. If you have to explain  youâre losing. Sometimes itâs just wrong. And huddling in the tunnel like the Brits during the Blitz because no one could agree on something as simple as respecting and standing for the national anthem is just absurd. Maybe thatâs why Villanueva merchandise is going through the roof. For the bubble  this stunt didnât work  for everyone elseâthere was an American hero honoring our country. No one should be fired or suspended for taking a knee of course. They do deserve a kick in the teeth on social media  which was expected  and they shouldnât expect the intensity to subside.

2. Critics of  Trump ’s decision to end CSR payments seem to forget a federal judge called them unconstitutional and ordered that they stop. — Michael F. Cannon (@mfcannon) October 13  2017
--But the  Trump  administration is injecting turbulence into the Obamacare marketplaces by cutting off the payments just as insurers are finalizing their 2018 plan offerings. Losing the approximately $7 billion in annual payments  which reimburse insurers for discounting deductibles and co-payments for the lowest-income enrollees  is grounds for insurers to back out of their federal contracts to even sell plans next year. The administration had been making the payments on a month-to-month basis  prompting complaints by insurers about a lack of certainty as they tried to plan ahead.

 TRUMP TEMPERATURE
--Yesterday  President Trump  signed an anticipated executive order intended to circumvent certain ACA rules by making it easier for individuals and small business to buy alternative types of health insurance with lower prices but fewer benefits  The Post's Amy Goldstein reports.
""The White House and allies portray  the president’s  move as wielding administrative powers to accomplish what congressional Republicans have failed to achieve: fostering more coverage choices while tearing down the law’s insurance marketplaces "" Amy writes. ""The order represents  Trump ’s biggest step to date to reverse the health-care policies of the Obama administration  a central promise since last year’s presidential campaign.
""Critics  who include state insurance commissioners  most of the health-insurance industry and mainstream policy specialists  predict that a proliferation of these other kinds of coverage will have damaging ripple effects: driving up costs for consumers with serious medical conditions and prompting more insurers to flee the law’s marketplaces. Part of  Trump ’s action  they say  will spark court challenges over  its  legality.""
--It expands the availability of short-term insurance policies  which offer limited benefits as a bridge for people between jobs or young adults no longer eligible for their parents’ health plans. The Obama administration ruled that short-term insurance may not last for more than three months;  Trump  wants to extend that to nearly a year.
Of course   Trump  insisted yesterday that  he  was providing ""Obamacare relief"" in remarks shortly before signing the order. ""This will cost the United States government virtually nothing and people will have great  great  healthcare ""  he  said. ""And when i say people  I mean by the millions and millions.""

(Bill Gorman / AP) (Bill Gorman / AP)
A U.S. military official said that a military hostage team had flown to Pakistan Wednesday  prepared to fly the family out. The team did a preliminary health assessment of the family and had a transport plane ready to go. But sometime after daybreak there  as the family members were walking to the plane   Boyle  said  he  did not want to board.
Another U.S. official said  Boyle  was nervous about being in ""custody"" given  his  background.
 Boyle  was once married to Zaynab Khadr  the older sister of former Guantanamo Bay detainee Omar Khadr and the daughter of a late senior al-Qaida financier. Her father  Ahmed Said Khadr  and the family stayed with Osama bin Laden briefly when Omar Khadr was a boy.
Officials had discounted any link between that background and  Boyle 's capture  with one official describing it in 2014 as a ""horrible coincidence.""
The Toronto Star reported that  Boyle  spoke to  his  parents after  his  release. "" Josh  said  he  was doing pretty well for someone who has spent the last five years in an underground prison ""  his  father told the paper.
The release came together rapidly Wednesday. It happened nearly five years to the day after Coleman and  Boyle  lost touch with their families while traveling in a mountainous region near the Afghan capital of Kabul.
The couple set off in the summer 2012 for a journey that took them to Russia  the central Asian countries of Kazakhstan  Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan  and then to Afghanistan. Coleman's parents last heard from their son-in-law on Oct. 8  2012  from an internet cafe in what  Boyle  described as an ""unsafe"" part of Afghanistan.
 Boyle 's parents say their son told them in a letter that he and his wife tried to protect the children by pretending their signs of captivity were part of a game being played with guards.

Referring to strikes in which terrorists have attacked people using knives or vehicles   Duke  said ""Creating terror is their goal.""
 Duke  warned it was taking less time for terrorists to plan attacks as they could exploit ""safe spaces online"" to evade detection  the outlet noted.

Upset about damaging leaks of  his  calls with world leaders and other national security information   Trump  has ordered an internal investigation to find the leakers. Staffers  meanwhile  are so fearful of being accused of talking to the media that some have resorted to a secret chat app — Confide — that erases messages as soon as they’re read.
The chaos and competing factions that were a  Trump  trademark in business and campaigning now are starting to define his presidency  according to interviews with a dozen White House officials as well as other Republicans. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss internal White House dynamics and deliberations.
Staffers buzz privately about who is up and who is down  with many eagerly gossiping about which poor colleague gets an unflattering portrayal on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live.” For the past two weeks  it has been White House press secretary Sean Spicer. But aides said  Trump  was especially upset by a sketch that cast White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon as the Grim Reaper manipulating the president — who was ultimately relegated to a miniature desk  playing dolefully with an expandable toy.
[ Trump  turns Mar-a-Lago Club dinner table into an open-air situation room]
On Monday afternoon  as speculation of a staff shake-up was rife on cable news channels   Trump  made clear to a small group of reporters what  he  thought of  his  chief of staff: “Reince is doing a great job. Not a good job. A great job ” the president said.
The problem:  Trump  had yet to weigh in  and aides and advisers were loath to take sides without knowing for certain whether their often mercurial and erratic boss wanted to keep Flynn or cut him loose.
On Monday  after  Trump  made it through a joint news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau without being asked about Flynn  a group of reporters gathered outside Spicer’s office for more than 80 minutes. Spicer twice declined to answer questions about Flynn. When White House chief of staff Reince Priebus walked by  he was asked whether the president still had confidence in Flynn. Priebus gave no answer.
Not long after  Kellyanne Conway  the counselor to the president  said  Trump  had “full confidence” in Flynn. Yet a few minutes later  Spicer issued an official — and conflicting — statement  saying  Trump  was “evaluating the situation.”

Christopher Ruddy  a longtime friend of  Trump ’s who on Sunday publicly criticized Priebus in television and print interviews as being “in way over his head ” received calls from both the chief of staff and Jared Kushner — Trump’s son-in-law  senior adviser and enforcer — and said Monday that he thought the White House was working to remedy its challenges.
 Trump ’s legislative affairs team — headed by Rick Dearborn and Marc Short  both veterans of the Hill — is also considered well-liked  disciplined and professional. But congressional staffers say they have been given advance notice about some executive orders on topics such as cybersecurity and Guantanamo Bay that have never materialized  a delay they attribute to chaos within the West Wing.

input: Another conservative outsider  successful businessman and conservative state Representative Mike Braun of Jasper   has announced  he  is entering a 2018 Indiana Republican Senate Primary.
 Braun  is the founder and CEO of Meyer Distributing  a nationwide auto parts distribution company with locations in 38 states and headquartered in Jasper  Indiana.
AP reports  Braun  correctly observing that the increasingly bitter feud between Messer and Rokita is turning off voters.  He  says harsh words between the two will only tear down the eventual Republican nominee and boost incumbent Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly's re-election chances.
âI made my career in the private sector. Our country needs more people who can tackle big issues from perspectives gained from running a business and not a career politicianâs perspective â  Braun  stated in  his  announcement. âIâve spent my life building a business and creating jobs. I am running for US Senate because we need leaders who understand the real consequences of the failure of our federal government and are capable of delivering solutions for Hoosiers on issues like health care and tax reform.â
âJoe Donnelly has consistently voted with the liberals in Washington. Donnelly voted for Obamacare  Obamaâs radical Supreme Court justices  trillions in reckless spending and debt  and stood with Barack Obama as he worked to destroy this country. Now he is standing with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer as they block President Trumpâs efforts to bring real conservative change to Washington â charged  Braun .
âI am ready to go to Washington to deliver Donald Trump reinforcements as he takes on the DC swamp. Last yearâs presidential election showed that Hoosiers know outsiders with business experience are the countryâs best hope to fix the broken political system in Washington. Most importantly  Hoosiers want leaders who can break the hold career politicians have on the system and make conservative change happen. Itâs time to replace Joe Donnelly with a Hoosier conservative who can get the job done. That is what I will do in Washington â  Braun  said.
Braun  who has pledged to invest  his  own money to put  his  campaign on the same footing as the better-known Rokita and Messer is already emphasizing  his  outsider status.
""Last year's presidential election showed that Hoosiers know outsiders with business experience are the country's best hope to fix the broken political system in Washington ""  Braun  said in a statement.
 Braun  has also placed  himself  squarely behind President Trumpâs make America great again agenda  saying  he  pledged to help President Donald Trump ""as  he  takes on the D.C. swamp"" and incisively portraying Democratic incumbent Senator Joe Donnelly as an ally of liberals in Congress.
 Mike Braun  is a smart guy and successful businessman who spent the summer gauging interest among the Hoosier stateâs grassroots Republicans.  He âs got the resources to be competitive and  he âs clearly taken the lay of the political landscape and determined thereâs a hole in the marketplace for an outsider candidate.  He  will be a formidable candidate if  he  can stay the course of pushing the Trump MAGA agenda  while avoiding a mudwrestling match with Rokita and Messer.

input: MANCHESTER  England (Reuters) - British finance minister Philip Hammond defended capitalism as the only route to prosperity on Monday  in an attempt to counter the opposition Labour Partyâs increasingly popular vision for a more centrally-controlled economy.
In a speech to the ruling Conservative Party that contained only two new policy announcements   Hammond  also said that the governmentâs immediate task was to deal with the uncertainty for citizens and businesses resulting from Brexit.
 Hammond   who was sidelined by May during the election campaign  said last weekâs Labour Party conference showed it wanted to impose on Britain  the worldâs fifth largest economy  the âsocialist fantasyâ seen in Cuba  Venezuela or Zimbabwe.
âWe saw Labour in the raw  exposed for what it has sadly become: a party taken hostage by a clique of hard-left extremist infiltrators  people who despise Britainâs values and talk down our country â  Hammond  told Conservative Party activists.
Seeking to put the economy center-stage in the Conservativesâ pitch to voters   Hammond  said Britain could only hope to experience rising living standards âby harnessing the power of the market economyâ.
With opinion polls showing Labour gaining support   Hammond  aims to convince voters that Corbyn would make them poorer.
Labourâs leaders   he  said  âopenly proclaim their ambition to demolish our successful modern market economy and replace it with a back-to-the-future socialist fantasy with hundreds of billions of extra debt for the next generation to pay.â
âOur economy is not broken: It is fundamentally strong â  Hammond  said  while also accepting that a lack of progress in talks on Britainâs divorce settlement with the European Union and uncertainty over future ties were weighing on businesses.
âThe process of negotiating our exit from the EU has created uncertainty so investment has slowed as businesses wait for clarity â  Hammond  said.
 Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond  speaks at the Conservative Party's conference in Manchester  Britain October 2  2017. REUTERS/PHIL NOBLE
Business groups welcomed Hammondâs defense of free markets  but said the government needed to do much more.
 Hammond  pledged 400 million pounds ($535 million) of additional road and rail spending and 10 billion pounds of funding to help young Britons get on the property ladder.
âWe must never deny or dismiss the underlying concerns that the election articulated: we must listen to them and we must respond â  Hammond  said  adding that the government should offer âpragmatic solutionsâ to improve ordinary peopleâs lives.
But with Brexit on the horizon  a slowing economy and the Bank of England hinting that interest rates could rise  May and  Hammond  have limited room for fiscal maneuver.
Labour said Hammondâs speech on Monday was disappointing.

input: WASHINGTON â  Anthony Scaramucci   President Trump's former communications director  is on a list of people blocked from entering the White House without special approval.
A day after saying he wasn't blocked  a White House official confirmed that  Scaramucci  is indeed among fired officials excluded from the campus. The acknowledgment came after the financier provided to Bloomberg News official White House correspondence that confirmed he was denied an appointment.
 Scaramucci  is among a group of former staffers who left ""under adverse circumstances"" placed on an ""administrative exclusion list "" the White House said in response to Bloomberg's questions. Those former employees must have any appointments on the premises ""evaluated on a case by case basis.""
 Scaramucci  provided emails indicating  he  had been denied access to the complex to counter a White House official's assertion Thursday that  his  claim of being blacklisted from the building was false. At the time  the official - who requested anonymity to discuss personnel matters - said  Scaramucci  was treated the same as any former staffer and would be granted access if  he  had legitimate  official business.
 Scaramucci  slams 'General Jackass' Kelly for blocking W.H. access
When an aide on Feb. 6 tried to get  Scaramucci  into the building  the Secret Service agent in charge of the appointment-scheduling system emailed that  Scaramucci  is ""administratively excluded from entering the complex at this time (not allowed access)."" The agent referred questions to White House Management and Administration staffer Monica Block.
Another message shows that when the aide asked Block about access for  Scaramucci   Block said only White House chief of staff John Kelly or deputy chief of staff Joe Hagin could override Scaramucci's exclusion.
The former communications adviser believes Kelly is blocking his access to the president.  Scaramucci  called for the chief of staff's resignation last month after disclosures that former staff secretary Rob Porter kept his job with access to top-secret information despite a background investigation that revealed allegations of domestic abuse by two of Porter's ex-wives.

The dispute over access to the White House comes as  Scaramucci  has renewed his offensive against Kelly following a chaotic week that included the resignation of Hope Hicks  a longtime Trump loyalist who now holds the communications director position.
""Does the president want to lose everyone because of General Jackass?""  Scaramucci  said Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg News  warning there would be ""a further evacuation of talent.""

Kelly on Friday defended  his  handling of the Porter scandal in a discussion with reporters  saying  he  had obtained a resignation from the former aide within hours of learning of the abuse allegations and tightened access to classified material at the White House. Kelly did acknowledge a ""disconnect"" at the White House in evaluating Porter's background check and a ""mix-up"" in issuing a public statement supportive of the former staff secretary despite the allegations.

input: In a letter posted on the White House web site Tuesday  John Brennan  assistant to President Barack Obama for homeland security and counterterrorism  said Schmidt will have regular access to the president and play a vital role in the country's security.
 Schmidt's selection comes more than 10 months after Obama declared cyber security a priority and ordered a broad administration review.
 A senior White House official said Obama was personally involved in the selection process and chose Schmidt because of his unique background and skills. Schmidt will have regular and direct access to the president for cyber security issues  the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the selection process.
 At the same time  cyber experts and potential job candidates have complained that the position lacks the budgetary and policy-making authority needed to be successful. Schmidt will report to the National Security Council and closely support the National Economic Council on cyber issues.
 Schmidt's selection suggests that economic and business interests in the White House held more sway in the selection process. Schmidt  president and CEO of the Information Security Forum  a nonprofit international consortium that conducts research in information security  has served as chief security officer for Microsoft and as cyber security chief for online auction giant eBay. He was reportedly preferred by Lawrence Summers  director of the economic council. A good format for the titel can be the simple subject + object + verb.

 ""Around 85 to 90 percent of our (environmental) concerns have been addressed. The process of building the Navi Mumbai airport can start today. With these compromises we are fully on board and will ensure speedy work "" Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh told the media here.
 The Navi Mumbai airport  which has been planned some 30 kilometers away from the current Chattrapati Shivaji airport in Mumbai  had been a contentious issue because of its environmental impact due to its location. But  the Indian Environment Ministry finally cleared the project.
 Claiming that the plans for the airport have been modified so that one river instead of two will be diverted  the minister said: ""River Gadhi would not be diverted to make way for the airport and added that 161 hectares of mangroves would fall under Navi Mumbai airport.""

input: From  Delegate-elect Lee Carter ; I hope to see statements like from every elected Virginia Democrat:
 Delegate-Elect Lee Carter  Urges Virginians  State Water Board to Reject Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley Pipeline Projects
“Dominion Resources and EQT have not compellingly demonstrated the need for the additional natural gas capacity in Virginia ” said  Carter . “And to make matters worse  that natural gas wouldn’t even be used for Virginian homes – the pipeline will run through the Commonwealth and be sent to Japan and India for export.”
 Carter  also has concerns that the project will massively increase Virginia’s carbon footprint  and destroy protected wilderness areas  as well as state and federal parks.
“Hardworking Virginians are going to end up paying for these unnecessary projects through higher power bill  in spite of the lack of economic benefit for Virginia  and if anything goes wrong with the pipeline  thousands of those Virginians will be in the ‘incineration zone’ – an area where all life would be incinerated if the pipeline explodes ” said  Carter .
 Carter  urges all to attend the Water is Life Rally in Richmond on December 2 from 1 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.
“Virginians need to fight back hard against these projects that are not only unnecessary – they’re dangerous ” said  Carter .
 He  also urges residents to attend the State Water Control Board’s meetings on December 6 and 7 and December 11 and 12 for the pipeline projects  and speak on their concerns about how these projects hurt our communities.
