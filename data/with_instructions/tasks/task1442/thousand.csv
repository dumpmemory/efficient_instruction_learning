input: CONTEXT: Spider-Man: Homecoming is following the Captain America: Civil War. I've seen the same trailer - and the clip with Spidey holding Cap's shield seems to be lifted straight from the CA:CW movie during the airport fight.

input: CONTEXT: The balance of power had shifted considerably since the first set of quotes. King Joffrey is dead, and his younger brother Tommen is now king. Unlike his wild card of an elder brother, Tommen is gentler and more prone to manipulation by his new bride. The Lannisters impeccable image has also been shattered. They failed to prevent the assassination of their king in the midst of his own wedding day, and the suspected assassin is the king's Lannister uncle. Not only do they look incompetent, they are divided among themselves. On the other hand, the Tyrells' situation is much stronger now. Tommen is already wrapped around Margaery's pretty little finger, and she knows that the assassination was orchestrated in part by her own family. In Margaery's eyes, the Lannisters look disoriented and lost. Putting on a show trial for one of their own, whom she knows is innocent of any wrongdoing. Whatever power Cersei held over Margaery has now been diminished.  <sep>  Q: What was Margaery's motivation to call Cersei 'sister' again?

input: CONTEXT: The plot by MI 6 and the CIA is to give Le Chiffre no choice but to turn himself in. They had no legal right to arrest him, lack of evidence and all. Once he lost the money, both organizations hoped the pressure by the real criminal contacts would force Chiffre to turn evidence over, instead of being killed. Both organizations are playing a long game in this. There was no expected immediate payout in the plan. If they arrest him, they would reveal their hand in the events and blow the operation. Additionally, Leiter was playing this by ear. The only reason the CIA could arrange this was because MI-6 decided it got too expensive and Bond was willing to work with them. It was a field decision that wasn't part of the actual CIA plan (Leiter was expected to win).  <sep>  Q: Why didn't Felix Leiter catch Le Chiffre after the game was done?

input: CONTEXT: In the books it is yet to be discovered if he is brought back to life for what greater purpose. But one thing is for sure, it isn't just one thing he did, but many. Probably in the books he is the one who kills the Night King, because it was clear from David Benioff's interview that they wanted to subvert expectations, they wanted someone who was not Jon to kill the Night King. So I think in the books he came back to life for also killing the NK. He was brought back to do a lot of things if you start to see it that way, a chain of events that led to a lot of things. Defeated Ramsay, showed the World that the dead are coming, prepared for the Long Night and battle of Winterfell. Successfully defeating NK would not have been possible without him. What the Lord of Light could have wanted? Well, we don't even know what LoL was, didn't know what his intentions were, who were his enemy but one thing we know for sure, all victories inevitably came at a cost.

input: CONTEXT: A Song of Ice and Fire really sounds quite fantasy-ish, whereas Game of Thrones sounds medieval and more suitable for a show. Also, the name 'Game of Thrones' gives more information about what will happen in the TV series (politics and fight for the throne) than the name A song of ice and fire does.

A Song of Ice and Fire is sophisticated and poetic, but Game of Thrones is direct and exciting and very easily remembered. And that's what counts for the average person. Note also that the phrase is used in the other books and is perhaps even better than the series title at describing in one phrase the whole point of the books.  <sep>  Q: Why is the TV show titled ""Game of Thrones"" and not ""A Song of Ice and Fire?"" A: A Song of Ice and Fire really sounds quite fantasy-ish, whereas Game of Thrones sounds medieval and more suitable for a show  Q: True, but the book series is called ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" don't you think that would attract more people who were fans of the book?

Quite a few Native American tribes used this kind of fishing technique to catch freshwater fish.

input: CONTEXT: I think it's deliberately ambiguous. If it's real, the inconsistencies are easily explained by Vidal's fascist belief system. These elements simply are not part of his world. If it's fantasy, then of course only Ofelia can see these thing because she imagined them. I think part of Del Toro's purpose in the film was to maintain the plausibility of both of these interpretations. <sep> Q: Is Ofelia just dreaming things to get herself in a fairy world? A: If it's fantasy, then of course only Ofelia can see these thing because she imagined them  Q: Are the things happening for real but visible only to Ofelia?

input: CONTEXT: Spider-Man: Homecoming is following the Captain America: Civil War. I've seen the same trailer - and the clip with Spidey holding Cap's shield seems to be lifted straight from the CA:CW movie during the airport fight.

input: CONTEXT: As we see in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (during the climactic fight between Darth Maul, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi) and Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (when dozens of Jedi storm the arena where Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala have been sentenced to death), Jedi have no qualms about killing those that are trying to kill them. In fact, we see that Obi-Wan Kenobi is referred to as General Kenobi in Star Wars films set after the events of the Clone Wars, so we can be reasonably sure that there is nothing prohibiting Jedi killing people in battle. However, at the point you are asking about in Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, Count Dooku is an unarmed opponent and poses little to no further threat. The Jedi way would have been to arrest him, not murder him, as Anakin himself correctly says in the quote in the question.  <sep>  Q: In Star Wars, can a Jedi kill? A: Jedi have no qualms about killing those that are trying to kill them  Q: Is it a plot device? A: Obi-Wan Kenobi is referred to as General Kenobi in Star Wars films set after the events of the Clone Wars, so we can be reasonably sure that there is nothing prohibiting Jedi killing people in battle  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Who is killed in the first movie?

input: CONTEXT: I'm afraid you completely misunderstood a lot of the movie. At the start of the movie, Hal is already dead (killed himself in prison). Those scenes with Hal (mostly in New York) were all flashbacks. The present is with sister in San Francisco. Jasmine meets Dwight at a party in San Francisco. This is long after Hal killed himself. But to your question: ""Why did Jasmine arrest Hal?"" It was purely a spur of the moment, revenge thing. Hal had just told Jasmine that he was in love with this French girl and was going to leave her. And almost immediately, Jasmine calls the FBI (or rather calls someone to get the FBI's number).  <sep>  Q: Why did Jasmine arrest Hal?

input: CONTEXT: Maybe it's because with origami you can go from a simple non living material such as a simple sheet of paper and mold it into something that is a representation of a living thing. Although this might never get a true answer I like to think it has something to do with the artificial creation of something representing life or dreams. When thinking further along these lines it strikes me that indeed the origami are all artificial representations of something living, yet a unicorn can never be really alive which can then be some sort of an origami analogy for Deckard = Replicant.  <sep>  Q: What does the origami represent in Blade Runner?

Francesca knows how people, especially women are treated in that town if adultery is whispered about. The film shows how Lucy Delaney is treated by the people in town over gossip about her committing adultery with a married man. Francesca's husband is well respected in that town. She loves her husband and children too much to ruin them in that town with gossip. That's why she acts as if she doesn't really know or care about Robert.  <sep>  Q: Is she lying on the phone?

input: CONTEXT: There was no movie rating system in place back in the 1940's, and movies were greatly censored by the US government. In the 1920's the Supreme Court ruled that free speech did not apply to movies, and a control board was arranged where by all film studios had to submit their scripts for censorship. Movie studios were given guide lines by which they had to follow. So it's not so much that profanity is now widespread, as much as it was strictly forbidden back in the 1940's. This system of governed film making slowly started to collapse over the years and gave birth to the Motion Picture film rating system. Where the film ratings and censorship is controlled by the film industry and not by a single controlling person or government. Now that we have the rating system, films can be classified by their rating. Today's ratings are, at least by idea, implemented by our peers. So as society changes so do those who review and rate films. That is why we see more profanity in PG rated films, as parents who rate the films accept the fact that children in this age group use these profane words or acknowledge that the film works the way the script was written. New ratings were introduced including PG-13. To address the need for films that target a segment of the population that are pre-adult but seek adult style films. Still, I have to wonder who these people are that rate these films.  <sep>  Q: Era of profanity in movie scripts?

input: CONTEXT: He wants to destroy the symbol of the revolution. Think back to the end of the first film. Katniss saves Peeta's life by threatening to eat the poisonous berries, and thus kill them both. In doing so she forces the government's hand, making Snow look weak. Katniss then has to pretend to love Peeta, and this love is shown to the public. Snow even taunts her with it, knowing the love is false. But he doesn't reveal it publicly, because he knows he can use it against her. Katniss then becomes the face of the revolution. By showing Peeta switching sides, and by having him be the one to kill Katniss, Snow will regain his lost power. He will once again appear to be the man in charge. Part of this comes from the Quarter Quell, where Katniss (to the public at least) apparently abandons Peeta. It's also a massive personal and demoralising blow against Katniss. Even if Peeta fails, Snow hopes to break Katniss' spirit, and in doing so destroy her, and the revolution with it. He fails, because he doesn't count on Katniss actually coming to love Peeta.  <sep>  Q: Which rescue team saves them?

input: CONTEXT: He wants to destroy the symbol of the revolution. Think back to the end of the first film. Katniss saves Peeta's life by threatening to eat the poisonous berries, and thus kill them both. In doing so she forces the government's hand, making Snow look weak. Katniss then has to pretend to love Peeta, and this love is shown to the public. Snow even taunts her with it, knowing the love is false. But he doesn't reveal it publicly, because he knows he can use it against her. Katniss then becomes the face of the revolution. By showing Peeta switching sides, and by having him be the one to kill Katniss, Snow will regain his lost power. He will once again appear to be the man in charge. Part of this comes from the Quarter Quell, where Katniss (to the public at least) apparently abandons Peeta. It's also a massive personal and demoralising blow against Katniss. Even if Peeta fails, Snow hopes to break Katniss' spirit, and in doing so destroy her, and the revolution with it. He fails, because he doesn't count on Katniss actually coming to love Peeta.  <sep>  Q: Which rescue team saves them?

input: CONTEXT: Mike has not spent a dime of Fring's drug money, which is revealed when he is first interrogated by the DEA.

Technically this might be a conflict of interest, but these are not moral, law-abiding citizens. Additionally, working for Goodman allows Mike to keep an eye on Walt and Jesse, who are very much part of Fring's interests. This would explain why Gus would allow Mike to work for Goodman.

input: CONTEXT: For a perfect clone, down to the quantum level, both would be the real Angier. That is the essence of his fear. The real Angier will be killed every time. When you download a movie what you are doing is actually making a perfect copy of the movie. Which is the real movie? They all are. This is very different from making copies of film reels where only the original have the quality of the original (each copy adds a little imperfection). Now, the question The Prestige asks is what if you can make a perfect clone of a person the way you can perfectly copy digital data? In one sense, if we don't want to get too uncomfortable we can always say the remaining copy is now the real data and the deleted copy is not real anymore. But if you really think about it and get out of your comfort zone you will realize that both people are real and what you have done is murdered yourself. In The Prestige this point is much more clearly made as the old copied Angier becomes the one who is killed. Not the newly created clone. Every time the clone will have only the memory of the surviving Angier. But every time Angier experiences death, only the Angier that experienced death has no way of passing that memory to the surviving Angier so the survivor can never know what dying feels like.  <sep>  Q: How does it work that the clones are sentient paradox?

input: CONTEXT: The film depends heavily on the events of X-Men 3: The Last Stand. In that film, Wolverine does something he regrets heavily, and it is the basis for his character arc in The Wolverine. So to fully appreciate this film, you should watch X-Men 3. But to fully appreciate X-Men 3, you should see X-Men and X-Men 2, since it's a sequel to those, and a continuation of those stories. You can skip X-Men: First Class, as it has no bearing on The Wolverine. And you should skip X-Men Origins: Wolverine for the many reasons critics described back when it was released (it also doesn't have much bearing on The Wolverine). Alternatively, if you're familiar with the X-Men from the comics, and are aware of some of the key storylines that occurred there, you can read this spoiler to get up to speed: In X-Men 3, Jean Grey is taken over by the Phoenix. She goes on a rampage, allies with Magneto and begins a mutant vs. human war. Wolverine is forced to kill her because she's completely out of control.  <sep>  Q: Can The Wolverine be viewed as a stand-alone film? A: to fully appreciate X-Men 3, you should see X-Men and X-Men 2, since it's a sequel to those, and a continuation of those stories  Q: Will I miss anything if I skip the first movie?

The reason Barry is returned so soon is that his abduction corresponds close in time with that final interaction.

input: CONTEXT: I think it was worded that way for pragmatic reasons. Peter Jackson didn't want to tell the story of Sméagol until after the character Gollum was established. In The Fellowship of the Ring, the viewer is intended to see Gollum as a sort of beast. In The Two Towers, he has a much larger role and seems sort of halfway between beast and person, but a viewer who has not read the books is still unlikely to guess that he is a corrupted hobbit. The Return of the King opens with the story of Sméagol and Déagol to shed new light on who Gollum is, where he came from, why the Ring means so much to him, and what kind of influence the Ring wields over him. It is a bit of a shocking scene; the shock would not be nearly as strong if the viewer already knew Gollum's origin. So, in the opening of The Fellowship of the Ring, that Gollum was once a hobbit named Sméagol is an extraneous detail. While ""the Ring came to Gollum"" is an oversimplification, it was a necessary one; it told the viewer what he needed to know at that point in the story and no more.  <sep>  Q: Why does the narrator say 'The ring came to the creature Gollum'?

Toby's role as a HR employee would primarily be protecting Dunder Mifflin from Michael's stupidity. Michael Scott is, by design, an absolute idiot of a character. He's totally incompetent as a manager and also has absolutely no understanding of what is and isn't appropriate for the workplace, especially when occupying a managerial position. Toby would be the one who calls him up on his inappropriate conduct, reports that conduct back to corporate, and who would be responsible for telling Michael ""no"" before he does things that he shouldn't. Children will occasionally tell their parents that they hate them (or at least don't love them) when they've been denied something they want or have been told off for doing something they shouldn't. Michael's essentially having a childish - and ongoing - reaction against the authority figure who denies him the things he wants.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: It seems to be mostly due to the convenience of the channel or network airing a series with a number of pre-recorded episodes or at least a batch of them. For example, when a network buys or syndicates a series that has, let's say, 10 episodes and start airing the episodes in december, if they air episodes 1 and 2 but the christmas episode of the series is the number 10, they will air the 10th episode as the 3rd one to coincide wih the holidays. Other scenario is when something happens in the real world and the series has an episode that deals with a similar theme. Take as an example the shootings that happened in France recently. Some networks will alter the airing order of episodes in a series to avoid a similar subject to avoid the sensationalism, other may try to cash on it and air sooner an episode that dealed with something similar. Also, a network can try to get people into watching their series and getting high ratings, airing the ""best"" episodes of a series first (i.e. the ones with the more action, or drama, or sex, etc.). Then, when the series go to DVD the numbering order is usually the scripted order and not the airing one, that's why both differ.  <sep>  Q: What is the reason that the air order and the DVD order of a tv show is different?

input: CONTEXT: It seems to be mostly due to the convenience of the channel or network airing a series with a number of pre-recorded episodes or at least a batch of them. For example, when a network buys or syndicates a series that has, let's say, 10 episodes and start airing the episodes in december, if they air episodes 1 and 2 but the christmas episode of the series is the number 10, they will air the 10th episode as the 3rd one to coincide wih the holidays. Other scenario is when something happens in the real world and the series has an episode that deals with a similar theme. Take as an example the shootings that happened in France recently. Some networks will alter the airing order of episodes in a series to avoid a similar subject to avoid the sensationalism, other may try to cash on it and air sooner an episode that dealed with something similar. Also, a network can try to get people into watching their series and getting high ratings, airing the ""best"" episodes of a series first (i.e. the ones with the more action, or drama, or sex, etc.). Then, when the series go to DVD the numbering order is usually the scripted order and not the airing one, that's why both differ.  <sep>  Q: What is the reason that the air order and the DVD order of a tv show is different?

There's a very famous one whose name escapes me at the moment which deals with live concert footage, they were the first ones known to have the Rush show from Capital Theater in 1976 (which has since been officially released by Rush) as well as a Boston concert from 1979, among a large selection of others.  <sep>  Q: was waiting for godet released on film? A: this was never released on film  Q: Is there footage available anywhere?

input: CONTEXT: Travellers is about saving people in the future not in the present by altering the course of history. The people from the future can only do this safely and without unpredictable side-effects on the timeline if they don't ""save"" lives in the past. Their future technology actually does allow them to replace people who were not about to die, but they regard this as a moral problem and it is forbidden. But they can take over those lives if they were about to be eliminated from the timeline, hence the apparent paradox of ""saving"" McClaren. But they haven't actually saved McClaren at all, they have replaced him with a traveller. Early in the series only people about to die get replaced. Obviously the whole point is to alter the timeline but the travellers are aiming not for minor alterations like saving a single, random life, but for big alterations that radically change the course of history. One of their protocols actually forbids them from saving other lives as well even when they know someone is about to die (but not be replaced). This [minor spoiler alert] becomes a source of some dramatic tension in later episodes.  <sep>  Q: Why does MacLaren die in the first episode of Travelers?

input: CONTEXT: The source material is essentially a recollection of a life lived by an individual on his death bed. We are seeing these things through the lens of memory, so it is meant to be an almost first person account. There are other moments in the film where things move around for no apparent reason and the stage itself does not move in accordance with objective reality. That particular scene is from ""Swann In Love"" by Proust and it was an attempt at capturing visually some measure of Swann's emotive memory of a musical experience from that story. I won't comment on whether it was successful. The closest thing I can think at this moment that has this sort of movement might be in Wes Anderson movies where suddenly the naturalistic feel is broken in favor of a staged play: the Zissou movie and ""Moonrise Kingdom"" both take similar but more obvious breaks from naturalism.  <sep>  Q: Why is the audience sliding around in this scene from Le Temps retrouvé?

input: CONTEXT: First of all, spoiler-alert! Yes, the movie begins with a slowly zooming shot of the blind antagonist dragging an unconscious Rocky back towards his house, however, there is no trail of blood, just cracks in the dilapidated road and she does not appear to be as injured as you believe. I would provide you with relevant screenshots if I could, but the movie is not yet available for private ownership. This moment in the movie must have happened after he knocks her unconscious when she exits the car where she has trapped his dog. There is no reason to believe that she is bleeding profusely.  <sep>  Q: How does the climax make sense? A: I would provide you with relevant screenshots if I could, but the movie is not yet available for private ownership  Q: From the beginning scene, it seems that Rocky was fatally hurt, so how was it possible for her to leave with her daughter so soon after the incident? A: This moment in the movie must have happened after he knocks her unconscious when she exits the car where she has trapped his dog  Q: Was she hurt when he knocks her unconscious? A: There is no reason to believe that she is bleeding profusely  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: IT seems that Rocky was fatally hurt, so how was it possible for her to leave with her daughter without medical assistance?

input: CONTEXT: Solozzo indeed puts in place many countermeasures. First and most important, he was with Police Captain Mark McCluskey, who was on his payroll. Those days no one dared to do anything to a policeman, especially a Captain. It means bringing wrath of force and media on the whole family. Second, Micheal was checked for arms/guns or weapons while in the car sent by Solozzo. So, he was not supposed to have gun. The only man with a gun was the Captain, who was on Solozzo's side. Thirdly, Micheal was not even supposed to know where they were meeting until the end. Solozzo was confident that he could not plant a weapon or a man at the meeting place. The Corleone family got this information by paying some man from the Solozzo gang. Fourth, Micheal did not seem that harmful, as he recently joined family that to be until Don was in hospital. In fact, he was not involved in family business that time. All the above conclude that the only man who was at risk was Micheal. The countermeasures taken by Micheal for having a place with people, it works both ways. Micheal was also not supposed to be able to kill in front of people.  <sep>  Q: Why did Sollozzo risk it? A: the only man who was at risk was Micheal  Q: So why didn't Sollozzo put any counter measures for such a ""Just in-case"" scenario?

input: CONTEXT: I think it's deliberately ambiguous. If it's real, the inconsistencies are easily explained by Vidal's fascist belief system. These elements simply are not part of his world. If it's fantasy, then of course only Ofelia can see these thing because she imagined them.

A: If it's fantasy, then of course only Ofelia can see these thing because she imagined them  Q: Are the things happening for real but visible only to Ofelia?

input: CONTEXT: Spider-Man: Homecoming is following the Captain America: Civil War. I've seen the same trailer - and the clip with Spidey holding Cap's shield seems to be lifted straight from the CA:CW movie during the airport fight. Later in the trailer (or in another trailer), Peter is boasting to his friend about meeting Iron Man and the Avengers, and how he stole Captain America's shield from him.  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: When did Spider-Man steal Captain America's shield?

input: CONTEXT: Tom Dougherty: He was a douchebag and doesn't seems to have many friends in the department. Miss Kringle found the note about him leaving Gotham which Nygma forged. Gotham is a city where crime is at its peak, and a police officer running away like that doesn't seem surprising. Kristen Kringle: Nygma was trustworthy until then and was dating Kringle, so when he told Leslie Thompkins that Kringle had reconciled her relationship with Dougherty and left Gotham, she trusted him. People just trusted what Nygma told them, because they thought he was trustworthy. And we don't know about their families; they might have had no-one of their own, it's possible in a city where people die so frequently. Plus, they work in a police station which is always too busy to care about them.  <sep>  Q: Why doesn't anyone care about the whereabouts of Miss Kringle and Tom Dougherty?

input: CONTEXT: The comic states that the Radioactive spider was created by experimenting on Peter Parker's blood (by Oscorp). However, there is no mention of this in the movie whatsoever. There are two possibilities: 1) That the spider in the film was also part of some lab experiments based on the blood of Peter Parker of that universe (the one who dies). 2) That the spider came from another universe. The question then is ""how did the spider get to the universe before the portal was opened?"". The answer to that would be ""The spider came from another universe and traveled back in time just like Gwen did"". However, to keep things simple, we can assume that Oscorp was up to no good and were experimenting with Peter's blood and Miles got bit by it.

She is sort of alone having only Abigail left who the Queen is somewhat realizing is frivolous and cruel. She had banished Sarah (Rachel Weisz's character) whom she clearly felt a bond with so her mood is further dampened cause of that.

input: CONTEXT: There were many contradictions in Prot's character -- on one hand, he had an astonishing knowledge of astronomy (some of the things he'd discovered were absolutely new to some famous astronomers); on the other hand, he was hospitalized in a mental institute due to the fact that he had many mental issues. The staff obviously concluded that they were dealing with a mentally insane genius. He was maybe quite a unique and non-standard patient, but regardless - he was a patient in a mental hospital. Some people took this pretty seriously, and investigated his story, but you must remember that the entire situation ended pretty quickly -- throughout the entire film, they had very little time. Prot had a ""deadline"" -- if it was a countdown to a return to his home-planet or to a complete mental breakdown, either way it was a real deadline.  <sep>  Q: What can you tell me about the K-Pax Alien?

input: CONTEXT: While Frollo's function was indeed divided between several characters, Disney also deviates and simplifies the material to make it compatible with a younger audience. Hence, characters have alternate back stories that present different motivations and the nuances of the source material may be forgone, rendering certain details like Quasimodo's lineage inconsequential. As such, while it is intriguing to consider possibilities, there is no hint, aside from disreprencies with portrayals, that the gypsi woman was not Quasimodo's true mother. Honestly, this is similar to the puzzle as to why characters see a similarity between Malcolm and his daughter in The Lost World.  <sep>  Q: In Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame: Is the gyspy woman really Quasimodo's mom?

input: CONTEXT: While Frollo's function was indeed divided between several characters, Disney also deviates and simplifies the material to make it compatible with a younger audience. Hence, characters have alternate back stories that present different motivations and the nuances of the source material may be forgone, rendering certain details like Quasimodo's lineage inconsequential. As such, while it is intriguing to consider possibilities, there is no hint, aside from disreprencies with portrayals, that the gypsi woman was not Quasimodo's true mother. Honestly, this is similar to the puzzle as to why characters see a similarity between Malcolm and his daughter in The Lost World.  <sep>  Q: In Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame: Is the gyspy woman really Quasimodo's mom? A: while it is intriguing to consider possibilities, there is no hint, aside from disreprencies with portrayals, that the gypsi woman was not Quasimodo's true mother  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Why do you think Disney added the Gypsy woman to the story when she was not in the book?

input: CONTEXT: I do not have an authoritative answer, but my impression is this: Budd is not particularly enthused about the entire conversation with Bill or where Bill wants it to go, be it because of his animosity towards Bill, his battle weariness, surrendering his fate to Beatrix, or a combination of these motivations – which are all supported by the rest of the dialogue. Saying that he pawned his Hanzo sword seems like the easiest option to end the conversation and indeed it ends shortly afterwards. Had Budd said that he still had the sword, this would have given Bill leverage to make (or try to make) Budd join his cause. Had Budd said that he sold the sword for an appropriate price, this would obviously contradict Budd's apparent financial situation.  <sep>  Q: Why did Budd lie about him having his sword? A: I do not have an authoritative answer, but my impression is this: Budd is not particularly enthused about the entire conversation with Bill  Q: Why is Budd unhappy with Bill? A: because of his animosity towards Bill  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Does Beatrix get revenge?

input: CONTEXT: By the time of Infinity War, they could not have kept the Infinity Stones in Odin's Vault, because of the events in Ragnarok, which, by the end of the movie, left Odin dead and Asgard destroyed. The Asgardians wouldn't have kept the Infinity Stones in the Vault before Ragnarok either, because they knew that a cataclysmic event was coming, even if they didn't know when, so it would logically be safer to keep the stones away from Asgard. Finally, just as logical assumption, if you have a super-destructive device in six parts, it would make more sense to keep those parts as far away from each other as possible so that it would be more difficult for said weapon to fall in to the wrong hands. If they're all in one place, no matter how secure, that only makes it easier to collect all the parts.

input: CONTEXT: It is a common fact on TV that combat and injuries are stylized to make it look good rather than realistic. Have a look at pretty much any film fight where someone knows a martial art and compare that to someone who knows a martial art fighting for real. They are worlds apart. Even if you look at American Wrestling and BJJ you can see the difference. Knocking someone out with one punch is extremely difficult, especially if they are used to combat. I have taken an unpulled hit from a quarter staff on the top of my head which caused me to blackout later but I still didn't go down at the time. After almost 20 years of martial arts and living in rough areas I have only been knocked unconscious with one punch once, when I was 17 by the European Kickboxing champion. I was punched to the ground by a bouncer in Portsmouth when I was 20 but was still conscious until he stamped on my head. Most of the people in the Walking Dead would have starved or succumb to injuries by now if they were suffering this scenario for real. Not to mention being struck down by illness.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I thought the film's use of the theme was much more politicized than the book's. In the book, when Kenny says that he and George are invisible, I wasn't quite sure what he meant. In the movie, invisibility has been threaded throughout much more explicitly: in the classroom scene George clearly describes “invisible minorities” to his class. I took this as the filmmaker's attempt to make the historical particularities of George's situation clear. In the book, however, Kenny's comment sort of complicates George's understanding of his own minority position. Throughout the book, George believes his pain is invisible to others because society has refused to acknowledge his relationship. He thinks this is a somewhat unique situation, because of his position as a gay man in a homophobic society. Kenny's comment, however, suggests that invisibility is more inclusive than that. Perhaps Kenny means that they're invisible because they're out when no one expects them to be out, or because their homosocial behavior isn't understood by society, or because they're powerless to stop the Cuban Missile Crisis. Or, perhaps Kenny knows that George is gay and is trying to have an experience by sharing the evening with him. I don't know and I don't think we're supposed to know. One of the fantastic things about this novel for me is the way it explodes the idea that we grow closer to others by understanding them better. Caring, closeness, and love in the novel aren't degraded by failures of understanding.  <sep>  Q: What is the meaning of Kenny's words in this scene?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: NOTE: OBSA (One Big Spoiler Alert) His character relied on common sense of all seamen, as he saw it. There are several instances throughout the movie where his character makes statements to his crew as to why he's doing things the way he is, which, while unpopular at the outset, made sense and was bought into after the explanation. He used this same common sense seamanship to bring the conclusion which happened. With the ending, he took a gamble, relying on his instincts as a veteran of the seas. He didn't know the Russian ship was going to fire on the base, but was hoping for some kind of resolution which didn't require his boat to fire. While he was given the order to fire from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Donnegan, he knew it would create bigger issues and further hostilities. Having the Russian Captain Andropov onboard and believing in him was a good step towards making this happen. Without Andropov, it probably wouldn't have turned out the same way. He trusted the Captain to help him and hoped the Captain trusted him in the same way. Andropov's intervention with the crew of the Russian vessel allowed him the best course of action. It wasn't that he forced someone else to fire, he only hoped it would happen without his having to do it. In the end, everything worked out for the best (ex machina?).  <sep>  Q: How did Gerard Butler resolve the ending of Hunter Killer?

There are several instances throughout the movie where his character makes statements to his crew as to why he's doing things the way he is, which, while unpopular at the outset, made sense and was bought into after the explanation. He used this same common sense seamanship to bring the conclusion which happened. With the ending, he took a gamble, relying on his instincts as a veteran of the seas. He didn't know the Russian ship was going to fire on the base, but was hoping for some kind of resolution which didn't require his boat to fire. While he was given the order to fire from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Donnegan, he knew it would create bigger issues and further hostilities. Having the Russian Captain Andropov onboard and believing in him was a good step towards making this happen. Without Andropov, it probably wouldn't have turned out the same way. He trusted the Captain to help him and hoped the Captain trusted him in the same way. Andropov's intervention with the crew of the Russian vessel allowed him the best course of action.

input: CONTEXT: After some searching around finally found it: Polonaise in A-flat major, Op. 53, by Chopin, known as ""Heroic"" The piece is famous for being extremely difficult and is often included in standard repetoires of professional pianists to demonstrate their skill.

input: CONTEXT: It is not clear anywhere in movie to what religion she belonged. She was shown as orphan, it may be possilbe she never knew what religion her parents belonged to. As far as her name Latika is concerned, it is used by both muslims and hindus. It seems the director didn't want to show her as associated with any religion. If you look at her life, most of the time she was in kind of house arrest, so she herself may not have had time to decide what religion she wants.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I am surprised no one has suggested a bullet proof vest as the explanation. The first shot, hitting Bond in the shoulder, is above the location of any kevlar plates. This shot leaves an entry wound and shrapnel. The second shot, that knocks Bond off the train, makes impact around his ribs on his right side. If Bond did have a bullet proof vest on, this area is likely to be covered. The impact from the bullet is transferred through the kevlar plate/s onto a larger area of Bonds body. Rather than penetrating his ribcage, and leaving an entry wound, the vest stops the bullet. Stopping the bullet before it enters his body imparts a lot more force onto Bond, which explains him being thrown off the train. It also explains the 4 broken ribs and minor organ damage. Bullet wounds are typically puncture wounds, deep and localised. Without a vest, Bond would have suffered much more serious organ damage as the bullet tears through him. Bullet proof vests typically leave blunt trauma injuries, affecting larger areas, and are not likely to leave scarring. One direct bullet wound is not likely to break 3 ribs, however the impact through a kevlar plate definitely is.  <sep>  Q: in Skyfall opening scene on train, does Bond fake getting shot?

Bullet wounds are typically puncture wounds, deep and localised. Without a vest, Bond would have suffered much more serious organ damage as the bullet tears through him. Bullet proof vests typically leave blunt trauma injuries, affecting larger areas, and are not likely to leave scarring. One direct bullet wound is not likely to break 3 ribs, however the impact through a kevlar plate definitely is.  <sep>  Q: in Skyfall opening scene on train, does Bond fake getting shot? A: I am surprised no one has suggested a bullet proof vest as the explanation. The first shot, hitting Bond in the shoulder, is above the location of any kevlar plates  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Where was he injured?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I am surprised no one has suggested a bullet proof vest as the explanation. The first shot, hitting Bond in the shoulder, is above the location of any kevlar plates. This shot leaves an entry wound and shrapnel. The second shot, that knocks Bond off the train, makes impact around his ribs on his right side. If Bond did have a bullet proof vest on, this area is likely to be covered. The impact from the bullet is transferred through the kevlar plate/s onto a larger area of Bonds body. Rather than penetrating his ribcage, and leaving an entry wound, the vest stops the bullet. Stopping the bullet before it enters his body imparts a lot more force onto Bond, which explains him being thrown off the train. It also explains the 4 broken ribs and minor organ damage.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: This is not really explicitly explained in the film (it's only briefly mentioned), but implicitly: Anton Ego is a famous critic known for scathing reviews and an extremely finicky taste. When Linguini holds a press conference, Ego arrives and announces in front of the reporters that he'll be reviewing Linguini's restaurant - so this review is highly publicized and anticipated. Then, surprisingly, not only is his review not scathing, but he also calls the restaurant's chef the finest chef in France. And soon after the review is published, it turns out that the kitchen was infested with rats.

input: CONTEXT: It's in Parry's mind. At the start of the scene, people in Grand Central Station are just walking, making noise, chaotic. Parry is looking for Lydia, whom he is in love with. When Parry sees Lydia, classical music starts, and the chaotic crowd is now in sync (in Parry's mind). They begin waltzing around him. Parry has a smile on his face. He follows Lydia through the sweetly dancing couples, all the way across Grand Central Station, and the universe is in harmony, for him. When he finally loses sight of Lydia on the other side, the couples go back to being a crowd, and the music stops and is replaced with the dissonant noises of the throng. Here is the scene: EDIT I also found an interview with director Terry Gilliam (below) regarding that particular scene. In the video, at 2:10, he says, ""I just love the idea of Perry being so in love that, you know, the world changes to whatever dreams he has.""  <sep>  Q: Why people were dancing at the subway?

input: CONTEXT: I think it comes down to one point - can one mind actively dream two or more states simultaneously. For the dream within a dream thing to work .... the dreamer in level 1 (Yusuf) has to dream the Pasiv (sleep) machine into existence, in order to allow people to go down to the next level (the hotel dream of Arthur). For someone to simultaneously be maintaining level 1 and be able to go to 'sleep' and maintain level 2 seems unlikely - you'd essentially have to be 'awake' in each dream state. So it appears for the dream within a dream thing to work, you need as many people to dream as levels you wish to descend.

input: CONTEXT: There's a longer version of this scene in the Season 4 trailer, which was cut down for the episode, that makes things more clear. Ramsay is a sadomasochist; he enjoys giving and receiving pain, especially during sex. In the extended version, Myranda not only chokes Ramsay, but also slaps him around a bit. He's enjoying it. The fact that we don't see Myranda after that, I suspect, is simply to the fact that we haven't had any reason to see her. She is on the cast list to appear in Season 5, so she's almost certainly not dead.  <sep>  Q: Did Myranda try to kill Ramsay?

This new tracker having been put in place by the IMF and not the Parisian authorities that were holding Lane and trying to get him back from Hunt's team making not only Lane but Walker not realizing that Lane was still being tracked. I also believe they did this in order to set Lane's tracker as visible again and when they set the drone away with Lane's tracker to keep the authorities on a goose chase thinking that Lane was still on the move while Hunt's team escaped with Lane. When they finally set the drone free you can hear helicopters passing by overhead. They drew the authorities closer to the tracker and then set it free instead of them trying to follow them to the sewers.  <sep>  Q: Why did Hunt's team set a 90 seconds limit to take out the tracker from Lane's neck?

Stark coped with his condition by turning it into the Iron Man, and helping others. Banner still feared what ""the other guy"" would do when unleashed. This was then reinforced after he is induced into becoming the Hulk on the Helicarrier. Upon awaking in the abandoned warehouse and learning the Hulk aimed for it to prevent casualties, Banner came to realize that the Hulk isn't always a danger to others. Thusly he chose to join the other heroes in New York City to defend Earth, whereas earlier in the film he had made it abundantly clear that his only role was to identify the location of the Tesseract.  <sep>  Q: Why does Banner finally allow the Hulk to come out?

input: CONTEXT: Largely he gains his confidence from Tony Stark. Their working together and sharing their personal issues caused Banner to rethink the way he thought of ""the other guy"". Stark coped with his condition by turning it into the Iron Man, and helping others. Banner still feared what ""the other guy"" would do when unleashed. This was then reinforced after he is induced into becoming the Hulk on the Helicarrier. Upon awaking in the abandoned warehouse and learning the Hulk aimed for it to prevent casualties, Banner came to realize that the Hulk isn't always a danger to others. Thusly he chose to join the other heroes in New York City to defend Earth, whereas earlier in the film he had made it abundantly clear that his only role was to identify the location of the Tesseract.  <sep>  Q: Why does Banner finally allow the Hulk to come out? A: Banner came to realize that the Hulk isn't always a danger to others  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Where does he get the confident he needs to be sure he can point the beast towards the enemy, and not towards the Avengers?

input: CONTEXT: I haven't seen the show in a while and don't have any references handy but as i recall Louis wasn't as cool and liked by others like Harvey was. Louis was always recognized as good at his job but he was never part of the in crowd, and failed at the interoffice politics necessary to rise as quickly and be as prominent as Harvey. So Louis's personality made it hard for him to have the professional successes that Harvey enjoyed but that same personality made it easy for him to be a good financial steward. Harvey on the other hand was careless with the money he earned but his charisma allowed him to do better in the office politics of the firm leading to more professional success but a worse financial position than Louis. Overall depending on how you define winner or best either one of them could be worthy of those titles. You seem to view their balance sheet as the arbitrator of success, and not professional achievement in the form of being managing partner. In all reality Louis had enough money to maintain his lifestyle if he quit getting a paycheck, unlike Harvey. However, as portrayed in the show becoming managing partner and mastering the relevant politics to become the de facto leader was the holy grail. Harvey was always closer than Louis in attaining this goal, making Harvey the better man in terms of the show like it or not.  <sep>  Q: Why does Louis Litt struggle with self-esteem issues, given that he is the richest in the law firm despite getting a lower salary?

input: CONTEXT: I have not seen the movie so I have not seen the tools themselves. However operations which require cutting bone often require tools which might at first glance look like conventional power tools, such as drills. Tools designed for operations are designed to be very controllable in terms of speeds and the cutting implements themselves are made of high quality materials to prevent contamination, and can be autoclaved to be sterilized (using high pressure and temperature) but essentially they are not that far removed from hardware tools. In terms of being awake during surgery. The main reason to anaesthetise a patient in an operation is to prevent the pain and stop any movement which would disturb the operation. The scalp itself has pain receptors but the brain has none, once the work has progressed into the brain itself no pain from that part would be felt, but with a local topical anaesthetic the scalp might not be too painful. One could imagine that you could be awake but not be in much discomfort in a brain operation.  <sep>  Q: Is the brain sequence similar to reality or not?

A: aking off noses makes them distinctly non-mammalian, and makes the world monstrous instead of just populated with animals  Q: Why did Sully have a nose then? A: Sully, however, has to walk the line between a teddy bear and a blue Sasquatch so that Boo can both be terrified of him and grow to love him  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Is there anything else about Sully I should know?

input: CONTEXT: Let us assume that the love that Persephone once enjoyed was with Merovingian. Merovingian and Persephone have slightly more human traits than other programs, they enjoy fine food, wine, languages. While Persephone talks of love, Merovingian displays lust (""The lipstick that is not on Merovingian's face""). Merovingian is shown to cheat on Persephone. Surprisingly, he uses a special code to trigger sexual reactions in a woman and gets serviced by her! Persephone's envy leads her to give Neo and gang the Key Maker's location. The Oracle mentions Merovingian to be the oldest of them, a powerful program. No program other than the Oracle has the purpose to be human like. The fact that Merovingian and Persephone turn human-like is them exhibiting programmatic roguishness. Their initial purpose is not mentioned, but the period of love that Persephone mentions is when they went rogue. Merovingian controls the virtual afterlife through the train-man program. This is where exiled programs seek refuge. Though this is the current operation, perhaps in the beginning, Merovingian was created with the purpose of Programmatic Garbage Collection. Once a program has served its purpose it needs to be de-allocated from the computing resource pool. (Eg: JVM provided by Java has a Garbage Collector which does a clean up periodically). The program Persephone was perhaps a supporting function to this Programmatic Garbage Collection, which is how they met.  <sep>  Q: What were the origins of Persephone in The Matrix: Reloaded?

input: CONTEXT: It looks like you're asking about the 1980 Stanley Kubrick movie. In that movie it's not clearly defined the exact location of the hotel. However we are given a few facts to narrow down the location: The Overlook is located somewhere in the Colorado Rockies. The Overlook is 25 miles from the nearest town; Sidewinder. Sidewinder however is a fictional town, so this doesn't provide any real help narrowing down the Overlook's location. (Thanks to Raidri for providing this information). The Overlook is within driving distance from Boulder Colorado (where The family is staying prior to going to the Overlook).  <sep>  Q: Where is The Shining set?

input: CONTEXT: SHIELD have been holding the Tesseract for a very long time since Howard Stark found it not long after Captain America went missing (close to World War 2). They have been studying its properties ever since. Also, Loki knows some of its power and secrets from Thanos as explained in the movie. Connect that with the slight influence Loki has over Selvig in credits scene for Thor.

It's something artful blossoming from humble origins (which is what Bing hopes Abi becomes, through the show, with his help) and a touch of humanity in a hi-tech existence. His speech near the end demonstrates how he yearns for the truth and how sick he is of fakery. The penguin he has in the end, though, is a more realistic, less crude sculpture that seems expensive.

In my opinion, it's on one hand a symbol of Bing succumbing to the inescapable artifice of his world after choosing to harness his 'truth' just to sell more products, and on the other a reminder of the love and authenticity he lost in Abi - or perhaps his attempt to preserve them in his upgraded, wealthier life.  <sep>  Q: What is the significance of the penguin in Fifteen Million Merits? A: it's on one hand a symbol of Bing succumbing to the inescapable artifice of his world after choosing to harness his 'truth' just to sell more products  Q: what is the meaning of its transition from paper penguin to a real looking one? A: Folding a 'worthless' wrapper into an origami penguin gives it meaning: it's a simple, hand-crafted token, and later comes to represent Bing and Abi's relationship  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: why does he weirdly stare at the statue penguin?

input: CONTEXT: The annoying phone ring in the Once Upon a Time in America scene you quoted, is there not for the purpose of annoying the viewer (which I admit id does a bit), but is there to share with the viewer and impress in the audience the feeling experienced by Noodles (De Niro). In order to reach the desidered effect, it has to be long and certainly not pleasant. The phone ring is not real, it's just in Noodles head and expresses the metaphorical ring of his guilty conscience, which is stirred in the opium den by the newspaper's headlines hovering over the photos of Max, Patsy and Cockeye that read ""Bootleggers trapped by Feds; Three Slain"". Noodles tries once again to obliterate the painful memory of his betrayal triggered by the newspaper by sucking greedily on the opium pipe, bu to no avail. The scene is also beautifully edited in reverse, thus the audience does really understand the meaning of the ringing phone only at the end of the sequence, when we see Noodles picking up the phone and calling the desk of Sergeant Halloran (we are only shown the nametag on his desk). When Halloran (or one of his agents) picks up, the ringing stops and is replaced by a deafening, high-pitched noise that forces Noodles to stand up, no matter the amount of opium smoked.

input: CONTEXT: The biggest reason is that they weren't prepared for an attack. The Lannister army wasn't supposed to be there, but rather defending King's Landing and Casterly Rock. Lady Tyrell even goes on to say that fighting was never really the Tyrell's strong suit, so in-universe it wasn't a surprise that they fell so quickly. Also, wealth doesn't equate to army size. Just because the Tyrell's have a lot of money doesn't mean that they have a huge army. In fact, house Lannister is in significant debt because of it's huge army and all of the fighting they've had to do over the last few years.  <sep>  Q: How was a powerful house so easily defeated?

The Joker's previous 'gag' - which also failed - was to try and get Gothamites to kill each other for own protection or self interest as he believed it would demonstrate a general moral bankruptcy. 'You failed to kill the lawyer...' - I cannot remember how the rest of the line goes but the boat finale appears to come from a desire to repeat the exercise and Batman puts the emphasis on all of this in his final rebuke. The film also goes a long way to show that both sets of passengers specifically reject the opportunity to kill each other - even for self defence.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The neighbor was shouting and pointing his finger towards the old man and that's what infuriated Caesar. He hated that gesture. Sometimes it happens with humans too and it makes us want to catch that finger and twist it hard. (But we don't do that :)) It's a natural emotion that comes to our mind, sometimes. My opinion is that Caesar did not want to bite it off, he just wanted to bite hard on that finger. Hard enough to cause bleeding. One more possibility is that in his anger, he closed his jaws on the finger but when the man started crying in pain he may have controlled himself and let him go. About losing the finger - losing the finger doesn't necessarily mean getting it bitten off. Maybe Caesar chewed it in a manner that it was badly damaged and may be the doctors advice to cut it off later.  <sep>  Q: not sure A: My opinion is that Caesar did not want to bite it off, he just wanted to bite hard on that finger  Q: yes, the film shows his finger and it just looks bloody ,not cut off A: One more possibility is that in his anger, he closed his jaws on the finger but when the man started crying in pain he may have controlled himself and let him go  Q: so it could have been an accident? A: Maybe Caesar chewed it in a manner that it was badly damaged and may be the doctors advice to cut it off later  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Was the finger shown on camera after that?

input: CONTEXT: Yes, it is very realistic. While ADHD seems to be about kids who have excess energy, what it really is about is the focus and concentration. ADHD is caused because the areas of the brain that control focus and concentration are UNDER-stimulated or under-activated. So, taking a stimulant, for those with ADHD, actually activates/enervates those portions of the brain. It seems to ""calm"" the afflicted child or adult, but what it's really doing is allowing them to focus their efforts and energy. Now, to someone who does not have under-stimulated brain function in the area of focus and control, it just has the general, overall stimulative effect because it is a stimulant, after all.  <sep>  Q: Realism of the effect of ADHD medicine in Desperate Housewives?

Once the appeals process is complete, or the time frame for filing appeal has run out, res judicata states that the suit cannot be brought again, even for new evidence (there are exceptions, such as proof of fraud).

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: There's no overarching right answer to this. I think there are a few reasons for it: For starters, it's fun. You've mentioned lots of directors in your question who have done it and it's likely they all got a pretty good kick out of it. Think Hitchcock's many roles or Tarantino in Reservoir Dogs, or Pulp Fiction. There's also a tradition argument. Stan Lee, for example, has done it for so long now that it's expected and many fans get enjoyment out of spotting him in each of his roles. The same applies to Hitchcock. After the fun and tradition reasons, it's certainly plausible to suggest because they can. Many directors don't have the fame or recognition for a cameo role to be significant. But if someone like Tarantino, Scorcese or Peter Jackson does it, it's instantly recognisable given their fame. This can be compared to other, less famous, directors who wouldn't be recognised. Therefore, it certainly carries that making cameos gives them airtime and keeps them recognisable in the public eye. These are just a few of the reasons. I'm sure other arguments could be made, such as the fact it saves money (such as in the case of a longer role, e.g. Tarantino in Django), but it seems to be mostly about a mixture of fun and tradition.  <sep>  Q: Why do directors make cameo appearances in their movies?

input: CONTEXT: I don't think it had any plot driven change. The Bond franchise was feeling threatened by newer spy movies (such as the Bourne series) which have more action, (slightly) more plausible plots (compared to ray-gun satellites etc), and have less comedic elements. A reboot with a new younger actor and a deliberate step away from some of the conventions of the franchise (gadgets & moneypenny for example) were their answer. They tried to take it this direction before - a Licence to Kill was a deliberate attempt with a drug-smuggling and revenge plot-line, but wasn't well done. They then decided to switch back to more 'classic' Bond approaches with Brosnan.  <sep>  Q: Why is James Bond less tech savvy in the Daniel Craig movies? A: The Bond franchise was feeling threatened by newer spy movies (such as the Bourne series) which have more action  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Were the movies altered to suit the audience?

Fact: Agamotto constructed the necklace to house the time stone, and while he was a powerful sorcerer (the first Sorcerer Supreme), he was still a mortal. Speculation: He was simply out of his depth. He was able to build a construct capable of housing and tapping in to the power of the time-stone, but was unaware or unable to tap into the full power of the stone effortlessly. The necklace required rigorous study of very specific spell-casting because that is how it was designed.

Arya came running and suddenly jumps towards Night King. He senses the movement and sound and grabs Arya by her neck by reflex. So, the intention was to stop and kill her. When Arya drops the dagger, Night King looks surprised. This shows he doesn't know what would happen next. There was no time to think and turn her into a white walker by touch. There was no planning in this scene like S04E04. First intent is to stop and kill Arya. We do not know what would he do if he killed her. Even if he had so much time, it's unclear whether Night King can turn adults directly into white walkers. It's neither hinted in the show or books.

(You might argue the opposite for 99% of all other director/studio combos.)  <sep>  Q: Does Ridley Scott's Director's Cut releases hurt his movies? A: To a strong movie fan, no, it cannot hurt - ever  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: What was his first director's cut?

input: CONTEXT: Science fiction appeals because of the mind-expanding quality, bizarre and unexpected scenarios in plausible ways. This often includes disorientation re: space and time, for example, in Planet of the Apes the planet turns out to be Earth, after the title implies some other world. Babylon A.D. also has a stop-short quality: if it doesn't quite make sense, that's the point. ""Babylon"" usually refers to the distant past or, as you say, the generic sense. ""A.D."" is both final and futuristic, not what we expect, this is neither the historical Babylon nor a generic reference. (If ""C.E."" is gradually being adopted, that adds to the effect.) Playfully bewildering titles aren't uncommon in fantastic films. One I've found intriguing is the U.S. title for Quatermass and the Pit (1967): Five Million Years to Earth. A few years later came Dracula A.D. 1972, and The X-Files did ""Hollywood A.D."" Thus, ""Babylon A.D."" seems less a plot reference (I haven't seen it) than an appeal to the tastes and cultural memory of s.f. viewers.  <sep>  Q: Why is the movie titled ""Babylon A.D.""?

input: CONTEXT: My personal interpretation: I don't know how Siamese twins are like to each other in the real world but in the movie the relationship between the two lead characters are shown very strange yet interesting. After watching the movie, two things were stuck in my head about these two characters, Théo (Louis Garrel) and Isabelle (Eva Green). 1 - They both share common interest, that's passion for movies. Through out the movie you see snippets of french classic movies (that's what I think they are.) and they role-play them and they lay bets on those movies. 2 - At any cost, they don't leave each other. The movie made me say this line because, from beginning, they sleep nude next to each other, they bath together and even sexuality (the intercourse between Isabelle and Matthew in the kitchen.) they took liberally. So, I'm not surprised that Isabelle did not choose to leave with Matthew. Simply, Isabelle won't either leave her twin brother or the love for movies.  <sep>  Q: Why Isabelle and Theo leave Matthew in the end?

input: CONTEXT: From reading the article that @Richard has linked in the comments, it is clear that there certainly is a subtext of a homoerotic nature between the two characters Mr. Orange and Mr. White. That's almost indisputable. However I never interpreted it that way when I watched it, I just assumed it was simply the building of a mutual respect, and a mentor/mentee relationship. However, as the article goes on to say that their relationship is similar to “wakashudo”, and knowing Tarantino's affinity with samurai culture (which he made 2 films about) it is very possible that this is the relationship dynamic he intended to portray. Of course, like most movies, it is open to interpretation.

Or possibly, if there was not a robust movie industry in that nation in the early 1980s, the quality of the output was considered pretty poor. Or some combination of the two. So, languages that were pretty common in the ""western"" and US part of the world would not work, even if the country was not really familiar (where the language was Spanish, French, German or Italian) or if there were not examples of any movies from a country. Portuguese? Maybe, but a Slavic or Balkan nation or language would be ideal for that line. Probably not Poland, because there was already a Polish stereotype about intelligence that was commonly used in jokes, so there might be some confusion about intent. ""Czech"" was merely chosen because it's a country an English speaking audience would be aware of, but there would be almost no movies, as of that time, that anyone could reference, making it an obscure scenario.

Any sheathed weapons, such as swords, would be on the shield side for a crossdraw, and thus away from the camera angle. There is one shot from a falling horse late in the scene where the hilt of a sheathed sword becomes briefly visible. Whether this sword is strapped to the horse (a common means of keeping secondary weapons), or belongs to one of the Scots on the ground, is difficult to determine. On the other hand, non-sheathed weapons such as maces, warhammers and battleaxes tended to be attached via a strap to the belt or trousers on the right hand side. These were common secondary weapons for knights, and we should be able to see some of them in the scene, but none are visible. Chances are you are correct, and these weapons were not included as part of the cavalry equipment. Most likely this was done to reduce the cost of filming. After all, the knights get slaughtered in the scene and we don't see any scenes where they get to fight back after falling from their horses, so these weapons are redundant from a filming standpoint.  <sep>  Q: Are the cavalry knights missing close melee weapons in Braveheart?

input: CONTEXT: When The Six Million Dollar Man premiered (1973) in the United States had just ended its involvement in the Vietnam War. The US military was not held in high regards in many circles and having Austin be a veteran might have been seen as ""problematic."" The pilot seems to have done away with this by having Austin be a civilian test pilot who was the only civilian ever sent to the Moon. After two additional television films (during which Steve Austin was returned to his former military rank) the series was picked up by ABC as a weekly series in 1974. The improbability of Austin having been a civilian astronaut was probably brought the attention of the producers who simply changed the back story during the second pilot film. In this respect, the television series began to match Martin Caidin's novels. The show later expanded upon Austin's background adding a family and then later love interest, Jamie Sommers, who herself became The Bionic Woman.  <sep>  Q: What plot points/cultural significance would making Steve Austin a civilian member of NASA have served?

(I looked for a clip, but could not find one. All the searches go directly to Harry and Umbridge.) Hermione then says that it is simple (a clear-cut case for which any teacher would act on behalf of the student). But Harry says something to the effect that whatever it is, it is not simple. And then he walks away. In the book, it's Ron that tells Harry that he should seek assistance from McGonagall. Harry retorts that he is not certain if she had enough pull to defy Umbridge. Then Ron suggests doing to Dumbledore. But Harry is upset with Dumbledore because he has refused to speak with Harry for the longest time. McGonagall does have a confrontation with Umbridge much later in the story, and for different reasons.  <sep>  Q: Did Harry Potter tell Professor McGonagall about Umbridge's punishment?

input: CONTEXT: The Yellow clothes are a type of 'Elder Endorsement', a ratification or 'pass'. The village guardians who dress up as the beasts know that if someone is dressed in yellow they have been given the Yellow cloak under the supervision of a village elder, so it is a sanctioned activity. If someone is found wandering without one, it will be assumed they're not supposed to be there. It's unlikely the 'beasts' would harm her, but they'd certainly interfere and try and scare her off/back to the village. Ivy possibly doesn't know what they're capable of. Of course, Ivy could at this point tell them she knows they're not really beasts and knows what they're doing, but within the narrative of the film her maintaining her cloak's yellow lustre removes that possibility.  <sep>  Q: Why was Ivy concerned with wiping the mud off of her yellow cloak? A: The village guardians who dress up as the beasts know that if someone is dressed in yellow they have been given the Yellow cloak under the supervision of a village elder  Q: And does that protect them in some way?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Ricin is extremely toxic. It has an LD50 (the lethal dose for 50% of people exposed) of 30–40mg per kilogram when ingested (its much much more dangerous when introduced to the body in other ways). Guessing Lydia's weight at around 50kg (110 lbs) would lead one to think the LD50 would be no more than 2g of ricin. It has a military-developed antidote, which has had only limited trials in humans. Ricin is a chemical subject to the Chemical Weapons Convention, in the same schedule as nerve agents Sarin and VX. (All this information gleaned from Wikipedia) Walt also only told her when she'd already begun to experience symptoms, so less likely to recover even if treated. Even if she sought attention and gave them this information it seems unlikely that she would recover. Even if she's not been given a lethal dose, survivors of ricin often suffer from long term organ damage, so she would have a pretty miserable and presumably shortened life even if she does survive. I think Walt probably weighed her slim improved chances of survival, against the pleasure of knowing that she was aware who had done this to her. I considered an answer like @Keen's too — perhaps she would not go to a hospital in fear of the attention, but I think this is less likely, even the risk averse would put fear of death above prison.  <sep>  Q: What is ricin?

input: CONTEXT: Ricin is extremely toxic. It has an LD50 (the lethal dose for 50% of people exposed) of 30–40mg per kilogram when ingested (its much much more dangerous when introduced to the body in other ways). Guessing Lydia's weight at around 50kg (110 lbs) would lead one to think the LD50 would be no more than 2g of ricin. It has a military-developed antidote, which has had only limited trials in humans. Ricin is a chemical subject to the Chemical Weapons Convention, in the same schedule as nerve agents Sarin and VX. (All this information gleaned from Wikipedia) Walt also only told her when she'd already begun to experience symptoms, so less likely to recover even if treated. Even if she sought attention and gave them this information it seems unlikely that she would recover. Even if she's not been given a lethal dose, survivors of ricin often suffer from long term organ damage, so she would have a pretty miserable and presumably shortened life even if she does survive. I think Walt probably weighed her slim improved chances of survival, against the pleasure of knowing that she was aware who had done this to her. I considered an answer like @Keen's too — perhaps she would not go to a hospital in fear of the attention, but I think this is less likely, even the risk averse would put fear of death above prison.  <sep>  Q: What is ricin? A: Ricin is a chemical subject to the Chemical Weapons Convention, in the same schedule as nerve agents Sarin and VX  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Could Lydia get medical help and survive a ricin poisoning?

input: CONTEXT: It was acid. Just not a melt your face off type acid. It bleached their skin and discolored their hair and clothing. It likely also affected them mentally, but it's debatable if it made them crazy or just proved that they were. It is implied to be the same Ace chemical factory that the Joker is said to have fall in to make him as pale green as we know him. The significance of the scene is to establish that Joker maybe somehow also actually cared about Harley instead of just toying with her. His face before jumping down seems to show some internal conflict, as of he himself disliked that he felt something for her, which pushed him to save her against his normal desire to kill people. It's also to establish how Harley became like she did, her look. That she voluntarily became like that, out of a type of mad love for Mistah J. Unlike her recent comic reboot where he threw her into the acid against her will. The comics make him rapier than the movie. Then again, as this is a flashback of an ""unreliable narrator"" like batshit crazy Harley, we don't know if that's an accurate flashback. For one, she wouldn't have been able to see what Joker does after she fell. Line of Sight issues.  <sep>  Q: what is the significance of the acid scene in ""Suicide Squad""?

input: CONTEXT: Recall how Marcelle does the final preparations for setting the theater on fire - he blocks the auditorium doors with a crowbar and then proceeds to behind the screen and starts waiting for Shoshanna's ""message"" to appear on the screen. Before he does so the two men from the Basterds leave the auditorium and proceed to some side corridors to get to the side balcony and attack Hitler. Some time after they leave the auditorium Marcelle comes to the doors and blocks them. The balcony where Hitler sits with Himmler has a separate door guarded by two German soldiers. The two Basterds kill the guards, rush into the balcony and shoot Hitler. Right after that the ""message"" appears and Marcelle sets the pile of films behind the screen on fire. So the balcony doors are not blocked - Hitler likely can escape the theater or at least gain some time and space and have better chances to have been resqued. He definitely has much better chances than those people who are in the auditorium - those are blocked between the locked doors and bursting flames - but he is at least not in the auditorium and so less exposed to the dangers and has a chance to use the side corridors to escape.

Before he does so the two men from the Basterds leave the auditorium and proceed to some side corridors to get to the side balcony and attack Hitler. Some time after they leave the auditorium Marcelle comes to the doors and blocks them. The balcony where Hitler sits with Himmler has a separate door guarded by two German soldiers. The two Basterds kill the guards, rush into the balcony and shoot Hitler. Right after that the ""message"" appears and Marcelle sets the pile of films behind the screen on fire. So the balcony doors are not blocked - Hitler likely can escape the theater or at least gain some time and space and have better chances to have been resqued. He definitely has much better chances than those people who are in the auditorium - those are blocked between the locked doors and bursting flames - but he is at least not in the auditorium and so less exposed to the dangers and has a chance to use the side corridors to escape. The two Basterds shooting him on the balcony make that totally impossible.  <sep>  Q: Would Hitler have died in the fire anyway if the Basterds hadn't shot him? A: the balcony doors are not blocked - Hitler likely can escape the theater or at least gain some time and space and have better chances to have been resqued  Q: What did the basterds do? A: The two Basterds kill the guards, rush into the balcony and shoot Hitler  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Who were the basterds?

input: CONTEXT: According to the narrative of the program, it seems that Walter White is dead. However, if one looks at how he was wounded it is conceivable that he wouldn't have died from the wound that he received and that he simply became unconscious at the end of the episode. While an M-60 fires a 7.62 (.30 cal) round, its bullets are copper jacket military rounds. These rounds don't expand and often inflict non-fatal wounds if they don't strike major organs or blood vessels. As demonstrated in the episode ""Felina"", the series denouement, Walter isn't struck directly by a rounds but is hit by a ricochet. This could cause a serious injury and perhaps an incapacitating one; however death seems to be a stretch. Assuming that Walt's injury (on his lower right side) could have struck his liver or his renal artery and thus caused him to bleed out internally. Unfortunately, such a wound would have made it impossible for him to have walked out of the neo-Nazi's hideout and around for what would have been at least ten minutes. Given that the police shown to have arrived within seconds of Walt's collapse, he could have easily been saved if paramedics had been called. The series states that Walter White is dead. The injury that he received could have been easily survivable.  <sep>  Q: Is Walter White dead?

input: CONTEXT: Supernatural is inspired from several folk lore, legends, myths and a creative team. So most of it is born out of the existing myths out there. Of course, the team goes on to make some stuff of their own. The thing is, Supernatural borrows from myths all over the world. The salt thing and devil's trap are myths that exist.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: No, I would not classify B-Movie as a genre. The name came from the fact that it used to be the second movie of a double-bill, and was usually low budget and shorter than the other. Nowadays we think of a B-Movie in a broader sense of being a low budget commercial movie, and has some overlap with Exploitation movies, but they can cover multiple genres including Horror as you mention. Science Fiction & Westerns are genres that have produced many B-Movies. The Italians were famous for producing 'Peplum' movies - also known as 'Swords and Sandals' movies. It is true that there was a 'golden age' of B-Movies and that there are certain traits that might make you think 'this is a b-movie', but I do not think they would form a recognized genre in their own right. Yes, director's would often know they were making a B-Movie - explicitly because it had a low budget and was destined to accompany a main feature. This might impart some of the characteristics that people love or hate about B-Movies, but it doesn't make it a genre IMHO.  <sep>  Q: Is B Movie a genre?
output: ",Yes
