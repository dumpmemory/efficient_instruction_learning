input: CONTEXT: I think the similarities are coincidental. The Johnny B. Goode scene ties directly back to the start of the film, where Marty is auditioning for the school program, and his band is rejected for being ""too loud."" In talking about the filming of the scene, Michael J. Fox says, ""My favorite part of the original Back to the Future, filmed in 1985, was the Johnny B. Goode sequence during the “Enchantment Under the Sea” dance. As a frustrated musician, I was in my glory, learning the guitar chords and lead solo arrangements, as well as working with a choreographer to mimic and incorporate into the production number the signature styles and stage moves of my rock and roll heroes.” (Lucky Man: A Memoir, p, 144) Top Secret was actually a parody of Elvis films (imdb, Wikipedia, Rotten Tomatoes), so it had a different inspiration.  <sep>  Q: Was the Johnny B.

input: CONTEXT: A properly executed plot twist often causes opposite reactions of what you've just described. People want to watch the movie again because the ending was so unexpected that they need to review the whole thing to get all the puzzle pieces together. ""Fight Club"" is a great example, in my opinion. There's a lot of dialogue (especially the lines from Helena Bonham Carter) that doesn't make any sense if you don't know the ending.

input: CONTEXT: The Avengers is an Initiative: a sanctioned team brought together to defend the world against threats beyond the scope of SHIELD and the world's governments. Captain America is the first Avenger not only because he was the first to be recruited (Thor doesn't even know about the Avengers until partway through the movie: even Stark was aware of their existence before then), but because the super-soldier program of the 1940's was a wartime pre-cursor to the Avengers program, albeit one that was stalled by espionage. Captain America was quite clearly the first member of the team to sign up to a government initiative to defend innocent life. Ruben Studdard was 25 when he won American Idol in the 2nd Series, and Kelly Clarkson was only 20 when she won the first series. We don't refer to Studdard as the first American Idol winner, do we?  <sep>  Q: Why do we say that Captain America is the first avenger? A: because he was the first to be recruited  Q: So, Thor was recruited after him even though he is older? A: Thor doesn't even know about the Avengers until partway through the movie: even Stark was aware of their existence before then  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: So Captain America is more important than Thor?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I'm convinced it was left vague on purpose. A recurring theme in the show is to hint at potential plot points in the future, while leaving the possibility open that it is just ignored. Dan Harmon has stated before that they don't really plan out the future details well in advance. They leave multiple different options open until the time comes to use a plot point. Then it becomes cannon. They want us to question if Beth is real or a clone going forward. That said, if Beth is a clone, I don't think we will find out for sure until there is a good reason to reveal that information. They now have another back-pocket dues ex machina where ""real"" Beth can always come out of nowhere and change any situation. Rick also makes it pretty clear that the audience wont really be able to tell either. He says ""Either way, you chill the f** out"" (or something like that); meaning we can't definitively say Beth's new behaviour is from cloning or just a new outlook. The ambiguity is essentially confirmed to be on purpose around 1:30 in this video from the writers/creators: (it's an adultswim link, might be region locked, I'm not sure, let me know if if it is). Also in Season 3 episode 10 Beth has to question this for herself, and it leads to the secondary plot in the episode.  <sep>  Q: What is Beth's other option if she does not leave?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Louise has a unique understanding of the language. Many of the scientists have worked out some of the vocabulary and seem to have made some progress in communication. But Louise has immersed herself more in the language than the others. But the implications are not apparent until very late. In a final splurge of communication, done as the scientists start to panic about the reaction of the other nations to the partial communications they have interpreted, the aliens send a very rich message: not one word but a whole screenful of words. Nobody can make sense of it until Louise has a moment of insight and can read it all and get the point of it. Only at this moment does the full intent of the language have an effect on her: and when it does it rewrites her sense of time. She then uses this knowledge of the future to avert a potential catastrophe. We only see the implications of this in the postscript (which may be actually her memory of the future) where many of the players meet for the first time at a celebration of her book on the language and one of them triggers her memory of what she did to talk down the hostility. The key point is that she is the first person to completely grasp the alien language and therefore the first to experience its ability to undo her brain's sense of linear time.  <sep>  Q: Why was Louise the only one who advances her mind?

Those days no one dared to do anything to a policeman, especially a Captain. It means bringing wrath of force and media on the whole family. Second, Micheal was checked for arms/guns or weapons while in the car sent by Solozzo. So, he was not supposed to have gun. The only man with a gun was the Captain, who was on Solozzo's side. Thirdly, Micheal was not even supposed to know where they were meeting until the end. Solozzo was confident that he could not plant a weapon or a man at the meeting place. The Corleone family got this information by paying some man from the Solozzo gang. Fourth, Micheal did not seem that harmful, as he recently joined family that to be until Don was in hospital. In fact, he was not involved in family business that time. All the above conclude that the only man who was at risk was Micheal. The countermeasures taken by Micheal for having a place with people, it works both ways. Micheal was also not supposed to be able to kill in front of people.  <sep>  Q: Why did Sollozzo risk it?

input: CONTEXT: Jon did not commit to murdering Daenerys when he came to the Throne room. The first thing he did was lash out at her about killing innocent civilians and prisoners of war. He had been a passive partner to Daenerys these last few episodes. He lashed out in anger because he wanted Daenerys to see reason. To snap her out of the cloud of smoke to see the rubble she had laid on ground. The next thing he does is plead to her to see reason. To give mercy to Tyrion and the rest. Daenerys at this moment is now convinced that she knows what's right for the people. The last thing he does is asks her plainly as to ""what about the people who think they know what's best for them"". She replies that they don't have a choice. After making every effort to redeem Daenerys in his eyes, he fails and decides to kill her. He loves her still and proclaims her the queen, now and always. Kisses her back, embrace her in his arms and stabs her in the heart.  <sep>  Q: Why did Jon Snow do this immoral act if he is so honorable? A: After making every effort to redeem Daenerys in his eyes, he fails and decides to kill her  Q: Why did he back stab her? A: He loves her still and proclaims her the queen, now and always  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Did she know that he had a weapon?

input: CONTEXT: Under civil law frameworks based on common law (which we have in the US), there is the doctrine of res judicata -- or ""already judged."" Once the appeals process is complete, or the time frame for filing appeal has run out, res judicata states that the suit cannot be brought again, even for new evidence (there are exceptions, such as proof of fraud). Its purpose is to strike a balance between the rights of the defendants and plantiffs as well as to make the courts run more efficiently ... kind of like the principle of double jeopardy under criminal law. The U.S. military has affirmed it holds to the doctrine of res judicata. So in this episode, where the time for an appeal of the original case had likely long expired, it could not be brought again, as it would be dismissed as already ruled upon.  <sep>  Q: Does it seem to you that The Good wife season 4 episode 6 ending was wrong?

input: CONTEXT: The ""Joey room"" isn't intended as a permanent residence for Joey. At his own surprised reaction you can already see that there was never a plan to have Joey living with them in their house. That would be a stetch even for Joey's and Chandler's relationship to have him living with Chandler and Monica in their house. Rather than that, the room is likely intended as a guest room dedicated specifically for Joey whenever he visits them and stays at their house. Either that or a kind of ""hobby room"" for Chandler and Joey to hang out in whenever he visits. The comment is rather tongue-in-cheek to begin with, so it's likely not a room only for Joey. It's a reminiscence to the good times Joey and Chandler had and a reassurance for him that those times, while maybe getting fewer, won't stop just because he got his own house to live in with Monica, a reminder that there will always be someone to play foosball with.  <sep>  Q: Did Joey get to live with Chandler and Monica?

input: CONTEXT: As noted in the comments, as seen during the events of Captain America, Winter Soldier, Hydra had infiltrated every level of SHIELD by the 2010s. We know that SHIELD was already doing alien weapon research (The Destroyer weapon that Coulson used) and Hydra Tesseract weapon research (Hydra guns Cap found on the helicarrier). They even ""converted"" Hydra scientists, like Arnim Zola, whom in turn decided to poison SHIELD from the inside. By 2010s, Hydra agents were everywhere, from low level rank and file, special agents (Jasper Sitwell), elite soldiers (STRIKE team leader Brock Rumlow), the World Security Council (Alexander Pierce), and even senators (Senator Stern, the prick from Iron Man). These two factors combined, would have meant SHIELD either intentionally set up to study the Leviathan for further benefit, or Hydra intercepted it, as they did the Scepter in the Winter Soldier stinger. It's highly likely that the Hydra base was a black site bankrolled by SHIELD until it collapsed.  <sep>  Q: How do HYDRA get the Leviathan to Strucker's base?

input: CONTEXT: I don't think it's a Czech-specific quip, actually. I believe the idea is that the lines are crude and not very intelligently written, as if someone were translating actual decent dialogue from a language they have poor command of, making the translation very rudimentary and child-like. Or possibly, if there was not a robust movie industry in that nation in the early 1980s, the quality of the output was considered pretty poor. Or some combination of the two. So, languages that were pretty common in the ""western"" and US part of the world would not work, even if the country was not really familiar (where the language was Spanish, French, German or Italian) or if there were not examples of any movies from a country. Portuguese? Maybe, but a Slavic or Balkan nation or language would be ideal for that line. Probably not Poland, because there was already a Polish stereotype about intelligence that was commonly used in jokes, so there might be some confusion about intent. ""Czech"" was merely chosen because it's a country an English speaking audience would be aware of, but there would be almost no movies, as of that time, that anyone could reference, making it an obscure scenario. They could have easily used Romania, Bulgaria, but could not use Latvia, Estonia, Ukraine, etc (nations that were, at that time, considered part of the USSR).  <sep>  Q: What's wrong with subtitles for a Czech movie, as referenced in Tootsie?

input: CONTEXT: Eloise Hawking was one of the Others. As such, she had been communicating with the MIB (at least during Ben Linus' reign as leader of the Others). The 'loophole' was part of MIB's years in the making plan to escape the island, and as such MIB would have provided Eloise/The Others with pieces of the plan that they needed to contribute to. The Others have reliable ways of communicating and traveling to/from the Island. That's the (admittedly off-camera, and not fully explained in the show) way that she would know of the need to have Locke on the plane. However, she was also responsible for getting Desmond onto the Island originally. In the final season it was revealed that Desmond was part of a plot that Widmore and Hawking enacted to kill the MIB. Desmond's ability to survive exposure to large amounts of electromagnetism was used to get him to the heart of the Island, where he temporarily disabled the MIB's immortality. So presumably Eloise took orders from the MIB. But also, at some point (likely after realizing she'd shot her own time-traveling son), she started enacting a plan to kill the MIB. Widmore worked with her on this, although he likely started contributing later, as he was working to dethrone Linus until pretty late in the show.  <sep>  Q: Eloise Hawking's connection to MIB and the loophole A: The 'loophole' was part of MIB's years in the making plan to escape the island  Q: Do you think Eloise was cooperating with MIB? A: Eloise took orders from the MIB  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Was she manip;ulated somehow by MIB with her knowing through an other way you never saw on the show?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I thought the film's use of the theme was much more politicized than the book's. In the book, when Kenny says that he and George are invisible, I wasn't quite sure what he meant. In the movie, invisibility has been threaded throughout much more explicitly: in the classroom scene George clearly describes “invisible minorities” to his class. I took this as the filmmaker's attempt to make the historical particularities of George's situation clear. In the book, however, Kenny's comment sort of complicates George's understanding of his own minority position. Throughout the book, George believes his pain is invisible to others because society has refused to acknowledge his relationship. He thinks this is a somewhat unique situation, because of his position as a gay man in a homophobic society. Kenny's comment, however, suggests that invisibility is more inclusive than that. Perhaps Kenny means that they're invisible because they're out when no one expects them to be out, or because their homosocial behavior isn't understood by society, or because they're powerless to stop the Cuban Missile Crisis. Or, perhaps Kenny knows that George is gay and is trying to have an experience by sharing the evening with him. I don't know and I don't think we're supposed to know. One of the fantastic things about this novel for me is the way it explodes the idea that we grow closer to others by understanding them better. Caring, closeness, and love in the novel aren't degraded by failures of understanding.  <sep>  Q: What is the meaning of Kenny's words in this scene?

input: CONTEXT: He starts walking as soon as he pushes her, and he's halfway up the stairs by the time bystanders notice she's under the train. He walks quickly but calmly, he doesn't run away. In unremarkable clothing, it isn't strange that no one stopped him. As for security systems, if you watch more of the series, you'll notice that Frank is always aware of when he is being recorded. I don't believe his action was spur of the moment. He chose to meet her there and do the deed because he had an way out where any recording of him wouldn't be enough to identify him, especially with the hat and glasses. Would that be possible in the real world? Could there actually be a blind spot all the way out of the station? Unclear. Her death was likely ruled an accident because metro police departments are overworked, and there isn't any immediate evidence to the contrary. The fact that they wouldn't find the angle and direction of her fall suspicious bother me too, I don't have an answer for that.  <sep>  Q: About Zoe Barnes in the second season of House of Cards

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: You think that a large deployment of troops would somehow be immune from the black market abundance of illicit material? Even in real life, drugs, alcohol, and illicit materials are abundant in field ops. It would not be unheard of or even unexpected for soldiers to have access to alcohol. Most of the soldiers at the base would be there voluntarily, and would not be patted down or strip searched. Put it this way, J Squads direct drill Sargent was against poker or card games and J Squad had a poker game going. Alcohol is just as easy to bring. That said, Cage had plenty of opportunities to find illicit stashes of alcohol or drugs, both on base and off. From his various loops, he obviously didn't sleep that night between waking up at the DS kicks and the moving out, and he could have found alcohol on base or off. He would have been back before deployment if he wanted. It was N+x day, where N is the number of interactions we have seen and X is the number we haven't. Cage has seen many iterations not shown in the film.  <sep>  Q: Where could Cage get alcohol on base? A: Even in real life, drugs, alcohol, and illicit materials are abundant in field ops.

input: CONTEXT: You can safely watch Season 5 of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. without worrying about spoiling the end of Infinity War. There are no spoilers made, and only some very vague references to the beginning of Infinity War, and none to the movie's climax. The references are slim and not relevant to the plot of the show, and are a lot less tied into the show than the Winter Soldier reveals to Season 1 (where they were essential to understanding the plot) or even the vague references to Thor 2 earlier in that season, where the agents come to play clean-up after the events of the movie.

input: CONTEXT: I don't have a source but I am fairly certain, Daenerys didn't know about Jon visiting Tyrion in the cell because of the later scene with her and Jon and her reaction to Jon asking mercy for Tyrion. Then the question comes, why did Unsullied let Jon through. We saw in S08E05 that Tyrion managed to see Jaime after convincing the guarding Unsullied that he has a higher authority then the person they possibly got their orders from. They have seen Jon by her side when she's standing on King's Landing steps and proclaiming her victory and further conquest. So they know he is a close ally to her. They must have gotten their orders from Grey Worm or some other officers to guard the prisoner but when they see Jon, a close ally of Dany and a Commander of the Northern forces, they let him through because they know he has a higher authority and possibly Queen's confidence in the visit  <sep>  Q: Did the queen allow Jon to visit Tyrion?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The people of Dark City are kept in the city in darkness. Part of the way the Strangers keep the human populous from suspecting they are part of an experiment is to keep them from realizing that fact. So, they implant them with memories of being outside the city, in the daylight, to keep them docile. Shell Beach, in particular, represents hope. Without the belief that there is something better just outside the city, the humans would likely go mad with the realization that they are stuck in an elaborate prison. Of course, since there is no actual Shell Beach, they keep the memories vague, so that everyone thinks they know where it is, but can't give clear directions. Nobody questions this because they've all been programmed by the Strangers not to -- until John Murdock comes along. John Murdock knows there's something wrong with the city, and his partial memory implant gives him glimpses of Shell Beach, which he latches onto as a means of unraveling the mysteries of the city. John lacks the programming to accept things as they are, and his questions eventually lead Bumstead, who has been programmed to be a detective, to join him. He is, in essence, looking for hope, and in the end, he must create it himself.  <sep>  Q: Why did the Strangers make up Shell Beach in human's heads when they were not even supposed to go there?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Having seen the movie several times, I don't think anything was ""dragging"" the girl (Carina, possibly?) towards the Infinity Stone other than her own desire. She had just finished listening to Tanleer explain how powerful the stone is, and earlier in the movie we had seen how he verbally abuses her and forces her to do very menial and back-breaking work. She saw the stone as a possibility to escape. What you're interpreting as her being pulled toward the stone, I think, is actually her being very hesitant to touch it. Her own internal conflict between the need to escape her situation vs. her fear of the stone is what makes her take so long to try and grab it, but obviously, her desire to be free wins out.  <sep>  Q: What dragged the Collector's servant towards the Infinity Stone?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: It is a common fact on TV that combat and injuries are stylized to make it look good rather than realistic. Have a look at pretty much any film fight where someone knows a martial art and compare that to someone who knows a martial art fighting for real. They are worlds apart. Even if you look at American Wrestling and BJJ you can see the difference. Knocking someone out with one punch is extremely difficult, especially if they are used to combat. I have taken an unpulled hit from a quarter staff on the top of my head which caused me to blackout later but I still didn't go down at the time. After almost 20 years of martial arts and living in rough areas I have only been knocked unconscious with one punch once, when I was 17 by the European Kickboxing champion. I was punched to the ground by a bouncer in Portsmouth when I was 20 but was still conscious until he stamped on my head. Most of the people in the Walking Dead would have starved or succumb to injuries by now if they were suffering this scenario for real. Not to mention being struck down by illness. It is just a convention of the media that people are routinely knocked out in one hit and recover completely when the plot demands it and don't when the plot demands that instead.  <sep>  Q: Are there a lot of head injuries in the Walking Dead?

The Guardian tells them all will be set back to normal and they will be returned as though nothing happened. The Guardian sends them back. Also notice they come back with uniforms back on, where at the point in the episode, Kirk and Spock do not have theirs on. Edit addition: To clarify something to bring this all together for you. How did Kirk, Spock, and McCoy go through the portal in the first place? They jumped. They jumped in, McCoy first, followed by Kirk and Spock. They came back in the same manner, only Spock and Kirk come back first because they entered the timeline first. The jumping motion was one contiguous motion as seen from the crew left on the planet. Scotty also says to them, ""You just left."" The Guardian puts them back just as he found them, jumping through the portal.  <sep>  Q: How did they get back in “City on the Edge of Forever”?

input: CONTEXT: They get affected by lightning just like anyone else would be - they're still human (ok, metahuman).

As we've seen before with other metas who harness electrical powers, Barry can still take an electrical hit and be hurt by it, and lightning is just a large electrical charge.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: To a strong movie fan, no, it cannot hurt - ever. An alternate (possibly revisionist) version of a movie cannot detract from the original viewing experience, it can only add an additional positive (or negative) experience. In the case of Ridley and Blade Runner, I have every version, and his “Final Cut” is my favorite, and I am pleased-giddy that he was able to get yet another version released. It is my opinion that, given 4+ versions, you have the luxury of choosing the one you enjoy most. You have nothing but upside! Any downside is for pessimists, or people who have undue hatred for capitalist who play their little games – while we are still free to play ours. In the case of his refusal to agree to a Director's Cut of Prometheus – that is cool too. I enjoy the fact that as an artist Ridley Scott wraps his arms fully around the meta concept of additional releases, and indeed incorporates that into the overall art – like Claude Monet's Water Lilies, or Haystacks – as long as HE is making the decisions. (You might argue the opposite for 99% of all other director/studio combos.)  <sep>  Q: Does Ridley Scott's Director's Cut releases hurt his movies?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Louise has a unique understanding of the language. Many of the scientists have worked out some of the vocabulary and seem to have made some progress in communication. But Louise has immersed herself more in the language than the others. But the implications are not apparent until very late. In a final splurge of communication, done as the scientists start to panic about the reaction of the other nations to the partial communications they have interpreted, the aliens send a very rich message: not one word but a whole screenful of words. Nobody can make sense of it until Louise has a moment of insight and can read it all and get the point of it. Only at this moment does the full intent of the language have an effect on her: and when it does it rewrites her sense of time. She then uses this knowledge of the future to avert a potential catastrophe. We only see the implications of this in the postscript (which may be actually her memory of the future) where many of the players meet for the first time at a celebration of her book on the language and one of them triggers her memory of what she did to talk down the hostility. The key point is that she is the first person to completely grasp the alien language and therefore the first to experience its ability to undo her brain's sense of linear time.  <sep>  Q: Why was Louise the only one who advances her mind?

input: CONTEXT: Of course this changes from country to country, but generally speaking it's not illegal to film on the streets, since it's a public area. Most car scenes are recorded with chroma just for pratical reasons. In a professional production you look for ""quality"" and you can achieve it only if you have control. It's all about control. With a studio setting you get full control of the lights, the movements, etc. in one word, the scene. And of course, you minimize the hitches that can occurs in the real world (also safety concers).

input: CONTEXT: We don't know. All we know is that Chiron assaulted him with the chair. Certainly he was injured but we don't know the severity of the injuries. Given that Chiron is only sent to juvie it's extremely unlikely that Terrel was killed. Thus a charge of the Assault variety would seem likely but that is also unknown.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: As a writing device, it's far funnier to let the viewers imagination run away with the wild descriptions that Howard gives. Additionally, by not showing Howards mother, the writers are able to characterize and describe her any way they like, without having to find an actor who lives up to that description. Howard repeatedly describes his mother as having no neck, facial-hair that needs to be removed, and at one point, it was mentioned that she wears a wig. Howards mother is essentially a charicature of an overbearing, overprotective, troubled but caring, single-parent. Now imagine if we were to actually see Mrs. Wolowitz's reactions when Howard yells at her. Perhaps we would start to feel uncomfortable witnessing this coddled, well-off guy in his 20's, yelling at this morbidly obese, lonely woman. By not showing his mother, the audience can separate the charicature of the woman from the far less funny ""reality.""  <sep>  Q: Why is Howard Wolowitz' mother not shown in The Big Bang Theory?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Oh, it's quite simple really. It's alphabetical. Chinese word for car is 汽車 which is anglicized as Qìchē and read as Quizhe, thus making it after the word Quiz. R goes after letter Q in the alphabet. It is believable that the word Qìchē is the last section in the library's Q section before the R section, while the ""Rash"" section is possibly the first section in the library's R section. It might be the small or ""weird"" library, having many books on odd subjects. That is if you ignore other words starting with R which would come before the word rash, such as race (verb) racial (adjective) radiation radical (adjective) radio (noun) rage rail (noun) railroad (noun) rain rain forest raise (verb) range (noun) rank (noun) rapid (adjective) rare (adjective) rarely It should also be pointed out that almost all those previous words when read start with Re- while the rash is the first one which actually reads like Ra-.

Both organizations are playing a long game in this. There was no expected immediate payout in the plan. If they arrest him, they would reveal their hand in the events and blow the operation.

input: CONTEXT: I'm afraid you completely misunderstood a lot of the movie. At the start of the movie, Hal is already dead (killed himself in prison). Those scenes with Hal (mostly in New York) were all flashbacks. The present is with sister in San Francisco. Jasmine meets Dwight at a party in San Francisco. This is long after Hal killed himself. But to your question: ""Why did Jasmine arrest Hal?"" It was purely a spur of the moment, revenge thing.

input: CONTEXT: Ricin is extremely toxic. It has an LD50 (the lethal dose for 50% of people exposed) of 30–40mg per kilogram when ingested (its much much more dangerous when introduced to the body in other ways). Guessing Lydia's weight at around 50kg (110 lbs) would lead one to think the LD50 would be no more than 2g of ricin. It has a military-developed antidote, which has had only limited trials in humans. Ricin is a chemical subject to the Chemical Weapons Convention, in the same schedule as nerve agents Sarin and VX. (All this information gleaned from Wikipedia) Walt also only told her when she'd already begun to experience symptoms, so less likely to recover even if treated. Even if she sought attention and gave them this information it seems unlikely that she would recover. Even if she's not been given a lethal dose, survivors of ricin often suffer from long term organ damage, so she would have a pretty miserable and presumably shortened life even if she does survive. I think Walt probably weighed her slim improved chances of survival, against the pleasure of knowing that she was aware who had done this to her. I considered an answer like @Keen's too — perhaps she would not go to a hospital in fear of the attention, but I think this is less likely, even the risk averse would put fear of death above prison.  <sep>  Q: What is ricin? A: Ricin is a chemical subject to the Chemical Weapons Convention, in the same schedule as nerve agents Sarin and VX  Q: Could Lydia get medical help and survive a ricin poisoning? A: Even if she sought attention and gave them this information it seems unlikely that she would recover  Q: Did Walter want Lydia to survive? A: I think Walt probably weighed her slim improved chances of survival, against the pleasure of knowing that she was aware who had done this to her  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Who'se phone did Walter use to call Lydia?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Yes, it is very realistic. While ADHD seems to be about kids who have excess energy, what it really is about is the focus and concentration. ADHD is caused because the areas of the brain that control focus and concentration are UNDER-stimulated or under-activated. So, taking a stimulant, for those with ADHD, actually activates/enervates those portions of the brain. It seems to ""calm"" the afflicted child or adult, but what it's really doing is allowing them to focus their efforts and energy.

input: CONTEXT: The money belonged to Barr so it had his fingerprints on it. The gun was also Barr's as was the van. The whole point of Charlie's actions were to frame Barr for the killing. He had befriended Barr to get close to him and was close enough to be able to drug him and take the various pieces of property away from Barr's house and to return them with incriminating evidence without Barr realising he'd been set up. If I remember correctly the movie shows a jar filled with coins on Barr's desk. Presumably Charlie just took one of these to leave that final piece of incriminating evidence in the multi-story car park.  <sep>  Q: How did Charlie get Barr Finger prints? A: Charlie just took one of these to leave that final piece of incriminating evidence  Q: What did Charlie take one of?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Mike has not spent a dime of Fring's drug money, which is revealed when he is first interrogated by the DEA. All Mike's earnings from Fring's employment are put away for his grand-daughter. Thus perhaps his PI work for Goodman covers his living costs. Technically this might be a conflict of interest, but these are not moral, law-abiding citizens. Additionally, working for Goodman allows Mike to keep an eye on Walt and Jesse, who are very much part of Fring's interests. This would explain why Gus would allow Mike to work for Goodman. Now if Goodman were to ask Mike to tail Fring, Fring might have put a stop to Mike's extra work.  <sep>  Q: Why would Mike need a part time job as a PI for Saul?

input: CONTEXT: It's not the same attack. In the first movie, Neo enters Smith's code and basically decompiles him from the inside, which presumably destroys him (though we know enough of him survives to resurface with ""upgrades"" taken from Neo). In the third movie, Smith overwrites Neo's RSI, which, because Neo is hooked into the Matrix directly from the machine city at the time, gives the machine city the opening they need to pump an antivirus into the Matrix and cleanse all of the Smith-infected code.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I think it was worded that way for pragmatic reasons. Peter Jackson didn't want to tell the story of Sméagol until after the character Gollum was established. In The Fellowship of the Ring, the viewer is intended to see Gollum as a sort of beast. In The Two Towers, he has a much larger role and seems sort of halfway between beast and person, but a viewer who has not read the books is still unlikely to guess that he is a corrupted hobbit. The Return of the King opens with the story of Sméagol and Déagol to shed new light on who Gollum is, where he came from, why the Ring means so much to him, and what kind of influence the Ring wields over him. It is a bit of a shocking scene; the shock would not be nearly as strong if the viewer already knew Gollum's origin. So, in the opening of The Fellowship of the Ring, that Gollum was once a hobbit named Sméagol is an extraneous detail. While ""the Ring came to Gollum"" is an oversimplification, it was a necessary one; it told the viewer what he needed to know at that point in the story and no more.  <sep>  Q: Why does the narrator say 'The ring came to the creature Gollum'? A: In The Fellowship of the Ring, the viewer is intended to see Gollum as a sort of beast  Q: What wass the reason for making him appear as the beast? A: Peter Jackson didn't want to tell the story of Sméagol until after the character Gollum was established  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Was he corrupted before he got the ring?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: It's unlikely they made any money from the sales of ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" that happened during the movie. When they recorded the song originally, they were asked to sign papers, and paid $10 each for the work. Most likely they were signing the rights to the recording over to the station owner in exchange for a quick payment. The ""band"" themselves had no idea they were popular until they sang at Stoke's fund raiser, as evidence by the claim that ""no one will believe we're a real band"", and the shock at the crowd's reaction to their song. We don't have any idea what happened to them after the end of the movie, but it would be reasonable to expect they eventually got signed to a record contract. The governor would probably have wanted them to keep recording music, if nothing else, so he could continue to ride their popularity. That contract would have covered any future recordings; it's also possible they could negotiate royalties for future sales of their hit song, and the station owner would cave in to keep them happy. But that's just speculation, since the last we know of the boys they're going to go work for the governor.  <sep>  Q: Who is the radio owner? A: Stoke  Q: Did the actual band ever get a contract signed? A: When they recorded the song originally, they were asked to sign papers, and paid $10 each for the work  Q: What was the name of the song? A: Man of Constant Sorrow  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: What was the name of the movie?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The comic states that the Radioactive spider was created by experimenting on Peter Parker's blood (by Oscorp). However, there is no mention of this in the movie whatsoever. There are two possibilities: 1) That the spider in the film was also part of some lab experiments based on the blood of Peter Parker of that universe (the one who dies). 2) That the spider came from another universe. The question then is ""how did the spider get to the universe before the portal was opened?"". The answer to that would be ""The spider came from another universe and traveled back in time just like Gwen did"". However, to keep things simple, we can assume that Oscorp was up to no good and were experimenting with Peter's blood and Miles got bit by it. We already know that happened in the comics.  <sep>  Q: Which dimension did the radioactive spider which bit Miles come from?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Luke had discovered that his father was a Jedi and that he had some skill with the force from his time with Obi-Wan. He was advised by Ghost Obi-Wan to seek out Yoda to further his training. So he seeks out Yoda for training. Leia on the other hand does not know of her parentage, had not experimented with any Force training and had no time with Obi-Wan at all. She does not even really understand the Force, never mind seeking out a master for her training. I think it is also clear that Leia is not as inherently strong with the force as Luke. Vader has her in captivity, even tortures her and doesn't seem to sense her latent abilities. Luke, despite very brief training on the flight to Alderaan, is quickly identified by Vader as being strong, even when he is just another pilot in the battle over the Death Star. I think Yoda and Obi-Wan view Leia as a backup, to be used if Luke failed, and that to keep her parentage secret from her, Vader and the Emperor was the best way to keep her safe.  <sep>  Q: Why didn't Yoda train Princess Leia as a Jedi?
