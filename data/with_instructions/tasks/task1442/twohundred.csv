input: CONTEXT: Spider-Man: Homecoming is following the Captain America: Civil War. I've seen the same trailer - and the clip with Spidey holding Cap's shield seems to be lifted straight from the CA:CW movie during the airport fight.

input: CONTEXT: The balance of power had shifted considerably since the first set of quotes. King Joffrey is dead, and his younger brother Tommen is now king. Unlike his wild card of an elder brother, Tommen is gentler and more prone to manipulation by his new bride. The Lannisters impeccable image has also been shattered. They failed to prevent the assassination of their king in the midst of his own wedding day, and the suspected assassin is the king's Lannister uncle. Not only do they look incompetent, they are divided among themselves. On the other hand, the Tyrells' situation is much stronger now. Tommen is already wrapped around Margaery's pretty little finger, and she knows that the assassination was orchestrated in part by her own family. In Margaery's eyes, the Lannisters look disoriented and lost. Putting on a show trial for one of their own, whom she knows is innocent of any wrongdoing. Whatever power Cersei held over Margaery has now been diminished.  <sep>  Q: What was Margaery's motivation to call Cersei 'sister' again?

input: CONTEXT: The plot by MI 6 and the CIA is to give Le Chiffre no choice but to turn himself in. They had no legal right to arrest him, lack of evidence and all. Once he lost the money, both organizations hoped the pressure by the real criminal contacts would force Chiffre to turn evidence over, instead of being killed. Both organizations are playing a long game in this. There was no expected immediate payout in the plan. If they arrest him, they would reveal their hand in the events and blow the operation. Additionally, Leiter was playing this by ear. The only reason the CIA could arrange this was because MI-6 decided it got too expensive and Bond was willing to work with them. It was a field decision that wasn't part of the actual CIA plan (Leiter was expected to win).  <sep>  Q: Why didn't Felix Leiter catch Le Chiffre after the game was done?

input: CONTEXT: In the books it is yet to be discovered if he is brought back to life for what greater purpose. But one thing is for sure, it isn't just one thing he did, but many. Probably in the books he is the one who kills the Night King, because it was clear from David Benioff's interview that they wanted to subvert expectations, they wanted someone who was not Jon to kill the Night King. So I think in the books he came back to life for also killing the NK. He was brought back to do a lot of things if you start to see it that way, a chain of events that led to a lot of things. Defeated Ramsay, showed the World that the dead are coming, prepared for the Long Night and battle of Winterfell. Successfully defeating NK would not have been possible without him. What the Lord of Light could have wanted? Well, we don't even know what LoL was, didn't know what his intentions were, who were his enemy but one thing we know for sure, all victories inevitably came at a cost.

input: CONTEXT: A Song of Ice and Fire really sounds quite fantasy-ish, whereas Game of Thrones sounds medieval and more suitable for a show. Also, the name 'Game of Thrones' gives more information about what will happen in the TV series (politics and fight for the throne) than the name A song of ice and fire does.

A Song of Ice and Fire is sophisticated and poetic, but Game of Thrones is direct and exciting and very easily remembered. And that's what counts for the average person. Note also that the phrase is used in the other books and is perhaps even better than the series title at describing in one phrase the whole point of the books.  <sep>  Q: Why is the TV show titled ""Game of Thrones"" and not ""A Song of Ice and Fire?"" A: A Song of Ice and Fire really sounds quite fantasy-ish, whereas Game of Thrones sounds medieval and more suitable for a show  Q: True, but the book series is called ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" don't you think that would attract more people who were fans of the book?

Quite a few Native American tribes used this kind of fishing technique to catch freshwater fish.

input: CONTEXT: I think it's deliberately ambiguous. If it's real, the inconsistencies are easily explained by Vidal's fascist belief system. These elements simply are not part of his world. If it's fantasy, then of course only Ofelia can see these thing because she imagined them. I think part of Del Toro's purpose in the film was to maintain the plausibility of both of these interpretations. <sep> Q: Is Ofelia just dreaming things to get herself in a fairy world? A: If it's fantasy, then of course only Ofelia can see these thing because she imagined them  Q: Are the things happening for real but visible only to Ofelia?

input: CONTEXT: Spider-Man: Homecoming is following the Captain America: Civil War. I've seen the same trailer - and the clip with Spidey holding Cap's shield seems to be lifted straight from the CA:CW movie during the airport fight.

input: CONTEXT: As we see in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (during the climactic fight between Darth Maul, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi) and Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (when dozens of Jedi storm the arena where Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala have been sentenced to death), Jedi have no qualms about killing those that are trying to kill them. In fact, we see that Obi-Wan Kenobi is referred to as General Kenobi in Star Wars films set after the events of the Clone Wars, so we can be reasonably sure that there is nothing prohibiting Jedi killing people in battle. However, at the point you are asking about in Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, Count Dooku is an unarmed opponent and poses little to no further threat. The Jedi way would have been to arrest him, not murder him, as Anakin himself correctly says in the quote in the question.  <sep>  Q: In Star Wars, can a Jedi kill? A: Jedi have no qualms about killing those that are trying to kill them  Q: Is it a plot device? A: Obi-Wan Kenobi is referred to as General Kenobi in Star Wars films set after the events of the Clone Wars, so we can be reasonably sure that there is nothing prohibiting Jedi killing people in battle  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Who is killed in the first movie?

input: CONTEXT: I'm afraid you completely misunderstood a lot of the movie. At the start of the movie, Hal is already dead (killed himself in prison). Those scenes with Hal (mostly in New York) were all flashbacks. The present is with sister in San Francisco. Jasmine meets Dwight at a party in San Francisco. This is long after Hal killed himself. But to your question: ""Why did Jasmine arrest Hal?"" It was purely a spur of the moment, revenge thing. Hal had just told Jasmine that he was in love with this French girl and was going to leave her. And almost immediately, Jasmine calls the FBI (or rather calls someone to get the FBI's number).  <sep>  Q: Why did Jasmine arrest Hal?

input: CONTEXT: Maybe it's because with origami you can go from a simple non living material such as a simple sheet of paper and mold it into something that is a representation of a living thing. Although this might never get a true answer I like to think it has something to do with the artificial creation of something representing life or dreams. When thinking further along these lines it strikes me that indeed the origami are all artificial representations of something living, yet a unicorn can never be really alive which can then be some sort of an origami analogy for Deckard = Replicant.  <sep>  Q: What does the origami represent in Blade Runner?

Francesca knows how people, especially women are treated in that town if adultery is whispered about. The film shows how Lucy Delaney is treated by the people in town over gossip about her committing adultery with a married man. Francesca's husband is well respected in that town. She loves her husband and children too much to ruin them in that town with gossip. That's why she acts as if she doesn't really know or care about Robert.  <sep>  Q: Is she lying on the phone?

input: CONTEXT: There was no movie rating system in place back in the 1940's, and movies were greatly censored by the US government. In the 1920's the Supreme Court ruled that free speech did not apply to movies, and a control board was arranged where by all film studios had to submit their scripts for censorship. Movie studios were given guide lines by which they had to follow. So it's not so much that profanity is now widespread, as much as it was strictly forbidden back in the 1940's. This system of governed film making slowly started to collapse over the years and gave birth to the Motion Picture film rating system. Where the film ratings and censorship is controlled by the film industry and not by a single controlling person or government. Now that we have the rating system, films can be classified by their rating. Today's ratings are, at least by idea, implemented by our peers. So as society changes so do those who review and rate films. That is why we see more profanity in PG rated films, as parents who rate the films accept the fact that children in this age group use these profane words or acknowledge that the film works the way the script was written. New ratings were introduced including PG-13. To address the need for films that target a segment of the population that are pre-adult but seek adult style films. Still, I have to wonder who these people are that rate these films.  <sep>  Q: Era of profanity in movie scripts?

input: CONTEXT: He wants to destroy the symbol of the revolution. Think back to the end of the first film. Katniss saves Peeta's life by threatening to eat the poisonous berries, and thus kill them both. In doing so she forces the government's hand, making Snow look weak. Katniss then has to pretend to love Peeta, and this love is shown to the public. Snow even taunts her with it, knowing the love is false. But he doesn't reveal it publicly, because he knows he can use it against her. Katniss then becomes the face of the revolution. By showing Peeta switching sides, and by having him be the one to kill Katniss, Snow will regain his lost power. He will once again appear to be the man in charge. Part of this comes from the Quarter Quell, where Katniss (to the public at least) apparently abandons Peeta. It's also a massive personal and demoralising blow against Katniss. Even if Peeta fails, Snow hopes to break Katniss' spirit, and in doing so destroy her, and the revolution with it. He fails, because he doesn't count on Katniss actually coming to love Peeta.  <sep>  Q: Which rescue team saves them?

input: CONTEXT: He wants to destroy the symbol of the revolution. Think back to the end of the first film. Katniss saves Peeta's life by threatening to eat the poisonous berries, and thus kill them both. In doing so she forces the government's hand, making Snow look weak. Katniss then has to pretend to love Peeta, and this love is shown to the public. Snow even taunts her with it, knowing the love is false. But he doesn't reveal it publicly, because he knows he can use it against her. Katniss then becomes the face of the revolution. By showing Peeta switching sides, and by having him be the one to kill Katniss, Snow will regain his lost power. He will once again appear to be the man in charge. Part of this comes from the Quarter Quell, where Katniss (to the public at least) apparently abandons Peeta. It's also a massive personal and demoralising blow against Katniss. Even if Peeta fails, Snow hopes to break Katniss' spirit, and in doing so destroy her, and the revolution with it. He fails, because he doesn't count on Katniss actually coming to love Peeta.  <sep>  Q: Which rescue team saves them?

input: CONTEXT: Mike has not spent a dime of Fring's drug money, which is revealed when he is first interrogated by the DEA.

Technically this might be a conflict of interest, but these are not moral, law-abiding citizens. Additionally, working for Goodman allows Mike to keep an eye on Walt and Jesse, who are very much part of Fring's interests. This would explain why Gus would allow Mike to work for Goodman.

input: CONTEXT: For a perfect clone, down to the quantum level, both would be the real Angier. That is the essence of his fear. The real Angier will be killed every time. When you download a movie what you are doing is actually making a perfect copy of the movie. Which is the real movie? They all are. This is very different from making copies of film reels where only the original have the quality of the original (each copy adds a little imperfection). Now, the question The Prestige asks is what if you can make a perfect clone of a person the way you can perfectly copy digital data? In one sense, if we don't want to get too uncomfortable we can always say the remaining copy is now the real data and the deleted copy is not real anymore. But if you really think about it and get out of your comfort zone you will realize that both people are real and what you have done is murdered yourself. In The Prestige this point is much more clearly made as the old copied Angier becomes the one who is killed. Not the newly created clone. Every time the clone will have only the memory of the surviving Angier. But every time Angier experiences death, only the Angier that experienced death has no way of passing that memory to the surviving Angier so the survivor can never know what dying feels like.  <sep>  Q: How does it work that the clones are sentient paradox?

input: CONTEXT: The film depends heavily on the events of X-Men 3: The Last Stand. In that film, Wolverine does something he regrets heavily, and it is the basis for his character arc in The Wolverine. So to fully appreciate this film, you should watch X-Men 3. But to fully appreciate X-Men 3, you should see X-Men and X-Men 2, since it's a sequel to those, and a continuation of those stories. You can skip X-Men: First Class, as it has no bearing on The Wolverine. And you should skip X-Men Origins: Wolverine for the many reasons critics described back when it was released (it also doesn't have much bearing on The Wolverine). Alternatively, if you're familiar with the X-Men from the comics, and are aware of some of the key storylines that occurred there, you can read this spoiler to get up to speed: In X-Men 3, Jean Grey is taken over by the Phoenix. She goes on a rampage, allies with Magneto and begins a mutant vs. human war. Wolverine is forced to kill her because she's completely out of control.  <sep>  Q: Can The Wolverine be viewed as a stand-alone film? A: to fully appreciate X-Men 3, you should see X-Men and X-Men 2, since it's a sequel to those, and a continuation of those stories  Q: Will I miss anything if I skip the first movie?

The reason Barry is returned so soon is that his abduction corresponds close in time with that final interaction.

input: CONTEXT: I think it was worded that way for pragmatic reasons. Peter Jackson didn't want to tell the story of Sméagol until after the character Gollum was established. In The Fellowship of the Ring, the viewer is intended to see Gollum as a sort of beast. In The Two Towers, he has a much larger role and seems sort of halfway between beast and person, but a viewer who has not read the books is still unlikely to guess that he is a corrupted hobbit. The Return of the King opens with the story of Sméagol and Déagol to shed new light on who Gollum is, where he came from, why the Ring means so much to him, and what kind of influence the Ring wields over him. It is a bit of a shocking scene; the shock would not be nearly as strong if the viewer already knew Gollum's origin. So, in the opening of The Fellowship of the Ring, that Gollum was once a hobbit named Sméagol is an extraneous detail. While ""the Ring came to Gollum"" is an oversimplification, it was a necessary one; it told the viewer what he needed to know at that point in the story and no more.  <sep>  Q: Why does the narrator say 'The ring came to the creature Gollum'?

Toby's role as a HR employee would primarily be protecting Dunder Mifflin from Michael's stupidity. Michael Scott is, by design, an absolute idiot of a character. He's totally incompetent as a manager and also has absolutely no understanding of what is and isn't appropriate for the workplace, especially when occupying a managerial position. Toby would be the one who calls him up on his inappropriate conduct, reports that conduct back to corporate, and who would be responsible for telling Michael ""no"" before he does things that he shouldn't. Children will occasionally tell their parents that they hate them (or at least don't love them) when they've been denied something they want or have been told off for doing something they shouldn't. Michael's essentially having a childish - and ongoing - reaction against the authority figure who denies him the things he wants.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: It seems to be mostly due to the convenience of the channel or network airing a series with a number of pre-recorded episodes or at least a batch of them. For example, when a network buys or syndicates a series that has, let's say, 10 episodes and start airing the episodes in december, if they air episodes 1 and 2 but the christmas episode of the series is the number 10, they will air the 10th episode as the 3rd one to coincide wih the holidays. Other scenario is when something happens in the real world and the series has an episode that deals with a similar theme. Take as an example the shootings that happened in France recently. Some networks will alter the airing order of episodes in a series to avoid a similar subject to avoid the sensationalism, other may try to cash on it and air sooner an episode that dealed with something similar. Also, a network can try to get people into watching their series and getting high ratings, airing the ""best"" episodes of a series first (i.e. the ones with the more action, or drama, or sex, etc.). Then, when the series go to DVD the numbering order is usually the scripted order and not the airing one, that's why both differ.  <sep>  Q: What is the reason that the air order and the DVD order of a tv show is different?

input: CONTEXT: It seems to be mostly due to the convenience of the channel or network airing a series with a number of pre-recorded episodes or at least a batch of them. For example, when a network buys or syndicates a series that has, let's say, 10 episodes and start airing the episodes in december, if they air episodes 1 and 2 but the christmas episode of the series is the number 10, they will air the 10th episode as the 3rd one to coincide wih the holidays. Other scenario is when something happens in the real world and the series has an episode that deals with a similar theme. Take as an example the shootings that happened in France recently. Some networks will alter the airing order of episodes in a series to avoid a similar subject to avoid the sensationalism, other may try to cash on it and air sooner an episode that dealed with something similar. Also, a network can try to get people into watching their series and getting high ratings, airing the ""best"" episodes of a series first (i.e. the ones with the more action, or drama, or sex, etc.). Then, when the series go to DVD the numbering order is usually the scripted order and not the airing one, that's why both differ.  <sep>  Q: What is the reason that the air order and the DVD order of a tv show is different?

input: CONTEXT: I think it's deliberately ambiguous. If it's real, the inconsistencies are easily explained by Vidal's fascist belief system. These elements simply are not part of his world.

input: CONTEXT: My theory is yes, it is so easy to become vice president of Dunder Mifflin. That's most likely why they were bought out by Sabre, its because all of the guys in the New York branch were all idiots and had no clue what they were doing and didn't care, most likely because its a paper company, and who cares about paper!?  <sep>  Q: Was it that easy to become a vice President at Dunder Mifflin?

input: CONTEXT: No, this was never released on film. The The New York Public Library's Theatre on Film and Tape Archive records most theater productions for archival purposes, but only makes them available to qualified researchers. Typically, if you are deemed qualified you will receive a copy of the production with a very large watermark running across the video. You would then submit the timestamps of the sections you wish to use, restricted to some varying short amount of time, and then you would be provided with only those segments on a disc without the watermark. Many major filmhouses do this as well. There's a very famous one whose name escapes me at the moment which deals with live concert footage, they were the first ones known to have the Rush show from Capital Theater in 1976 (which has since been officially released by Rush) as well as a Boston concert from 1979, among a large selection of others.  <sep>  Q: was waiting for godet released on film?
