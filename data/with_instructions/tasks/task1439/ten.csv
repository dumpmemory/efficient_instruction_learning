The only thing to keep in mind is that duck feet, like any other duck parts, are substantially more fatty than their chicken equivalents, so assuming you want a clear or mostly-clear stock, you'll have to spend a lot of time skimming.Alternatively you can clean the feet and other bones by boiling them in plain water for 5-10 minutes, then dumping it all out and starting over - which is what your linked recipe suggests. I don't usually do this for brown stocks because you lose a lot of flavour, but if you're starting from raw then it won't make much difference and it's an easy/lazy way to get rid of a lot of the fat at once. <sep> Q: Can I use duck feet to make duck stock A: The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet  Q: Does it add the same flavor and mouth feel?

input: CONTEXT: Simple: grate it. If you grate the nutmeg using a microplane, it should have a strong, distinctive odor you can smell from a couple feet away. If it doesn't, it's lost its flavor, throw it away and buy new. It's fairly likely you're going to end up replacing it. I've never seen nutmegs get moldy before, and I live somewhere with 80% humidity. It would have to be stored in some very poor conditions to mold. <sep>  Q: How to distinguish nutmeg freshness?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I always submerged mine in warm water and, bare handed, worked the cap until it came free. The water should dissolve the salt with the help of the mechanical action. That was with glass bottoms and metal tops. You should be able to brute force your full metal shaker with no ill effect as the metal will have a much higher shear strength than the salt that is binding it.  <sep>  Q: have you untwist a salt shaker before? A: I always submerged mine in warm water and, bare handed, worked the cap until it came free  Q: I can try that but is there a better way? A: The water should dissolve the salt with the help of the mechanical action  Q: Hmm, would it be a good idea to use pliers to pry it open? A: You should be able to brute force your full metal shaker with no ill effect as the metal will have a much higher shear strength than the salt that is binding it  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: that's a good explanation.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I make bacon and other cured meats frequently. I find that the amount of liquid released from pork belly varies. That is not a useful measure of how the cure is proceeding. Bacon, in particular, is usually cooked after the cure, so I don't worry too much. I use the salt-box method, coat the belly in cure mixture, place in large zip lock, place in container slightly larger than belly and put in fridge. Flip every day or so for a week. What I look for next is a firming up of the belly. I pinch it. If it has firmed up after a week, I move on to hot smoking (or you could use your oven). If it still feels soft, I give it another day or two.  <sep>  Q: How much juice should come out when I'm curing pork belly? A: I find that the amount of liquid released from pork belly varies  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: My latest batch has extracted less than half of the juice of the first two. Is this normal?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Traditionally, mozzarella is sold extremely fresh - as in made that day or the day before. If it's held for more than a day or so, it comes packaged in a brine. Most of the American stuff is just too soft to be held for packaging like other shredded cheese in the mega-mart.In the US, being extreme gluttons for convenience, we tend to make do with part-skim shredded mozzarella instead of the good stuff. Slight temperature variations can make the shreds stick together in a globby mass. It's harmless from a safety point of view, and the expiry date can be long after the occurrence of perfectly safe globbiness.Pro-Tip: Put the globby pieces in the freezer for 20 minutes, and then shred it like a block of harder cheese. Upon heating, it will melt (almost) as if the the globbiness had never happened. I have taken advantage of a few good sales that way. Mozzarella will become... ehem... colorful before it becomes unsafe. While this answer is more for mozzerella than for other types of cheese; the last paragraph works for any mega-mart shredded cheese.  <sep>  Q: Why would unopened shredded cheese get soggy in the fridge?

A: It's harmless from a safety point of view, and the expiry date can be long after the occurrence of perfectly safe globbiness  Q: How can I prevent this from happening?

input: CONTEXT: Duck feet will render plenty of gelatin because of the amount of cartilage, same as chicken feet. Any bird's feet are a good choice.The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet. The only thing to keep in mind is that duck feet, like any other duck parts, are substantially more fatty than their chicken equivalents, so assuming you want a clear or mostly-clear stock, you'll have to spend a lot of time skimming.Alternatively you can clean the feet and other bones by boiling them in plain water for 5-10 minutes, then dumping it all out and starting over - which is what your linked recipe suggests. I don't usually do this for brown stocks because you lose a lot of flavour, but if you're starting from raw then it won't make much difference and it's an easy/lazy way to get rid of a lot of the fat at once. <sep> Q: Can I use duck feet to make duck stock A: The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet  Q: Does it add the same flavor and mouth feel? A: The only thing to keep in mind is that duck feet, like any other duck parts, are substantially more fatty than their chicken equivalents  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: How does this change things?
output: Yes

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I've never used bhut jolokias but I love spicy vegetable oil. DO NOT just throw the peppers in a jar of oil. Apparently this is bad. Follow the much more helpful links in the comments that follow this and make the oil properly.Once you do this you can cook pretty much anything that needs a little (or a lot) of extra heat. You said you have other peppers so it might be interesting to set up a few jars with different pepper combos.Bonus: if what I've heard of these peppers is correct, you can probably make a low grade mace this way.If you're looking for something to do right away, I'd mix a very small piece in some melty cheese and throw it on some chips, burritos, pizza, or anything really. Spicy cheese rocks.Good luck and enjoy.  <sep>  Q: What can I do with Bhut Jolokia's?
output: ",Yes
