input: CONTEXT: I don't think you can any better than light brown soft sugar!It has a similar taste, similar moisture content (though palm sugar varies hugely in moisture content from a thick honey texture to a solid block), similar color and caramelizes in a similar way.An ever closer option is jaggery, which is almost identical to palm sugar, just made from sugar cane rather than palms. It is probably more difficult to get hold of though, and the difference is rarely noticeable in a finished dish, so I would say light brown sugar is your best option  <sep>  Q: What can I substitute for palm sugar?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I'd say freeze nearly all of them uncooked and bake when ready. That way they go through only one cooking and maintain the fresh lasagna taste/feel.The sauce and and the cheese will freeze ok. Mozzarella is a pretty sensitive cheese and once it's been baked, it's not going to hold as well when thawed and re-warmed. In my experience it gets gummy and the fat runs off. You have much better chance of enjoying a good meal with the cheese frozen raw.Unfortunately, your noodles will likely take the hardest hit, but will likely fare better than going through two heat cycles.The ground beef and sausage will also fare better that way.The reason I suggested freezing MOST and not all, is that there are times when you're behind the 8-ball, hungry, and don't have the time to bake the sucker, and even ponder settling for dog-food. At that point having a silver bullet in the freezer is a bonus ;) and you'll be ok with inferior lasagna.  <sep>  Q: Should homemade lasagna be frozen cooked or uncooked?

input: CONTEXT: Shortbread ships well, especially if you make the individual biscuits fairly thick. Walker's should be your guide here: theirs are about 0.75 to 1cm thick, which helps prevent crumbling in transit. Shipping them in a tin is also advised.Shortbread is also fairly shelf-stable.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: First off, the ISO standard is not intended to produce a good cup of tea. It is designed to produce a consistent one for taste testing, so that no tea manufacturer can claim that his tea wasn't made ""properly"".It's title is ""Tea -- Preparation of liquor for use in sensory tests""As for the actual tea making, yes, leaving the bag in longer will make a stronger cup of tea. The concentration of caffeine (along with flavour molecules and everything else) will slowly trend towards an equal concentration in the leaf and in the water. The longer you leave the tea bag/leaves in the water, the closer to equilibrium you will get.There are other factors that affect this, such as the temperature of the water, cut of the leaves, bag versus loose leaf and so on, but the trend is always towards equilibrium as time progresses.I'm not sure where the upper limit of this lies, but I think that once the cup is cold there's no point in it anyway. Thus, leaving the bag in for an hour is a bit much. I usually steep my tea for 3-6 minutes, depending on how strong I want it to be.  <sep>  Q: Does brewing tea for longer result in higher caffeine content? A: leaving the bag in longer will make a stronger cup of tea  Q: How much?

input: CONTEXT: I'm not sure I've ever seen chipotle paste called for in recipes; I searched around a bit and what I found was consistent with my experience. I saw chipotle en adobo, ground chipotle, and even whole dried chipotle. I also easily found recipes for chipotle en adobo. I don't think you'll have any trouble figuring out what to do with them.The most common way I've seen chipotles, both in grocery stores and in recipes, is chipotle en adobo. You can make your own by simmering dried chipotles in tomato paste with vinegar, garlic, onion (search for recipes if that's not specific enough). I suspect that most chipotle pastes you might find are something like this, but pureed, and possibly cooked until thicker.The other common way to use chipotles is as a powder; that's as easy as grinding them in a spice grinder. If you're using them in something that gets cooked for a decent amount of time, I'd just do this and add them, instead of making chipotle en adobo or a paste out of them.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Chocolate is an odd substance when it comes to melting and hardening. When chocolate hardens, its melting point will end up being just a few degrees higher than the hardening temperature.When chocolate crystallizes at high temperatures, it forms a strong, dense crystalline structure that, texture-wise, is quite brittle. Most bought chocolate (baker's chocolate and chips) is already tempered, but when you melt it, you break down that crystalline structure, and if you harden it at room temperature then it ends up forming very weak crystals that will melt in your hand.If you use a special coating chocolate (couverture or the lower-quality compound chocolate) then you don't need to worry so much about tempering (although it's still a good idea), but if you use ordinary chocolate and don't temper it then your coating will end up being messy and wet and rub off on your hands while you eat it. It might even melt while stored.Tempering is the key to making a room-temperature-stable chocolate coating. If you don't do this, you'll need to keep your pastries refrigerated until they're ready to consume.  <sep>  Q: What is the purpose of tempering chocolate? A: Tempering is the key to making a room-temperature-stable chocolate coating  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Can I just melt chocolate rather than tempering?

input: CONTEXT: Almost any normal sorbet recipe will contain a decent amount of sugar, and strawberries are no exception. I'd guess probably 1/2-2/3 cup per pound of strawberries. Use a substitute if you have an aversion - honey, agave, raw cane sugar, whatever you prefer. (Of course, anything liquid is going to contain some water, and cause a bit of ice, but it's still doable.) A sorbet without any extra sugar, even when frozen normally in an ice cream maker, is going to end up with a very icy texture, which will probably keep you from experiencing the flavor as much. The sugar helps soften it.The other common way to soften a sorbet is alcohol. RosÃ© wine (thank you, David Lebovitz) works quite well in a strawberry sorbet. Vodka can be your go-to liquor for any impromptu sorbet with other fruits, since it'll add alcohol without any flavors that clash. Beyond that, either look for recipes, or look for mixed drinks containing the fruit you're using.You might also be having problems simply because your strawberries aren't that great. Did you freeze them, or were they storebought? If you bought the strawberries yourself, you'd know they were decent before freezing, while not all storebought frozen fruit is as flavorful.Finally, it's possible that your frozen strawberries collected some extra water in the form of frost, which then makes your sorbet icier. If there are obvious big chunks you could scrape them off.  <sep>  Q: How can I improve flavor of Sorbet made in Magic Bullet?

input: CONTEXT: Yes, you can roast the beans some more. However the results will probably not be great. Roasting results in quite a bit of smoke. If you are going low tech, I would do it in a wok in a very well ventilated area. It's pretty easy to set off smoke detectors. A stove top with a range hood might be good enough if you have a particularly good range hood. Outside with the wok on a BBQ is probably best.Roast over a low heat and stir continuously. You want to get the beans as even as possible, trying not to burn them. The beans will continue to roast after taking them off the heat. So stop one or two roast levels before the desired colour and tip your beans out into a colander and continue stirring to cool. The residual heat will cook the bean some more. To aim for a desired roast level, compare the current roast colour to your desired roast colour and maybe to a roast level chart. Google image search ""coffee roast level chart"". Guesstimate the roast level that is one or two levels below your desired colour to stop at.Once again there will be a lot of smoke.  <sep>  Q: How to improve the taste of sour coffee beans?

input: CONTEXT: I recently found a different sauce that had a similar butterscotch note to it. It turned out this one was a very simple pan sauce built with brandy and beef stock as a deglazing liquid which was allowed to reduce by about 2/3 and then it was finished with a hint of cream.The fond came from a steak cooked in butter so there was probably a little browned butter in there as well.At this point I think the reduced brandy is a big contributor to the flavor I was identifying as butterscotch.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The primary reason is definitely convenience. If you don't want skin and seeds in your sauce, then you have to do some work to avoid it. Yes, it's possible, e.g. passing through a food mill, or blanching and peeling plus retaining only the flesh, but having it already done is a whole lot easier.Passata is usually much thicker too, so it won't need as long a cooking time to reduce into a non-watery sauce as fresh tomatoes. On top of that, you don't have to worry about whether you can find good fresh tomatoes, e.g. if it's winter and they're out of season.Your two cases for comparison seem to overlook this: if you just chop and cook, you'll have skin and seeds in your sauce, as well as excess liquid to cook down, while if you use passata, you won't. (Also, for what it's worth, you'd need pretty giant tomatoes to get the equivalent of 3/4 cup of passata out of one tomato.)Of course, if you don't mind skin and seeds, it's also perfectly fine to simply cook fresh tomatoes and be done with it.Note that you can often get similar advantages from other canned tomato products. In the US, crushed tomatoes are far more common, and a roughly similar texture. (Peeled whole tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste can also be useful depending on what texture you're aiming for.)  <sep>  Q: Why specifically use Passata, rather than tomatoes, in Ragu?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I don't think this has a single answer: The amount of alcohol would depend on the alcohol content of the soaking liquor or liqueur, soaking time, temperature of chocolate, and how thick the strawberry was. I suspect uncut strawberries would take at least several days to fully absorb alcohol and reach equilibrium, but the surface should take up alcohol fairly quickly. If they are cut up, exposing the more porous interior, I imagine an overnight soak would be sufficient to reach maximum alcohol content. The enormous, bloated mutant strawberries you sometimes see at stores could take considerably longer than others to absorb their maximum alcohol. Alcohol is much more volatile than water, so the immersion in warm, melted chocolate would remove some alcohol, but once the chocolate cools, it should trap any remaining content.The flavor of alcohol is easily masked by other flavors at under 20% content; this could explain why your friend didn't taste it, but you did. It's quite possible the strawberries packed a sobriety-busting punch, but it was disguised by the chocolate and fruit tastes.  <sep>  Q: How much alcohol remains in strawberries soaked in alcohol?

input: CONTEXT: The professional (read: industrial) solution would be maltodextrin powder. It is rather tasteless, has good solubility in liquids, and doesn't change much texturewise. In homemade spice mixes, the popular filler solution are dried breadcrumbs of a very small size (like breadcrumbs for schnitzel breading). They are noticeable, because the mix gets gritty, but the consensus among those who do it is that this is a feature, not a bug. They could also slightly thicken a wet dish (soup, stew), but present no problem when strewn over dry food. You can also use a nut flour made of nuts without much of an own taste, like apricot kernels or low quality overdried almonds. Again, this will be somewhat gritty, but not as hard as the breadcrumn solution.  <sep>  Q: Hello, I am trying to find an extender/filter for my spice mix. Any recommendations?

input: CONTEXT: If the yeast isn't out of date then the most likely sounding culprit is the temperature of your water. It should be between 105-110. If it's too cool then you won't activate the yeast and if you get it too warm you'll start to kill it.Another possible case can be when you're adding the salt. If it's going in before or at the same time as the sugar you will arrest the gas production and activity of the yeast.Get the yeast, sugar, water mixture going first and create a shaggy dough with your flour. Add the salt as you're starting to bring the dough together so that it doesn't act too quickly to arrest the yeast development.If you keep your flour in the freezer or refrigerator, make sure it has come to room temperature before adding it to the water or the chill of the flour will de-activate the yeast.  <sep>  Q: How do I get my pizza dough to rise?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Fat doesn't spoil like other foods. No bacteria can live in fat. Going rancid is a chemical reaction in which the fat molecules break down. So ""leaving out"" is not a problem. The major factors in going rancid are light and air. The more light hits your fat, the sooner it goes rancid. Also, rancidity occurs when the fat is oxidized, meaning that if you prevent contact with air, your fat will last longer. Both factors are minimized by transferring the fat to a tightly closed opaque container. With liquid oils, you use a dark colored bottle. As bottles are impractical for solid fat, just strain your grease into a jar, close it, and put it in a cupboard. The shelf life should be many months, probably more than a year. Also, don't worry that you can get something nasty when the grease goes bad unnoticed. Rancid fat isn't a big safety risk, and ingesting it in small amounts is not problematic. If it stinks, throw it out. Before that, there is no problem eating it. The above assumes pure, well-strained fat. Pieces of fried meat left over in the fat are a safety risk, even tiny ones.  <sep>  Q: How long does grease take to go bad/rancid when sitting out? A: The more light hits your fat, the sooner it goes rancid  Q: If I make a skillet full of bacon, how long can I leave the grease sitting out before it is unsafe/rancid? A: if you prevent contact with air, your fat will last longer  Q: How long do you think that it's still safe to use? A: If it stinks, throw it out. Before that, there is no problem eating it  Q: Should I store it in the refrigerator or leave it out? A: just strain your grease into a jar, close it, and put it in a cupboard  Q: Is the answer different for ground beef grease? A: The shelf life should be many months, probably more than a year  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Is there anything else I should know about storing leftover grease?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The term is not really defined that way. In the strict sense, it only has meaning for lean doughs - made of only flour, water, yeast and salt, eventually preferments or later mixins like seeds. You can extend it to enriched doughs (those that have fat, milk, eggs, tomato juice, etc.) but then it is no longer sharply defined. Calculating the exact content of water (e.g. adding to the calculation 17 g of water for every 100 g of butter) are pretty useless, because the water bound in an emulsion or other kind of colloid doesn't behave the same way as free water when making a dough. So, a dough with 100 g water and 100 g butter will be extremely different from a dough with 117 g of water, and still pretty different from one with 117 g of water and 83 g of oil. So, there is no real formula any more to create an actual percentage. The concept still stays somewhat useful in this case, but you have to ""play it by ear"". When you are trying to judge how soft a given enriched dough will be, you can start by calculating all the liquid and fat ingredients as if they were ""hydration"", which gives you a rough guide to compare it to other doughs, and then you have to make it and gain a tactile understanding of how it actually behaves.  <sep>  Q: What counts as ""hydration"" when figuring Dough Hydration? A: The term is not really defined that way. In the strict sense, it only has meaning for lean doughs - made of only flour, water, yeast and salt  Q: do we count things like sour cream, butter, milk, eggs?

input: CONTEXT: I'm not sure I've ever seen chipotle paste called for in recipes; I searched around a bit and what I found was consistent with my experience. I saw chipotle en adobo, ground chipotle, and even whole dried chipotle. I also easily found recipes for chipotle en adobo. I don't think you'll have any trouble figuring out what to do with them.The most common way I've seen chipotles, both in grocery stores and in recipes, is chipotle en adobo. You can make your own by simmering dried chipotles in tomato paste with vinegar, garlic, onion (search for recipes if that's not specific enough). I suspect that most chipotle pastes you might find are something like this, but pureed, and possibly cooked until thicker.The other common way to use chipotles is as a powder; that's as easy as grinding them in a spice grinder. If you're using them in something that gets cooked for a decent amount of time, I'd just do this and add them, instead of making chipotle en adobo or a paste out of them. Just think of them as a spice.  <sep>  Q: I see lots of recipes using chili paste. Can I use dry ones instead, like in a sauce?

Any bird's feet are a good choice.The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet. The only thing to keep in mind is that duck feet, like any other duck parts, are substantially more fatty than their chicken equivalents, so assuming you want a clear or mostly-clear stock, you'll have to spend a lot of time skimming.Alternatively you can clean the feet and other bones by boiling them in plain water for 5-10 minutes, then dumping it all out and starting over - which is what your linked recipe suggests. I don't usually do this for brown stocks because you lose a lot of flavour, but if you're starting from raw then it won't make much difference and it's an easy/lazy way to get rid of a lot of the fat at once. <sep> Q: Can I use duck feet to make duck stock A: The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet  Q: Does it add the same flavor and mouth feel?

They may have slightly different viscosities and water content, but that could be true between two honeys as well, so I wouldn't worry about it a lot. The only thing I think you really have to consider is whether the flavor of maple syrup is appealing in the dish you would substitute it in.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: For bacterial spoilage, keeping the soup hot would be more effective. As for ""preserving"" the soup, refrigeration will be drastically more effective. The high temperatures of simmering would keep the bacterial level pretty much nil, but the constant heat will ruin your soup on it's own. Anything in the soup will become mush, flavors will become over-concentrated, and some flavors can drastically change from prolonged exposure to such heat.Prompt chilling and cold storage after cooking will greatly slow down the rate at which bacteria can repopulate the soup, and will also keep everything else in the soup about the way it was when the soup was at it's prime. To really keep textures nice, I'd recommend pulling off the soup that will be stored while vegetables & meat are still a little firmer than you'd like so that they'll finish when you reheat.  <sep>  Q: Is continuously simmering or refrigerating cooked soup a more effective way to prevent spoilage? A: For bacterial spoilage, keeping the soup hot would be more effective. As for ""preserving"" the soup, refrigeration will be drastically more effective  Q: Would it be safe to leave it simmering on the stove for so many days?

input: CONTEXT: Topside is quite a tough cut, so I'd tend towards a longer cooking time; as 'low and slow' as possible, really. With other meats, escalopes are usually made using leaner cuts, like chicken breast or pork tenderloin, which would be cooked relatively quickly, so I'm surprised your recipes call for topside.  <sep>  Q: How to properly prepare a beef escalope (from the topside)?

input: CONTEXT: Personally I'd suggest blanching your pasta. By blanching:I mean get a big pan of heavily salted water on a rolling boil. Drop your pasta into the water, give it a stir.After 1 min or when the water has come back to boil drain the pasta off.At this point your pasta will still be el' dante but not raw which is what I suspect the directions are suggesting when they say ""2 min less than instructed"" then just use it at the mixing with sour cream step.If you were to just use the pasta freshly made it will likely not have the texture desired. Boiling it will help moisten it up and start to cook the flour.  <sep>  Q: Using homemade pasta instead of dried in a bake###'d like to use fresh homemade pasta tonight in place of bagged egg noodles. ###My question is, should I prep the noodles in boiling water in anyway, or should I skip that step and add the freshly made noodles where the recipe calls for it?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: As baka has said, more volatile components of the wine will be released with more wine surface exposed.Also, this not only releases aroma but also helps the wine to ""breathe"" and oxidize, which is why you open the red wine bottle half an hour before serving it (so that this process starts), and why you might pour the wine into a decanter.This process accentuates the flavors and aromas of the wine. It is not very much necessary with younger, colder served wines (e.g. vinho verde).In young, sparkling wine, a larger glass will disperse the bubbles faster, as well as warming it. This is undesireable, hence the smaller, narrower glasses.Aged white wine should behave similarly to aged red wine, although it doesn't need to breathe as much.  <sep>  Q: Why are red wine glasses wider than white wine glasses?

input: CONTEXT: Although it doesn't explicitly say so, that's allergy information. It's just been processed in a place that also (potentially) processes those things, so it potentially contains a trace amount, which could be bad if you have a really sensitive allergy. It won't contain enough of those things to matter for any other purpose.Often labels like that are written along the lines of ""processed in a facility which also processes..."" to make it a little more clear. The lists aren't usually that long, either; most facilities don't process everything. But as pointed out in the comments, a grocery store is a lot more likely to just have a single kitchen that possibly handles all kinds of things.  <sep>  Q: Why might packaged pineapple contain egg, soy, peanut, fish, milk, sulphites, tree nuts, sesame, crustaceans, shellfish, mustard seeds, wheat?

Also the type of soy sauce you are using in the first place, You might want to try a Thai or Filipino style soy sauce, different flavor components.

input: CONTEXT: I'm sorry to say this, but I think prevention is the best answer. Once you're vegetables freeze things happen at the cellular level that changes the nature of the vegetables. For example, ice crystals pierce cell walls which destroys some of the structure, which is responsible for the crispness and crunch of the vegetable. I don't think there is really a way to ""fix"" this, once it happens.That said, cooking does something similar to vegetables. Cooking destroys cell walls, which is why cooked carrots are so much softer than raw carrots. I would think that vegetables that stand up to cooking would survive freezing the best (such as your mushrooms). On the other hand, somthing like lettuce is a lost cause, once frozen.  <sep>  Q: How do i recover vegetables that get ""refrigerator crisper chill""?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Water absorption by flour varies by variety, brand, and even batch within brand. For example, I have an American bread book where I quite often have to use far more water than the recipe suggests to achieve the consistency stated. This is down to my British flour apparently absorbing more water.Therefore, it's a good idea to simply use enough flour to get the desired consistency rather than worry too much about being precise. Having said that, when it comes to bread, wetter is better, so only add enough so that you can just work it comfortably.  <sep>  Q: Salt stick dough and shaping, any ideas ?

I can get pretty decent results just hitting it with my cutting board. (with it between saran wrap).Part of it might be technique -- if I'm doing chicken breast I first slice is sort of following the taper of the breast, so it's neither with or across the grain, but kinda of diagonal. You also don't want to hit straight down -- you want to angle the blows, so you're actually pushing the meat out, and not just trying to force it through the counter.And I should mention that I've only ever pounded out poultry and pork -- I assume beef would be the same, but I have no experience to confirm or deny it.  <sep>  Q: If I need to pound chicken, what's the best way to do it that isn't messy?

input: CONTEXT: To make you pancakes spread more, and thus be thinner, increase the amount of liquid in the recipe. This will make the batter less viscous, so that it will spread more before beginning to set, thus giving you thinner pancakes. I would start slowly, perhaps a couple of tablespoons extra milk (or just plain water) until you find the consistency that you like.You will also have to experiment to determine the appropriate cooking time, as the additional liquid will somewhat need to be cooked off to get the best texture.Of course, there is nothing wrong with using the bottom of your ladle to help the batter spread out a bit more.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Mixing it with milk (or liquid in general) is probably just to remove clumps. It clumps easily, especially when things aren't perfectly airtight (probably more common in your grandmother's time), and mixing in a small amount of liquid is an easy way to make sure it all breaks up.I'm less sure about the alternating. It is pretty common to alternate wet and dry as a way of getting things evenly mixed and avoiding lumps, so it's possible it's a variation on that. The paste might be too thick to easily mix into the wet, but also wet enough that it'd tend to stay as a lump if you mix it straight into the dry, so alternating wet-dry-paste might get you more even mixing? But if you're able to mix the paste smoothly into the wet, it's completely fine to just do that.  <sep>  Q: Why pre-mix baking soda into 2 tsp of milk? A: Mixing it with milk (or liquid in general) is probably just to remove clumps  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: reasonably convinced that the purpose of pre-mixing the baking soda (base) into milk (very slightly acid) is to increase the amount of leavening that occurs.

input: CONTEXT: Unfortunately, the above answers would probably be good for fresh tortellini, or frozen or something like that. Following the advice, I had the dried tortellini floating on the surface within a minute or two, puffed a little too. I fished one out, and it was definitely hard. I let them boil for another five minutes and they were barely edible, some even a little crunchy in places.Last week I managed to hunt down the bulk package at the market (used to fill the bin), and there were directions on it: Boiling time: 15-18 minutes.

A lot of hot dog places have traditions - for instance, Nathan's Famous hot dogs (the original ""Coney Island"" hot dog) uses these combinations with kraut:-Sauerkraut, spicey brown mustard (New York style)-Thousand island dressing, sauerkraut, swiss cheese (Reuben style)A famous hot dog maker in Pennsylvania, Yocco's Famous Dogs, uses sauerkraut and a thin bean chili combination to make their hot dogs.The sauerkraut will often be very strong tasting, but not as ""funky"" as kimchi. It pairs well with a lot of different foods, usually other strong flavors (either strong tart like the spicey mustard, or strong sweet like the thousand island dressing or sweet relish).Personally, I just eat sauerkraut with a fork. But if I have it on a dog, I pile it on with dill relish, country style dijon mustard, a dash of sriracha, and some diced onion.

input: CONTEXT: The word you want for research purposes is raitha - there are lots of ideas about how to make raitha.If you want a garlic flavour, the lazy way is to use the garlic paste you can buy in jars. The paste is ground so fine it will avoid the texture problems without any effort.The commonest flavours are mint or chilli, sometimes both together. Those get served with chopped onion, cucumber and tomato - or with papadoms/pappads.I find the most popular dipping versions result from the inclusion of a little mango chutney, Major Grey is good because it has ginger, too.  <sep>  Q: How would I add garlic flavor to yogurt?

input: CONTEXT: Flour is a thickening agent, plain and simple. However adding it without cooking it first can lead to your dish having a raw flour taste, and you can get blobs of flour in it, so I would ignore the recipes which say coat with flour without cooking it first, or use cornstarch (cornflour) instead. Alternatively you can make a roux with flour in a separate pan and add it in later. This is simply mixing equal weights of flour and butter and cooking it in a frying pan until it has the color you want. A lighter roux will add a paler color and a milder flavor, a darker roux adds a deeper color and richer flavor.  <sep>  Q: Have you ever made a ragout?

input: CONTEXT: Absolutely! Metal skewers contribute to cooking the meat from the center as they pick up heat from the exposed parts and conduct it throughout.It is a good idea not to crowd your metal skewers with pieces of food to promote this. Not crowding the skewers also exposes more surface area for the food to caramelize.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I'm not sure about the texture (looseness), especially since those are two different methods. My best guess would be that it's just a flour measurement thing - moisture content in flour can vary, so the best thing to do is look for hints in the recipe about the desired texture (like ""It should tear slightly as it falls from the beater""), and increase or decrease the flour to match.The primary flavors here are salt and chicken, so first just check the amount of salt in both dumplings and broth. For the chicken, you're getting all the flavor out of it by making broth. So make sure you used enough chicken (and not too much water), and that you cooked it long enough. Those recipes use a pressure cooker - if you don't have one, it takes way longer to cook, of course.  <sep>  Q: Looking for Chicken & Dumplings pointers A: The primary flavors here are salt and chicken  Q: Do you know a way of preparing it to make it less bland and loose?

input: CONTEXT: I'd say freeze nearly all of them uncooked and bake when ready. That way they go through only one cooking and maintain the fresh lasagna taste/feel.The sauce and and the cheese will freeze ok. Mozzarella is a pretty sensitive cheese and once it's been baked, it's not going to hold as well when thawed and re-warmed. In my experience it gets gummy and the fat runs off. You have much better chance of enjoying a good meal with the cheese frozen raw.Unfortunately, your noodles will likely take the hardest hit, but will likely fare better than going through two heat cycles.The ground beef and sausage will also fare better that way.The reason I suggested freezing MOST and not all, is that there are times when you're behind the 8-ball, hungry, and don't have the time to bake the sucker, and even ponder settling for dog-food. At that point having a silver bullet in the freezer is a bonus ;) and you'll be ok with inferior lasagna.  <sep>  Q: Should homemade lasagna be frozen cooked or uncooked?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I've never tried steaming bok choy, but yes, the ribs and leafy bits cook at different speeds.For stir frys I trim the bottom so the ribs come free, clean off any dirt that's gotten trapped in between, then stack up the leaves and cut the leaves from the ribs. I slice the ribs into about 5mm / 3/16"" slices, and add them towards the end; the leaves I cut into ribbons (perpendicular to the ribs), and stir them in at the last second, so they barely cook. The center I just chop the top off the leafy bit, and slice the more rib-like bits a litte larger than the rest of the ribs (they're thinner, so cook faster).As I've never tried steaming it, and I don't tend to cook in bags (except for silver turtles when camping), this is going to be a complete guess. Now, it tastes fine al dente, so you could leave the ribs as large as I use for a stir fry, but en papillote tends to be fancier cooking, so I'd probably try for maybe 1/6"" slices or a little thicker (maybe 2-3mm), and if you had a mandoline so they all came out even, that'd be great. I'd still cut the leaves into ribbons, just because it's easier to eat than a huge intact leaf.I'd assume that the leaves would cook at a similar rate as spinich, and the ribs closer to fennel, if that helps at all.  <sep>  Q: How should I prepare Bok Choy before I cook it? A: trim the bottom so the ribs come free, clean off any dirt that's gotten trapped in between, then stack up the leaves and cut the leaves from the ribs  Q: Ok. How should I cook the Bok Choy after I prepare it? A: stir them in at the last second, so they barely cook  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Will the leaf cook faster than the rib?

input: CONTEXT: Personally I'd suggest blanching your pasta. By blanching:I mean get a big pan of heavily salted water on a rolling boil. Drop your pasta into the water, give it a stir.After 1 min or when the water has come back to boil drain the pasta off.At this point your pasta will still be el' dante but not raw which is what I suspect the directions are suggesting when they say ""2 min less than instructed"" then just use it at the mixing with sour cream step.If you were to just use the pasta freshly made it will likely not have the texture desired. Boiling it will help moisten it up and start to cook the flour.  <sep>  Q: Using homemade pasta instead of dried in a bake###'d like to use fresh homemade pasta tonight in place of bagged egg noodles. ###My question is, should I prep the noodles in boiling water in anyway, or should I skip that step and add the freshly made noodles where the recipe calls for it?

input: CONTEXT: My whole wheat bread takes 4x to go off than my white bread. Even a mixture of 50% whole wheat flour will make it last longer. But that will only help if the problem is the bread getting hard too soon. That can also be prevented by keeping it in a plastic bag. You'll get the mold before the bread goes stale.If you're keeping the bread in a plastic bag, try paper bags.To solve the mold problem, the traditional way is to add some acidity. For example, you can add a sourdough starter. If you don't like the taste of sourdough, a poolish starter should also help. The bacteria it grows will prevent the mold growing.I know it's not what you're asking, but freezing will also help. When you bake more bread than you eat, freeze it wrapped in a plastic bag and thaw it overnight and you will get a good, fresh bread.  <sep>  Q: Is there anything I can add to homemade bread to preserve it?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The answer depends on where you live, and what type you have brought.In many countries that import chickpeas they heat treat them to kill seed-borne diseases and insects. The heat treatment process makes them more difficult to cook, and soaking times double or triple.Beans from exporters with phytosanitary certificates can be imported without heat treatment; these are the ones you want to get.I don't think you can tell which is which by looking at them. At the moment we have some particularly dark, dry, and dead looking beans that soak up beautifully in 8 hours!Soak non-heat treated beans for 8 to 12 hours, heat treated beans for 24 to 36 hours. Some overly heat treated beans will never fully revive, and you are best to return these to the shop as ""faulty"".Soak and cook without salt, unless you are going to mash them. They fall apart more readily if salted.If you are not mashing them, the secret to great chickpea taste is after soaking and cooking in water, is to lightly fry them with a little olive oil until dark spot appear, keep them or the pan moving so none burn. Then add the sauce, or add them to whatever dish you are preparing.  <sep>  Q: How should I prepare dried chickpeas?###I've never used dried chickpeas before, but I'm not wanting for chickpea recipes. The bag of dried chickpeas I got contains no instructions for cooking. I know that I need to soak them in water for a period X and then cook them for a period Y.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: In my experience, the most likely impact of a gentle boil vs. a furious rolling boil is going to be on texture of starchy foods, such as potatoes or other root vegetables, rather than flavor.I've found that a gentle simmer of potatoes will result in a mostly intact shape and consistent texture, whereas an aggressive boil without perfect timing can result in the outer layers of the potato breaking apart, sometimes before the center has time to cook fully.I've seen similar issues with stuffed parcels of pasta like ravioli or boiled won tons. I've also found that open pot egg poached eggs have much nicer results with a gentle simmer than an aggressive boil, perhaps for related reasons.Since part of how we experience taste is texture, you could say that the ""taste"" is affected.  <sep>  Q: Can food be boiled ""extra fast/hard"" in water?
