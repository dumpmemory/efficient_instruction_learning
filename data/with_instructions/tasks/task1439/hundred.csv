The only thing to keep in mind is that duck feet, like any other duck parts, are substantially more fatty than their chicken equivalents, so assuming you want a clear or mostly-clear stock, you'll have to spend a lot of time skimming.Alternatively you can clean the feet and other bones by boiling them in plain water for 5-10 minutes, then dumping it all out and starting over - which is what your linked recipe suggests. I don't usually do this for brown stocks because you lose a lot of flavour, but if you're starting from raw then it won't make much difference and it's an easy/lazy way to get rid of a lot of the fat at once. <sep> Q: Can I use duck feet to make duck stock A: The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet  Q: Does it add the same flavor and mouth feel?

input: CONTEXT: Simple: grate it. If you grate the nutmeg using a microplane, it should have a strong, distinctive odor you can smell from a couple feet away. If it doesn't, it's lost its flavor, throw it away and buy new. It's fairly likely you're going to end up replacing it.

input: CONTEXT: I always submerged mine in warm water and, bare handed, worked the cap until it came free. The water should dissolve the salt with the help of the mechanical action. That was with glass bottoms and metal tops. You should be able to brute force your full metal shaker with no ill effect as the metal will have a much higher shear strength than the salt that is binding it.  <sep>  Q: have you untwist a salt shaker before? A: I always submerged mine in warm water and, bare handed, worked the cap until it came free  Q: I can try that but is there a better way? A: The water should dissolve the salt with the help of the mechanical action  Q: Hmm, would it be a good idea to use pliers to pry it open? A: You should be able to brute force your full metal shaker with no ill effect as the metal will have a much higher shear strength than the salt that is binding it  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: that's a good explanation.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I make bacon and other cured meats frequently. I find that the amount of liquid released from pork belly varies. That is not a useful measure of how the cure is proceeding. Bacon, in particular, is usually cooked after the cure, so I don't worry too much. I use the salt-box method, coat the belly in cure mixture, place in large zip lock, place in container slightly larger than belly and put in fridge. Flip every day or so for a week. What I look for next is a firming up of the belly. I pinch it. If it has firmed up after a week, I move on to hot smoking (or you could use your oven). If it still feels soft, I give it another day or two.  <sep>  Q: How much juice should come out when I'm curing pork belly? A: I find that the amount of liquid released from pork belly varies  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: My latest batch has extracted less than half of the juice of the first two. Is this normal?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Traditionally, mozzarella is sold extremely fresh - as in made that day or the day before. If it's held for more than a day or so, it comes packaged in a brine. Most of the American stuff is just too soft to be held for packaging like other shredded cheese in the mega-mart.In the US, being extreme gluttons for convenience, we tend to make do with part-skim shredded mozzarella instead of the good stuff. Slight temperature variations can make the shreds stick together in a globby mass. It's harmless from a safety point of view, and the expiry date can be long after the occurrence of perfectly safe globbiness.Pro-Tip: Put the globby pieces in the freezer for 20 minutes, and then shred it like a block of harder cheese. Upon heating, it will melt (almost) as if the the globbiness had never happened. I have taken advantage of a few good sales that way. Mozzarella will become... ehem... colorful before it becomes unsafe. While this answer is more for mozzerella than for other types of cheese; the last paragraph works for any mega-mart shredded cheese.  <sep>  Q: Why would unopened shredded cheese get soggy in the fridge?

A: It's harmless from a safety point of view, and the expiry date can be long after the occurrence of perfectly safe globbiness  Q: How can I prevent this from happening?

input: CONTEXT: I've never used bhut jolokias but I love spicy vegetable oil. DO NOT just throw the peppers in a jar of oil. Apparently this is bad. Follow the much more helpful links in the comments that follow this and make the oil properly.Once you do this you can cook pretty much anything that needs a little (or a lot) of extra heat. You said you have other peppers so it might be interesting to set up a few jars with different pepper combos.Bonus: if what I've heard of these peppers is correct, you can probably make a low grade mace this way.If you're looking for something to do right away, I'd mix a very small piece in some melty cheese and throw it on some chips, burritos, pizza, or anything really.

But that will only help if the problem is the bread getting hard too soon. That can also be prevented by keeping it in a plastic bag. You'll get the mold before the bread goes stale.If you're keeping the bread in a plastic bag, try paper bags.To solve the mold problem, the traditional way is to add some acidity. For example, you can add a sourdough starter. If you don't like the taste of sourdough, a poolish starter should also help. The bacteria it grows will prevent the mold growing.I know it's not what you're asking, but freezing will also help. When you bake more bread than you eat, freeze it wrapped in a plastic bag and thaw it overnight and you will get a good, fresh bread.  <sep>  Q: Is there anything I can add to homemade bread to preserve it?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Honestly, all three of those will crisp up very quickly, and just about any ratio will produce a crispy end product. The blend may be for textural reasons; potato starch is typically very fine and produces a tempura-like shell, while rice flour can have little bits of individual rice grains which produces a ""chunkier"" texture.I probably wouldn't try to use pure starch as it will brown and burn very easily, but you probably don't even need all three ingredients. Personally, I'd start with a 50/50 blend of potato starch and rice flour and adjust from there. You could use tapioca starch instead of potato if it's easier for you to find locally, but definitely keep rice flour in the mix.  <sep>  Q: Any ideas what ratio of flour, potato startch and rice flour would be optimal for getting a crispy wing?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The primary reason is definitely convenience. If you don't want skin and seeds in your sauce, then you have to do some work to avoid it. Yes, it's possible, e.g. passing through a food mill, or blanching and peeling plus retaining only the flesh, but having it already done is a whole lot easier.Passata is usually much thicker too, so it won't need as long a cooking time to reduce into a non-watery sauce as fresh tomatoes. On top of that, you don't have to worry about whether you can find good fresh tomatoes, e.g. if it's winter and they're out of season.Your two cases for comparison seem to overlook this: if you just chop and cook, you'll have skin and seeds in your sauce, as well as excess liquid to cook down, while if you use passata, you won't. (Also, for what it's worth, you'd need pretty giant tomatoes to get the equivalent of 3/4 cup of passata out of one tomato.)Of course, if you don't mind skin and seeds, it's also perfectly fine to simply cook fresh tomatoes and be done with it.Note that you can often get similar advantages from other canned tomato products. In the US, crushed tomatoes are far more common, and a roughly similar texture. (Peeled whole tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste can also be useful depending on what texture you're aiming for.)  <sep>  Q: Why specifically use Passata, rather than tomatoes, in Ragu? A: The primary reason is definitely convenience  Q: what is a specific difference? A: Passata is usually much thicker  Q: do I cook it much longer? A: it won't need as long a cooking time  Q: how much should I use? A: 3/4 cup of passata  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: what are some differences?

input: CONTEXT: I use 1 rounded teaspoon for 12 to 16 ounces (depends on the mug I'm using), so about 8 teaspoons (or about 2 1/2 tbsp) for a gallon of water. Hot water, just under boiling, is best. Ideally, the water is heated and poured onto the tea at just under boiling. Because I don't think you want to boil a gallon of water, I'd use the amount of hibiscus for a gallon of tea, but only use about a quart of hot water to start, let the tea steep in that (at least 5 minutes, longer will give a stronger flavor) then add the remaining 3 quarts of water.  <sep>  Q: Do you know how to Brew Hibiscus tea?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: There's no reason why you couldn't boil vegetables as you make the stock and then puree them in as a base. It's really about taste and the result you want. Making the stock without vegetables in it will give you a clear broth with a simple pork flavor and the vegetables will be distinct in it. If you add vegetables while cooking the stock and then puree them in your base will be much more vegetable-y, and opaque - the color will be determined by the vegetables added. The pork taste will be a bit more hidden by vegetable flavors. Spices and herbs are 2 separate matters. In general you can overcook herbs very easily but it's hard to overcook spices (although some spices can change during long cooking times). Adding bay (laurel) is one of the exceptions herb-wise. Spice-wise adding at the beginning will make the spice permeate the meat, careful not to overdo it though.Like I said it's all about the look and taste you want.  <sep>  Q: Should I add vegetables and spices in the stock-making stage of pig-knuckle soup?

input: CONTEXT: Scallions are very touchy. You don't want them to dry out, and yet you don't want them too wet or they will get slimy and disgusting.What works best for me is remove any binding holding them together (e.g. rubber band or twisty-tie), (and certainly trim off any parts of the scallions that are already damaged and/or slimy), don't wash until you are ready to use them, wrap the bunch of scallions loosely (but completely covered) in a paper towel, and then store that wrapped bundle in a flimsy plastic bag (maybe the one you brought them home from the supermarket in) in your refrigerator. Sounds ""fussy"" when you lay out all the steps like that, but really, it's not a whole lot of work. Removing the rubber band etc. prevents damage where it would cut into the veg. flesh, paper towel absorbs condensation & liquid water which will rot the scallions (paper towel will prob. become slightly damp after a while in the fridge, but this is OK), plastic bag prevents evaporation of moist air.I find this works well for lots of greens, esp. cilantro - the worst offender in the demanding vegetables category.P.S. If you aren't too squeamish, you can even remove the very outermost layer of a scallion which has begun to ""slime-out"", wash the remainder right before using - & it's fine!  <sep>  Q: How do I preserve scallions? A: Scallions are very touchy. You don't want them to dry out, and yet you don't want them too wet or they will get slimy and disgusting  Q: What is the best way to keep them fresh longer?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I'm an American cornbread lover living in the UK, so I have some experience with this. In the UK and commonwealth corn flour = US cornstarch, and in the UK corn meals are coarser then their US counterparts. Coarse polenta is like ball bearings, fine polenta is still too coarse for decent cornbread and fritters. You can get fine corn meal in the UK now, which is slightly finer than your average US cornmeal, but not as fine as US corn flour. So if I'm in the US using an American recipe that calls for fine corn meal I'd just use regular corn meal, if I'm in the US using a UK recipe and it calls for fine corn meal it would probably mean fine polenta, which is what you generally get in the US.  <sep>  Q: What is ""fine ground cornmeal""?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: In the fridge, an hour should not be a problem, but could still end up bitter depending on the kind of onion used. Usually, Marinades, Pestos etc. that use mashed onions and/or garlic taste best if they are made the way the name ""Pesto"" suggests: Cutting stuff very fine, then using a mortar and pestle. Most explanations WHY that is the case have to with the fact that blenders tend to disintegrate cell walls with relatively rough cuts of a fast but half-sharp or blunt blade, releasing more enzymes etc. from the cell walls as opposed to from the cell contents. These are plausible, since some of the compounds in different parts of onion cells are known to actively react when the onion is disintegrated.Also, try adding oil (which you often want in a marinade anyway. No unrefined olive oil in a blender, though - that is known to get bitter!) while mortaring or blending - this will help extract flavor compounds and probably provide some oxidation protection.There is a well known marinade working with onions, garlic etc: Bulgogi marinade.  <sep>  Q: How long can blended onions stay relatively fresh?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Some of the volatile flavors will be diminished, but I've managed to make fairly good drinks with the help of mint that I kept frozen. In my experience, freezer burn starts to become visible after two or three months, and starts to harm flavor probably around 4-6 months.I'm not sure preparing the drink will work really well, but if you just defrost the drink in the refrigerator, it probably won't be terrible. Active thawing with heat will probably cause some harm.

input: CONTEXT: As with all fish, just don't cook it any longer than necessary - all you need is long enough to get the temperature up (to 145F/63C), and anything past that is just overcooking. Boiling is a really fast cooking method, and simmering or poaching is not much slower. Note that this also means removing it from the water as soon as it's done, since the water is way above the necessary temperature and will easily overcook seafood even if it's removed from the stove.Tiny fish like you mention will probably be done in only a minute or two, similar to small.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Mold is growing because there's something for it to consume, the only way to prevent it from happening is to clean your grill more effectively, or carbonize it before the fire goes out. No grill is air-tight, so even though it gets a good heat blast (not enough to sterilize it as you may think), spores will get in from outside. Remember, hot air is less dense, so as the BBQ cools it will draw air in, hence the spores. Once there they thrive in the sheltered and often damp conditions in a closed-up barbecue. I think where you may be going wrong is that you close the valves after cooking. That cuts off the air and kills the fire. I leave all my valves open to keep it as hot as possible after I'm done cooking, and it does a better job of charring all the leftovers.  <sep>  Q: Curious mold growth in a sealled BBQ, how does one avoid it?

input: CONTEXT: Generally speaking, frying gives a better crust due to the higher direct heat producing more Maillard flavours. A good, heavy, screaming hot pan is required. Oil the steak, not the pan, with vegetable or groundnut oil (olive oil will burn), and baste with butter towards the end for extra flavour.If your steak is thick, you might try a reverse sear - roast the steak at about 150Â°C until the centre is 10Â°C off your desired doneness level (if you don't have a digital probe thermometer, invest the small amount they cost, it is completely worth it), then sear the outside on your mega hot pan. This avoids you having to overdo the outside just to get the inside right.  <sep>  Q: Is it better to fry or grill a steak?

input: CONTEXT: To make you pancakes spread more, and thus be thinner, increase the amount of liquid in the recipe. This will make the batter less viscous, so that it will spread more before beginning to set, thus giving you thinner pancakes. I would start slowly, perhaps a couple of tablespoons extra milk (or just plain water) until you find the consistency that you like.You will also have to experiment to determine the appropriate cooking time, as the additional liquid will somewhat need to be cooked off to get the best texture.Of course, there is nothing wrong with using the bottom of your ladle to help the batter spread out a bit more.

Infusing oil with chilli won't change its cooking properties, and both those oils will store fine long-term.

input: CONTEXT: First off, when reheating soup, it won't matter much. If you get the pan too hot before you add the soup, you could get some spattering, but that's about it.As for making a fresh batch, there are those who believe that browning the ingredients before adding the liquids will develop more flavor. This will be a lot easier to do with a hot pan, than trying to get a cold pan full of stuff up to a heat sufficient to cause browning. Overall, it's a tradeoff. If you're in a hurry, it might be worth saving the few minutes to just throw everything in the pan and heat it up.

input: CONTEXT: Your clarification means a lot -- ""baked"" potato in the U.S. tends to be a whole potato cooked on its own, where the insides become fluffy and creamy, and is done with larger starchy white potatoes, or sweet potatoes work well, too.Roasted potatoes, on the other hand, tends to be (in the U.S.) be smaller ""new"" potatoes, waxy potatoes, or even larger starchy potatoes cut up (eg, 'oven fries').The starchy potatoes only really hold up well when roasting if it's very high heat or a short amount of time -- if you're going to be cooking them with the roast as there's going to be moisture in there, I'd go for a waxy potato (eg, Red Bliss).As for the browning -- probably coat them well with oil, and if they're not brown enough for your liking when you pull the roast, as you're going to have to rest it anyway, drain the meat juices, crank the oven up to somewhere around 450F (230C) and leave the potatoes in for a few extra minutes.ps. yes, I know a sweet potato isn't a potato. And I also tend to use Yukon Gold for just about everything, as it makes great baked potatoes, and roasted potatoes (although, not sure how well with a roast at the same time) and they're good in pot roast and stews if you don't add them too early.  <sep>  Q: What are the best potatoes for baking? A: larger starchy white potatoes, or sweet potatoes work well, too  Q: I should clarify, I am in Australia and we don't really distinguish between baking and roasting, can you suggest a nice roasting potato?

input: CONTEXT: Ribs should not be cooked with direct heat, generally. The directions on the meat are VERY defective. You should turn the left burner on, and put the ribs in the right side of the grill. You should cook at a temperature between 250-300F, typically for 4-5 hours. They're done when the meat pulls back from the bone and when you can easily tear the meat between bones, not when they hit a certain temperature.

input: CONTEXT: A lot of sourdough recipes don't call for a sponge, per se, because the starter essentially already is a sponge. The purpose of a sponge in a bread with normal yeast is to allow a longer fermentation time and extra time for enzymatic reactions to happen in the flour before adding it to the final batch. This isn't necessary with sourdough the starter is continuously fermenting and reacting. And your guess is about right, if the proportion of starter you add is too high, the waste products and dead yeast cells in it can cause changes in the gluten that make it very slack and unusable.  <sep>  Q: How does a sourdough sponge work?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I would use any uncolored brandy made from distilled fruit. Himbeergeist, sliwowitz, or what you can lay your hands on. Kirsch doesn't taste much like cherries, and I suspect that it functions more as a solvent for some of the aroma in the spices than for adding its own taste. Even though it does contribute a bit, the taste will be subtle, and other slight fruity notes from a different fruit brandy will blend with the heavy spices just as well. In a pinch, you could use a colored brandy too, like Chantre. But it will add more of its own flavor, and while it can make a good combination, it will be further from the original than a random obstwasser.

input: CONTEXT: rfusca already gave very good suggestions for the literal question from the title. However, you can also address your problem the other way round. First, cook the soup until your noodles are al dente (but will become just right while cooling at a normal speed). Take the big pot of soup off the heat. Second, take a small pot, and fill it with just one portion of soup per eater. Put it on the heat, and cook until the noodles are done. (Alternatively, put the single portions into porcelain bowls and microwave until the noodles are ready - it spares you washing an additional pot, but I wouldn't nuke a good soup for no reason). Third, eat your cooked soup portions and let the big pot of soup slowly cool on its own. Fourth, freeze the soup from the big pot. Finis. Note that from a food safety point of view, you are better off with flash cooling the soup. But what I outlined here is probably much simple and hassle-free. Plus, 2-3 liters of soup minus a portion or two should spend less than the magical 4 hours in the danger zone while cooling. If you are doing this with a very big pot of soup and feeding lots of people, you should probably prefer a rapid cooling.  <sep>  Q: How can I stop the cooking in my chicken and noodle soup?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I've never tried steaming bok choy, but yes, the ribs and leafy bits cook at different speeds.For stir frys I trim the bottom so the ribs come free, clean off any dirt that's gotten trapped in between, then stack up the leaves and cut the leaves from the ribs. I slice the ribs into about 5mm / 3/16"" slices, and add them towards the end; the leaves I cut into ribbons (perpendicular to the ribs), and stir them in at the last second, so they barely cook. The center I just chop the top off the leafy bit, and slice the more rib-like bits a litte larger than the rest of the ribs (they're thinner, so cook faster).As I've never tried steaming it, and I don't tend to cook in bags (except for silver turtles when camping), this is going to be a complete guess. Now, it tastes fine al dente, so you could leave the ribs as large as I use for a stir fry, but en papillote tends to be fancier cooking, so I'd probably try for maybe 1/6"" slices or a little thicker (maybe 2-3mm), and if you had a mandoline so they all came out even, that'd be great. I'd still cut the leaves into ribbons, just because it's easier to eat than a huge intact leaf.I'd assume that the leaves would cook at a similar rate as spinich, and the ribs closer to fennel, if that helps at all.  <sep>  Q: How should I prepare Bok Choy before I cook it?

input: CONTEXT: A chinoise will not--I speak from daily experience--filter out vanilla seeds. A coffee filter would, but my question is: why on earth would you bother? It's annoying to do (and depending on what the product is, filtering through a coffee filter would ensure you lose other things), and seeing actual vanilla seeds in the final product tells your guests that you are using real vanilla beans, not extract.Professional kitchens do not, generally speaking, attempt to remove the seeds for the reasons noted above.@stephenmacdonald, most dessert recipes that call for a fine mesh strainer do so because there is the possibility of chunky things ending up in the product. In the case of that recipe, I would guess it is to prevent chunks of undissolved gelatine from ending up in the final dessert.  <sep>  Q: Can I filter out vanilla bean seeds? A: A chinoise will not--I speak from daily experience--filter out vanilla seeds. A coffee filter would, but my question is: why on earth would you bother  Q: When I use seeds I scrape out of vanilla beans in my desserts, it always leaves black specks. ###It doesn't seem to alter the taste, but it's not as pretty as professional works. A: seeing actual vanilla seeds in the final product tells your guests that you are using real vanilla beans, not extract  Q: That makes sense. I'd rather my panna cotta be pristine and white, though.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The brown color of the stock comes from the cooking method, not the kind of bones, a chicken stock cooked in the ""brown stock"" method can be as dark as what we expect beef stock to be.Roasting the bones was a good start; but you also need to brown the vegetables, either with the bones for the last half hour or in a pan on the stovetop.One of the most important parts of brown stock is to add tomato to the vegetable mix, either finely diced or more often tomato paste. Cooking the tomato to a dark brick red will round out the components needed to make a very dark stock. Whether you roast all the ingredients together in the oven or separate the vegetables to the stove; deglazing everything as you did helps the flavor, color, and of course makes cleaning the pans easier :)  <sep>  Q: Why did my brown beef stock end up yellow?

There is nothing wrong with this. There is nothing wrong or damaging to have a metal tin touch the metal sides of your oven.How was your baked items bottom? If you can sit your tin up so there is air flow under your tin, then you will improve the baking efficiency and it will bake more evenly.CAUTION: If anyone else is reading this question and wondering about their own machine, then you really need to take caution about the ""convention only"" mode. You have to make sure there are NO microwaves in this mode or else your metal will conduct and you could have a serious explosion or break your microwave oven.  <sep>  Q: Is it okay to use a microwave in convection mode without the turntable?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Mixing it with milk (or liquid in general) is probably just to remove clumps. It clumps easily, especially when things aren't perfectly airtight (probably more common in your grandmother's time), and mixing in a small amount of liquid is an easy way to make sure it all breaks up.I'm less sure about the alternating. It is pretty common to alternate wet and dry as a way of getting things evenly mixed and avoiding lumps, so it's possible it's a variation on that. The paste might be too thick to easily mix into the wet, but also wet enough that it'd tend to stay as a lump if you mix it straight into the dry, so alternating wet-dry-paste might get you more even mixing? But if you're able to mix the paste smoothly into the wet, it's completely fine to just do that.  <sep>  Q: Why pre-mix baking soda into 2 tsp of milk?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Scallions are very touchy. You don't want them to dry out, and yet you don't want them too wet or they will get slimy and disgusting.What works best for me is remove any binding holding them together (e.g. rubber band or twisty-tie), (and certainly trim off any parts of the scallions that are already damaged and/or slimy), don't wash until you are ready to use them, wrap the bunch of scallions loosely (but completely covered) in a paper towel, and then store that wrapped bundle in a flimsy plastic bag (maybe the one you brought them home from the supermarket in) in your refrigerator. Sounds ""fussy"" when you lay out all the steps like that, but really, it's not a whole lot of work. Removing the rubber band etc. prevents damage where it would cut into the veg. flesh, paper towel absorbs condensation & liquid water which will rot the scallions (paper towel will prob. become slightly damp after a while in the fridge, but this is OK), plastic bag prevents evaporation of moist air.I find this works well for lots of greens, esp. cilantro - the worst offender in the demanding vegetables category.P.S. If you aren't too squeamish, you can even remove the very outermost layer of a scallion which has begun to ""slime-out"", wash the remainder right before using - & it's fine!  <sep>  Q: How do I preserve scallions? A: Scallions are very touchy. You don't want them to dry out, and yet you don't want them too wet or they will get slimy and disgusting  Q: Is there a good way to prevent the green part from drying out?

input: CONTEXT: Watt specifies the power of the device.Power is defined as energy per unit time. So watt is how quickly your device consumes energy.If it is an efficient device it will convert more of consumed electricity into heat. So given two equally efficient devices the higher watt one will produce more heat faster and can therefore cook faster than the less watt one.And the third part of your question has already been answered above. Yes, higher watt device will consume more electric power.  <sep>  Q: What role does a watt play in an induction stove? A: Watt specifies the power of the device  Q: Do you know if the watt power affects the cooking method?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Most chicken (or turkey) stock recipes are meant to be fairly neutral in flavor so they can be used in almost any dish. In many culinary traditions, especially those of European tradition, black pepper is appropriate in almost any savory dish.Cloves are an extremely strong and aggressive flavor, which is not traditional in these cuisines.While you could certainly use it in your stock, it would give that warm clove aroma, and you would then want to use the stock only in dishes where that is appropriate.Instead, I would stick to neutral flavors, and if you want clove flavoring, do it when preparing the final dish, not he fundamental stock. You can simmer enough stock for the whatever dish you are making with a few cloves while you are doing your prep on the dish to infuse it, if needed.  <sep>  Q: Can I Use cloves in stocks/broths?

input: CONTEXT: Your clarification means a lot -- ""baked"" potato in the U.S. tends to be a whole potato cooked on its own, where the insides become fluffy and creamy, and is done with larger starchy white potatoes, or sweet potatoes work well, too.Roasted potatoes, on the other hand, tends to be (in the U.S.) be smaller ""new"" potatoes, waxy potatoes, or even larger starchy potatoes cut up (eg, 'oven fries').The starchy potatoes only really hold up well when roasting if it's very high heat or a short amount of time -- if you're going to be cooking them with the roast as there's going to be moisture in there, I'd go for a waxy potato (eg, Red Bliss).As for the browning -- probably coat them well with oil, and if they're not brown enough for your liking when you pull the roast, as you're going to have to rest it anyway, drain the meat juices, crank the oven up to somewhere around 450F (230C) and leave the potatoes in for a few extra minutes.ps. yes, I know a sweet potato isn't a potato.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Breads get their structure from glutens--a type of protein formed by the combination of glutenin with gliaten. Kneading and resting the dough helps the formation of glutens--I assume by shifting glutenin and gliatin molecules around, this increases the odds of bindings occurring.Oils can bind to glutenin and gliatin and inhibit these reactions, so fats--oils and butter--definitely play a role in the texture control.It prevents the dough from getting too elastic, which controls texture. This elasticity change would also change the maximum air bubble size. Altering resting times and yeast quantity also change these, but trading off for a different flavor. Oil may play other roles, but these are what I recall reading about off the top of my head. Yes, it does contribute to flavor as well.  <sep>  Q: What is the purpose of oil or butter in bread?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: To prevent the sticking, you might want to use a spray oil, maybe even just on the foil before you put the vegetables and potatoes on. It's a tiny amount of oil, not enough to make things noticeably greasy, but will be pretty effective. Another spray over the top will make them brown a little more nicely and may even prevent a little drying out. Alternatively, you can just toss them all in a bowl with a small amount of oil; it really doesn't take much, and I'd hardly describe it as ""covering with a lot of oil.""As for preventing things from drying out, first and foremost, don't overcook them. Broccoli and onions both roast very nicely, but you definitely want to pull it out before it starts browning/burning too much. If you slice the potatoes thinly enough, they'll cook in roughly the same amount of time as the broccoli and onions. So if things are getting overcooked, just don't leave them in the oven as long.You can also always try covering them. Another sheet of foil over the top will trap a fair amount of moisture, letting them steam a bit and probably preventing some burning as well.(I suppose it's also possible that it's all drying out because you're cooking them too slowly, so they have plenty of time for moisture to escape, but that seems less likely given the way you described things.)  <sep>  Q: When I cook my meat, I usually bake or broil it, I basically use the oven. I like using the oven to make the side dish while baking the meat. Usually the side dish consists of a combination of sweet potatoes / yams, broccoli and onions. I slice the potatoes and make sure the broccoli pieces and onions are large enough so they will not overcook / burn. However, usually this combination ends up being really dry, and everything sticks to the aluminum foil. ###So im looking to bake side dishes, having problems with dryness A: To prevent the sticking, you might want to use a spray oil, maybe even just on the foil before you put the vegetables and potatoes on  Q: what kind of oil is best? A: Another spray over the top will make them brown a little more nicely and may even prevent a little drying out  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Yes, but which oil is best to be used? I want my meals to be healthy, and covering everything with alot of oil is not appealing to me.

input: CONTEXT: Short answer: No.Long answer: this could probably be made to work, but only for a short time. At some point, and probably within a few uses, the rapid heat cycling from the fire would cause the pizza stone to crack.Pizza stones are made from corderite or clay, sometimes with grog. This offers a smoother surface than firebrick, but that smooth surface is because of a higher amount of vitrification and less airspace in the ceramic. This means they are less resistant to cracking due thermal shock, and the fact that your pizza stone is 1/4 a thick as firebrick makes that worse.In contrast, firebrick is a standard 2.5"" thick, and made from higher-temperature materials with more airspace in the clay itself.

To flavor carnitas all the way through, put them back in the braising liquid that has been reduced since cooking the pork.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: What you describe is grill basting - where a liquid is poured onto the grill and covered (with a metal salad bowl or a basting cover) to more evenly cook the food and maintain its moisture. The liquid is added towards the latter half of cooking, as adding it in the first half of cooking has no real beneficial effect. Additionally, the steam will melt cheese more evenly if grilling burger patties. Typically, this liquid is a stock (chicken or pork stock if cooking chicken, vegetable stock if cooking vegetables and beef stock if cooking beef) or water.On a personal note, I sometimes dissolve a pinch of salt in the water if I don't have any stock available.  <sep>  Q: What is the liquid often ladled onto the grill top in restaurants?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I'm not a professional fudger, but here is my theory: one should add it to the boiling mixture. The reason is that butter has milk solids that are said to âburnâ at low temperatures (somewhere in the range 120C-150C or 250F-300F) which just above the soft ball stage (113C or 235F) needed for making fudge. I interpret the burning to mean that those milk solids (sugars and proteins) get a chance to contribute to the Maillard reaction that gives caramel (and its grained cousin the fudge) its great and rich flavor. Given how unique and varied the flavors arising from butter are, I would not want to miss their contribution by adding them after the heat is gone.  <sep>  Q: Butter usage in fudge? A: I'm not a professional fudger, but here is my theory: one should add it to the boiling mixture  Q: I have a number of questions relating to fudge. Thank you in advance for your help.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: It should be about 7 crackers per cup, maybe 8, depending how finely you crush them. One of the inner packages from your 14.4oz box should be plenty (there are probably three packages with 9 in each, or 4.8oz). If you need to go the other way, that's 1/7 to 1/8 cup per cracker, or more simply, 0.5oz or 15g per cracker.I know this from making graham cracker crusts - and you can confirm it by looking at some recipes. You generally need 1.5 cups of crumbs for a pie crust, and it takes 10-12 crackers. I've seen recipes ranging from 9 to 12 crackers (and checked ten or so when writing this), but I don't think I've ever used fewer than 10. One cup is 2/3 of that, 7 or 8 crackers. (Some people do say 20 or 24 squares, but they're clearly half-cracker squares, not the whole crackers.)For what it's worth, the Martha Stewart crust recipe says ""6 1/2 ounces graham crackers (12 crackers), finely ground (1 1/2 cups)"", and 2/3 of that is 4 1/3 oz, pretty close to 1/3 of your box, maybe a cracker short, so by weight this works out too.  <sep>  Q: How much is a cup of graham cracker crumbs in crackers and weight?###I have a recipe that calls for one cup of graham cracker crumbs. How many crackers am I going to need to crush? A: It should be about 7 crackers per cup, maybe 8, depending how finely you crush them  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: It would also be helpful to know what a cup of graham cracker crumbs weighs.

"Definition: Given a paragraph about cooking, and a set of conversational questions and answers about the paragraph, say whether the passage contains sufficient information to answer the follow-up question. Say Yes if it is answerable; otherwise, say No. The paragraph has the prefix 'CONTEXT:'. Each conversation question has a prefix `Q:` followed by the answer prefix `A:`, and the follow-up question has a prefix `FOLLOWUP_Q:`.
Positive example 1-
input: CONTEXT: Duck feet will render plenty of gelatin because of the amount of cartilage, same as chicken feet. Any bird's feet are a good choice.The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet. The only thing to keep in mind is that duck feet, like any other duck parts, are substantially more fatty than their chicken equivalents, so assuming you want a clear or mostly-clear stock, you'll have to spend a lot of time skimming.Alternatively you can clean the feet and other bones by boiling them in plain water for 5-10 minutes, then dumping it all out and starting over - which is what your linked recipe suggests. I don't usually do this for brown stocks because you lose a lot of flavour, but if you're starting from raw then it won't make much difference and it's an easy/lazy way to get rid of a lot of the fat at once. <sep> Q: Can I use duck feet to make duck stock A: The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet  Q: Does it add the same flavor and mouth feel? A: The only thing to keep in mind is that duck feet, like any other duck parts, are substantially more fatty than their chicken equivalents  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: How does this change things?
output: Yes

input: CONTEXT: Simple: grate it. If you grate the nutmeg using a microplane, it should have a strong, distinctive odor you can smell from a couple feet away. If it doesn't, it's lost its flavor, throw it away and buy new. It's fairly likely you're going to end up replacing it. I've never seen nutmegs get moldy before, and I live somewhere with 80% humidity. It would have to be stored in some very poor conditions to mold. <sep>  Q: How to distinguish nutmeg freshness? A: If you grate the nutmeg using a microplane, it should have a strong, distinctive odor you can smell from a couple feet away. If it doesn't, it's lost its flavor, throw it away and buy new  Q: Does nutmeg come with a good-before date? A: I've never seen nutmegs get moldy before, and I live somewhere with 80% humidity. It would have to be stored in some very poor conditions to mold  Q: How long can nutmeg stay good? <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Is there a way to 'see' (observe) how old the nutmeg is?
output: No
Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I think you've answered your question yourself. You use the bean itself to make vanilla sugar, so obviously there is much flavour in it as well and not just in the seeds.My experience is that you get much more flavour out of the pod if you let it simmer in warm milk/fluid.  <sep>  Q: Is there really a difference by throwing the vanilla pod in as well? A: My experience is that you get much more flavour out of the pod if you let it simmer in warm milk/fluid  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Do recipes just ask you to do so, because you'd get more seeds in the milk or cream, or does the pod itself give a special flavour?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: If the yeast isn't out of date then the most likely sounding culprit is the temperature of your water. It should be between 105-110. If it's too cool then you won't activate the yeast and if you get it too warm you'll start to kill it.Another possible case can be when you're adding the salt. If it's going in before or at the same time as the sugar you will arrest the gas production and activity of the yeast.Get the yeast, sugar, water mixture going first and create a shaggy dough with your flour. Add the salt as you're starting to bring the dough together so that it doesn't act too quickly to arrest the yeast development.If you keep your flour in the freezer or refrigerator, make sure it has come to room temperature before adding it to the water or the chill of the flour will de-activate the yeast.  <sep>  Q: How do I get my pizza dough to rise? A: If the yeast isn't out of date then the most likely sounding culprit is the temperature of your water  Q: What temperature should the water be? A: It should be between 105-110  Q: What else do I need to consider A: Another possible case can be when you're adding the salt. If it's going in before or at the same time as the sugar you will arrest the gas production and activity of the yeast  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Do you have any other advice?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Fudge is basically a chocolate flavored candy.You combine chocolate and a sugar syrup and boil the syrup until you get the desired concentration. Everything else about the recipe is to either minimize sugar crystal size or add flavor.Sweetened condensed milk will do two things-1- give you a nice, caramelly flavor2- Save a little time. Since it has less water to begin with there will be less to boil off.  <sep>  Q: What kind of milk is the best for making fudge? A: Sweetened condensed milk  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Why is sweetened condensed better?
