input: CONTEXT: Short answer: No.Long answer: this could probably be made to work, but only for a short time. At some point, and probably within a few uses, the rapid heat cycling from the fire would cause the pizza stone to crack.Pizza stones are made from corderite or clay, sometimes with grog. This offers a smoother surface than firebrick, but that smooth surface is because of a higher amount of vitrification and less airspace in the ceramic. This means they are less resistant to cracking due thermal shock, and the fact that your pizza stone is 1/4 a thick as firebrick makes that worse.In contrast, firebrick is a standard 2.5"" thick, and made from higher-temperature materials with more airspace in the clay itself. These properties give it both higher thermal insulation, and higher thermal mass (so that it cools down slower). Both of these properties help it resist cracking.  <sep>  Q: Would you suggest using floor pizza oven or a firebrick?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: It sounds very much like you didn't manage to completely dissolve the sugar. It's also possible to get a bad texture from ice crystals in your ice cream, but I don't think you'd describe it as gritty or sandy, just icy.It can be rather difficult to dissolve that much sugar in liquid, especially if it's cold straight from the fridge. You might want to try heating it gently and stirring, and being careful to go until there's no undissolved sugar hiding at the bottom. That does make the chilling take a bit longer, probably more like 4-8 hours or overnight, not just 1-2 hours. But in my experience heating to dissolve is pretty much standard in ice cream recipes, presumably because it's about the only way to do it easily.  <sep>  Q: Homemade ice cream has texture that is gritty, sandy do you know why?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I've never tried steaming bok choy, but yes, the ribs and leafy bits cook at different speeds.For stir frys I trim the bottom so the ribs come free, clean off any dirt that's gotten trapped in between, then stack up the leaves and cut the leaves from the ribs. I slice the ribs into about 5mm / 3/16"" slices, and add them towards the end; the leaves I cut into ribbons (perpendicular to the ribs), and stir them in at the last second, so they barely cook. The center I just chop the top off the leafy bit, and slice the more rib-like bits a litte larger than the rest of the ribs (they're thinner, so cook faster).As I've never tried steaming it, and I don't tend to cook in bags (except for silver turtles when camping), this is going to be a complete guess. Now, it tastes fine al dente, so you could leave the ribs as large as I use for a stir fry, but en papillote tends to be fancier cooking, so I'd probably try for maybe 1/6"" slices or a little thicker (maybe 2-3mm), and if you had a mandoline so they all came out even, that'd be great. I'd still cut the leaves into ribbons, just because it's easier to eat than a huge intact leaf.I'd assume that the leaves would cook at a similar rate as spinich, and the ribs closer to fennel, if that helps at all.  <sep>  Q: How should I prepare Bok Choy before I cook it? A: I trim the bottom so the ribs come free, clean off any dirt that's gotten trapped in between, then stack up the leaves and cut the leaves from the ribs  Q: Won't the leaf cook much faster than the rib? A: the ribs and leafy bits cook at different speeds  Q: Would I prepare it the same way if I wanted to use it in a stir-fry? A: I slice the ribs into about 5mm / 3/16"" slices, and add them towards the end; the leaves I cut into ribbons (perpendicular to the ribs), and stir them in at the last second, so they barely cook  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: How long should I cook the bok choy in the bag with the halibut?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Firstly - shop-bought ""packet"" bread will keep for several days because it contains a lot of preservatives.In his excellent book Bread Matters, Andrew Whitley claims that home-made sourdough breads with very long rises have better keeping properties than home-made bread made with baker's yeast and short rises. This, he claims, is because the sourdough yeast cultivates a culture of friendly bacteria and an acid environment, all of which become natural preservatives. My experience seems to confirm this.Bread recipes containing egg, oil or milk tend to keep for longer than those without.As @SAJ14SAJ says, bread freezes very well. Loss of flavour in the freezer is not a commonly recognised phenomenon.One option is to slice a loaf of bread, bag it and freeze it. Take as many slices as you need at a time. It will defrost very quickly at room temperature, due to its low mass and high surface area.Another option is to make rolls, part-bake, and freeze. When you need them, take as many rolls as you need from the freezer, and place in the oven, to both defrost and complete the baking. You will get fresh baking smells and flavours from this.I suspect that home-made unleavened breads (pita, chapati, tortilla), without added preservatives, will not last long out of the freezer. Their advantage is that with no rise, they are so quick to make that they can be made fresh on-demand.  <sep>  Q: What kind of homemade sandwich bread or wrap lasts longest? A: Andrew Whitley claims that home-made sourdough breads with very long rises have better keeping properties than home-made bread made with baker's yeast and short rises  Q: Are there any breads other that sourdough that last a long time?

input: CONTEXT: For bacterial spoilage, keeping the soup hot would be more effective. As for ""preserving"" the soup, refrigeration will be drastically more effective. The high temperatures of simmering would keep the bacterial level pretty much nil, but the constant heat will ruin your soup on it's own. Anything in the soup will become mush, flavors will become over-concentrated, and some flavors can drastically change from prolonged exposure to such heat.Prompt chilling and cold storage after cooking will greatly slow down the rate at which bacteria can repopulate the soup, and will also keep everything else in the soup about the way it was when the soup was at it's prime. To really keep textures nice, I'd recommend pulling off the soup that will be stored while vegetables & meat are still a little firmer than you'd like so that they'll finish when you reheat.  <sep>  Q: Is continuously simmering or refrigerating cooked soup a more effective way to prevent spoilage?

A: Vegetables don't ripen  Q: Is the growing of a vegetable different from a fruit's? A: The possible exceptions would be the fruits that are labelled vegetables for cooking purposes like some squashes and tomatoes  Q: I could pick a carrot up from the dirt whenever, and eat it, but I would never do that to a strawberry. A: These do need to be ripe  Q: is it dangerous to eat particular vegetables (potatoes, I believe) before they're fully grown? A: Generally speaking veggies are better young. Carrots are particularly sweet and tender when young. Potatoes are also perfectly fine at any size  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: A tomato is considered a fruit, but is a vegetable. They ripen don't they?

input: CONTEXT: Duck feet will render plenty of gelatin because of the amount of cartilage, same as chicken feet. Any bird's feet are a good choice.The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet. The only thing to keep in mind is that duck feet, like any other duck parts, are substantially more fatty than their chicken equivalents, so assuming you want a clear or mostly-clear stock, you'll have to spend a lot of time skimming.Alternatively you can clean the feet and other bones by boiling them in plain water for 5-10 minutes, then dumping it all out and starting over - which is what your linked recipe suggests. I don't usually do this for brown stocks because you lose a lot of flavour, but if you're starting from raw then it won't make much difference and it's an easy/lazy way to get rid of a lot of the fat at once. <sep> Q: Can I use duck feet to make duck stock A: The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet  Q: Does it add the same flavor and mouth feel? A: The only thing to keep in mind is that duck feet, like any other duck parts, are substantially more fatty than their chicken equivalents  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: How does this change things?
output: Yes

input: CONTEXT: Simple: grate it. If you grate the nutmeg using a microplane, it should have a strong, distinctive odor you can smell from a couple feet away. If it doesn't, it's lost its flavor, throw it away and buy new. It's fairly likely you're going to end up replacing it. I've never seen nutmegs get moldy before, and I live somewhere with 80% humidity. It would have to be stored in some very poor conditions to mold. <sep>  Q: How to distinguish nutmeg freshness? A: If you grate the nutmeg using a microplane, it should have a strong, distinctive odor you can smell from a couple feet away. If it doesn't, it's lost its flavor, throw it away and buy new  Q: Does nutmeg come with a good-before date? A: I've never seen nutmegs get moldy before, and I live somewhere with 80% humidity. It would have to be stored in some very poor conditions to mold  Q: How long can nutmeg stay good? <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Is there a way to 'see' (observe) how old the nutmeg is?
output: No
Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: As long as they aren't spoiled they'll be fine for a crumble/crisp/cobbler. You'll want to have someone else taste them to make sure first. They may need less sugar and less or no precooking. If they are really, really mushy then you might want to add some firmer plums or other fruit to give some texture.  <sep>  Q: Are mushy plums OK to use in cooking? A: As long as they aren't spoiled they'll be fine for a crumble/crisp/cobbler  Q: How do you know if they are spoiled? A: If they are really, really mushy then you might want to add some firmer plums or other fruit to give some texture  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Do you have any recipes for plums?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: One of your possible answers is pretty close to what I think is the correct one. To flavor carnitas all the way through, put them back in the braising liquid that has been reduced since cooking the pork. You can create a kind of glaze out of the braising liquid, and toss the shredded pork in that (defat the braising liquid before reducing it).BTW, I never fry carnitas. I may throw them on a greased grill, but I never deep or shallow fry them.  <sep>  Q: How can I get my flavorings to flavor my carnitas all the way through the pork? A: To flavor carnitas all the way through, put them back in the braising liquid that has been reduced since cooking the pork  Q: How should I cook the meat? A: I never fry carnitas. I may throw them on a greased grill, but I never deep or shallow fry them  Q: Should I marinate the meat in orange juice first so it soaks up the seasoning? A: You can create a kind of glaze out of the braising liquid  Q: So how do you cook the meat if you do not fry it? A: put them back in the braising liquid that has been reduced since cooking the pork  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: How long should I leave it cooking with the braising liquid?
