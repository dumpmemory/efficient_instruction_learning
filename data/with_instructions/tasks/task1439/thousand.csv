The only thing to keep in mind is that duck feet, like any other duck parts, are substantially more fatty than their chicken equivalents, so assuming you want a clear or mostly-clear stock, you'll have to spend a lot of time skimming.Alternatively you can clean the feet and other bones by boiling them in plain water for 5-10 minutes, then dumping it all out and starting over - which is what your linked recipe suggests. I don't usually do this for brown stocks because you lose a lot of flavour, but if you're starting from raw then it won't make much difference and it's an easy/lazy way to get rid of a lot of the fat at once. <sep> Q: Can I use duck feet to make duck stock A: The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet  Q: Does it add the same flavor and mouth feel?

input: CONTEXT: Simple: grate it. If you grate the nutmeg using a microplane, it should have a strong, distinctive odor you can smell from a couple feet away. If it doesn't, it's lost its flavor, throw it away and buy new. It's fairly likely you're going to end up replacing it.

input: CONTEXT: I always submerged mine in warm water and, bare handed, worked the cap until it came free. The water should dissolve the salt with the help of the mechanical action. That was with glass bottoms and metal tops. You should be able to brute force your full metal shaker with no ill effect as the metal will have a much higher shear strength than the salt that is binding it.  <sep>  Q: have you untwist a salt shaker before? A: I always submerged mine in warm water and, bare handed, worked the cap until it came free  Q: I can try that but is there a better way? A: The water should dissolve the salt with the help of the mechanical action  Q: Hmm, would it be a good idea to use pliers to pry it open? A: You should be able to brute force your full metal shaker with no ill effect as the metal will have a much higher shear strength than the salt that is binding it  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: that's a good explanation.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I make bacon and other cured meats frequently. I find that the amount of liquid released from pork belly varies. That is not a useful measure of how the cure is proceeding. Bacon, in particular, is usually cooked after the cure, so I don't worry too much. I use the salt-box method, coat the belly in cure mixture, place in large zip lock, place in container slightly larger than belly and put in fridge. Flip every day or so for a week. What I look for next is a firming up of the belly. I pinch it. If it has firmed up after a week, I move on to hot smoking (or you could use your oven). If it still feels soft, I give it another day or two.  <sep>  Q: How much juice should come out when I'm curing pork belly? A: I find that the amount of liquid released from pork belly varies  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: My latest batch has extracted less than half of the juice of the first two. Is this normal?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Traditionally, mozzarella is sold extremely fresh - as in made that day or the day before. If it's held for more than a day or so, it comes packaged in a brine. Most of the American stuff is just too soft to be held for packaging like other shredded cheese in the mega-mart.In the US, being extreme gluttons for convenience, we tend to make do with part-skim shredded mozzarella instead of the good stuff. Slight temperature variations can make the shreds stick together in a globby mass. It's harmless from a safety point of view, and the expiry date can be long after the occurrence of perfectly safe globbiness.Pro-Tip: Put the globby pieces in the freezer for 20 minutes, and then shred it like a block of harder cheese. Upon heating, it will melt (almost) as if the the globbiness had never happened. I have taken advantage of a few good sales that way. Mozzarella will become... ehem... colorful before it becomes unsafe. While this answer is more for mozzerella than for other types of cheese; the last paragraph works for any mega-mart shredded cheese.  <sep>  Q: Why would unopened shredded cheese get soggy in the fridge?

A: It's harmless from a safety point of view, and the expiry date can be long after the occurrence of perfectly safe globbiness  Q: How can I prevent this from happening?

input: CONTEXT: I've never used bhut jolokias but I love spicy vegetable oil. DO NOT just throw the peppers in a jar of oil. Apparently this is bad. Follow the much more helpful links in the comments that follow this and make the oil properly.Once you do this you can cook pretty much anything that needs a little (or a lot) of extra heat. You said you have other peppers so it might be interesting to set up a few jars with different pepper combos.Bonus: if what I've heard of these peppers is correct, you can probably make a low grade mace this way.If you're looking for something to do right away, I'd mix a very small piece in some melty cheese and throw it on some chips, burritos, pizza, or anything really.

But that will only help if the problem is the bread getting hard too soon. That can also be prevented by keeping it in a plastic bag. You'll get the mold before the bread goes stale.If you're keeping the bread in a plastic bag, try paper bags.To solve the mold problem, the traditional way is to add some acidity. For example, you can add a sourdough starter. If you don't like the taste of sourdough, a poolish starter should also help. The bacteria it grows will prevent the mold growing.I know it's not what you're asking, but freezing will also help. When you bake more bread than you eat, freeze it wrapped in a plastic bag and thaw it overnight and you will get a good, fresh bread.  <sep>  Q: Is there anything I can add to homemade bread to preserve it?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Honestly, all three of those will crisp up very quickly, and just about any ratio will produce a crispy end product. The blend may be for textural reasons; potato starch is typically very fine and produces a tempura-like shell, while rice flour can have little bits of individual rice grains which produces a ""chunkier"" texture.I probably wouldn't try to use pure starch as it will brown and burn very easily, but you probably don't even need all three ingredients. Personally, I'd start with a 50/50 blend of potato starch and rice flour and adjust from there. You could use tapioca starch instead of potato if it's easier for you to find locally, but definitely keep rice flour in the mix.  <sep>  Q: Any ideas what ratio of flour, potato startch and rice flour would be optimal for getting a crispy wing?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The primary reason is definitely convenience. If you don't want skin and seeds in your sauce, then you have to do some work to avoid it. Yes, it's possible, e.g. passing through a food mill, or blanching and peeling plus retaining only the flesh, but having it already done is a whole lot easier.Passata is usually much thicker too, so it won't need as long a cooking time to reduce into a non-watery sauce as fresh tomatoes. On top of that, you don't have to worry about whether you can find good fresh tomatoes, e.g. if it's winter and they're out of season.Your two cases for comparison seem to overlook this: if you just chop and cook, you'll have skin and seeds in your sauce, as well as excess liquid to cook down, while if you use passata, you won't. (Also, for what it's worth, you'd need pretty giant tomatoes to get the equivalent of 3/4 cup of passata out of one tomato.)Of course, if you don't mind skin and seeds, it's also perfectly fine to simply cook fresh tomatoes and be done with it.Note that you can often get similar advantages from other canned tomato products. In the US, crushed tomatoes are far more common, and a roughly similar texture. (Peeled whole tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste can also be useful depending on what texture you're aiming for.)  <sep>  Q: Why specifically use Passata, rather than tomatoes, in Ragu? A: The primary reason is definitely convenience  Q: what is a specific difference? A: Passata is usually much thicker  Q: do I cook it much longer? A: it won't need as long a cooking time  Q: how much should I use? A: 3/4 cup of passata  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: what are some differences?

input: CONTEXT: I use 1 rounded teaspoon for 12 to 16 ounces (depends on the mug I'm using), so about 8 teaspoons (or about 2 1/2 tbsp) for a gallon of water. Hot water, just under boiling, is best. Ideally, the water is heated and poured onto the tea at just under boiling. Because I don't think you want to boil a gallon of water, I'd use the amount of hibiscus for a gallon of tea, but only use about a quart of hot water to start, let the tea steep in that (at least 5 minutes, longer will give a stronger flavor) then add the remaining 3 quarts of water.  <sep>  Q: Do you know how to Brew Hibiscus tea?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: There's no reason why you couldn't boil vegetables as you make the stock and then puree them in as a base. It's really about taste and the result you want. Making the stock without vegetables in it will give you a clear broth with a simple pork flavor and the vegetables will be distinct in it. If you add vegetables while cooking the stock and then puree them in your base will be much more vegetable-y, and opaque - the color will be determined by the vegetables added. The pork taste will be a bit more hidden by vegetable flavors. Spices and herbs are 2 separate matters. In general you can overcook herbs very easily but it's hard to overcook spices (although some spices can change during long cooking times). Adding bay (laurel) is one of the exceptions herb-wise. Spice-wise adding at the beginning will make the spice permeate the meat, careful not to overdo it though.Like I said it's all about the look and taste you want.  <sep>  Q: Should I add vegetables and spices in the stock-making stage of pig-knuckle soup?

input: CONTEXT: Scallions are very touchy. You don't want them to dry out, and yet you don't want them too wet or they will get slimy and disgusting.What works best for me is remove any binding holding them together (e.g. rubber band or twisty-tie), (and certainly trim off any parts of the scallions that are already damaged and/or slimy), don't wash until you are ready to use them, wrap the bunch of scallions loosely (but completely covered) in a paper towel, and then store that wrapped bundle in a flimsy plastic bag (maybe the one you brought them home from the supermarket in) in your refrigerator. Sounds ""fussy"" when you lay out all the steps like that, but really, it's not a whole lot of work. Removing the rubber band etc. prevents damage where it would cut into the veg. flesh, paper towel absorbs condensation & liquid water which will rot the scallions (paper towel will prob. become slightly damp after a while in the fridge, but this is OK), plastic bag prevents evaporation of moist air.I find this works well for lots of greens, esp. cilantro - the worst offender in the demanding vegetables category.P.S. If you aren't too squeamish, you can even remove the very outermost layer of a scallion which has begun to ""slime-out"", wash the remainder right before using - & it's fine!  <sep>  Q: How do I preserve scallions? A: Scallions are very touchy. You don't want them to dry out, and yet you don't want them too wet or they will get slimy and disgusting  Q: What is the best way to keep them fresh longer?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I'm an American cornbread lover living in the UK, so I have some experience with this. In the UK and commonwealth corn flour = US cornstarch, and in the UK corn meals are coarser then their US counterparts. Coarse polenta is like ball bearings, fine polenta is still too coarse for decent cornbread and fritters. You can get fine corn meal in the UK now, which is slightly finer than your average US cornmeal, but not as fine as US corn flour. So if I'm in the US using an American recipe that calls for fine corn meal I'd just use regular corn meal, if I'm in the US using a UK recipe and it calls for fine corn meal it would probably mean fine polenta, which is what you generally get in the US.  <sep>  Q: What is ""fine ground cornmeal""?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: In the fridge, an hour should not be a problem, but could still end up bitter depending on the kind of onion used. Usually, Marinades, Pestos etc. that use mashed onions and/or garlic taste best if they are made the way the name ""Pesto"" suggests: Cutting stuff very fine, then using a mortar and pestle. Most explanations WHY that is the case have to with the fact that blenders tend to disintegrate cell walls with relatively rough cuts of a fast but half-sharp or blunt blade, releasing more enzymes etc. from the cell walls as opposed to from the cell contents. These are plausible, since some of the compounds in different parts of onion cells are known to actively react when the onion is disintegrated.Also, try adding oil (which you often want in a marinade anyway. No unrefined olive oil in a blender, though - that is known to get bitter!) while mortaring or blending - this will help extract flavor compounds and probably provide some oxidation protection.There is a well known marinade working with onions, garlic etc: Bulgogi marinade.  <sep>  Q: How long can blended onions stay relatively fresh?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Some of the volatile flavors will be diminished, but I've managed to make fairly good drinks with the help of mint that I kept frozen. In my experience, freezer burn starts to become visible after two or three months, and starts to harm flavor probably around 4-6 months.I'm not sure preparing the drink will work really well, but if you just defrost the drink in the refrigerator, it probably won't be terrible. Active thawing with heat will probably cause some harm.

input: CONTEXT: As with all fish, just don't cook it any longer than necessary - all you need is long enough to get the temperature up (to 145F/63C), and anything past that is just overcooking. Boiling is a really fast cooking method, and simmering or poaching is not much slower. Note that this also means removing it from the water as soon as it's done, since the water is way above the necessary temperature and will easily overcook seafood even if it's removed from the stove.Tiny fish like you mention will probably be done in only a minute or two, similar to small.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Mold is growing because there's something for it to consume, the only way to prevent it from happening is to clean your grill more effectively, or carbonize it before the fire goes out. No grill is air-tight, so even though it gets a good heat blast (not enough to sterilize it as you may think), spores will get in from outside. Remember, hot air is less dense, so as the BBQ cools it will draw air in, hence the spores. Once there they thrive in the sheltered and often damp conditions in a closed-up barbecue. I think where you may be going wrong is that you close the valves after cooking. That cuts off the air and kills the fire. I leave all my valves open to keep it as hot as possible after I'm done cooking, and it does a better job of charring all the leftovers.  <sep>  Q: Curious mold growth in a sealled BBQ, how does one avoid it?

input: CONTEXT: Generally speaking, frying gives a better crust due to the higher direct heat producing more Maillard flavours. A good, heavy, screaming hot pan is required. Oil the steak, not the pan, with vegetable or groundnut oil (olive oil will burn), and baste with butter towards the end for extra flavour.If your steak is thick, you might try a reverse sear - roast the steak at about 150Â°C until the centre is 10Â°C off your desired doneness level (if you don't have a digital probe thermometer, invest the small amount they cost, it is completely worth it), then sear the outside on your mega hot pan. This avoids you having to overdo the outside just to get the inside right.  <sep>  Q: Is it better to fry or grill a steak?

input: CONTEXT: To make you pancakes spread more, and thus be thinner, increase the amount of liquid in the recipe. This will make the batter less viscous, so that it will spread more before beginning to set, thus giving you thinner pancakes. I would start slowly, perhaps a couple of tablespoons extra milk (or just plain water) until you find the consistency that you like.You will also have to experiment to determine the appropriate cooking time, as the additional liquid will somewhat need to be cooked off to get the best texture.Of course, there is nothing wrong with using the bottom of your ladle to help the batter spread out a bit more.

Infusing oil with chilli won't change its cooking properties, and both those oils will store fine long-term.

input: CONTEXT: First off, when reheating soup, it won't matter much. If you get the pan too hot before you add the soup, you could get some spattering, but that's about it.As for making a fresh batch, there are those who believe that browning the ingredients before adding the liquids will develop more flavor. This will be a lot easier to do with a hot pan, than trying to get a cold pan full of stuff up to a heat sufficient to cause browning. Overall, it's a tradeoff. If you're in a hurry, it might be worth saving the few minutes to just throw everything in the pan and heat it up.

input: CONTEXT: Your clarification means a lot -- ""baked"" potato in the U.S. tends to be a whole potato cooked on its own, where the insides become fluffy and creamy, and is done with larger starchy white potatoes, or sweet potatoes work well, too.Roasted potatoes, on the other hand, tends to be (in the U.S.) be smaller ""new"" potatoes, waxy potatoes, or even larger starchy potatoes cut up (eg, 'oven fries').The starchy potatoes only really hold up well when roasting if it's very high heat or a short amount of time -- if you're going to be cooking them with the roast as there's going to be moisture in there, I'd go for a waxy potato (eg, Red Bliss).As for the browning -- probably coat them well with oil, and if they're not brown enough for your liking when you pull the roast, as you're going to have to rest it anyway, drain the meat juices, crank the oven up to somewhere around 450F (230C) and leave the potatoes in for a few extra minutes.ps. yes, I know a sweet potato isn't a potato. And I also tend to use Yukon Gold for just about everything, as it makes great baked potatoes, and roasted potatoes (although, not sure how well with a roast at the same time) and they're good in pot roast and stews if you don't add them too early.  <sep>  Q: What are the best potatoes for baking? A: larger starchy white potatoes, or sweet potatoes work well, too  Q: I should clarify, I am in Australia and we don't really distinguish between baking and roasting, can you suggest a nice roasting potato?

input: CONTEXT: Ribs should not be cooked with direct heat, generally. The directions on the meat are VERY defective. You should turn the left burner on, and put the ribs in the right side of the grill. You should cook at a temperature between 250-300F, typically for 4-5 hours. They're done when the meat pulls back from the bone and when you can easily tear the meat between bones, not when they hit a certain temperature.

input: CONTEXT: A lot of sourdough recipes don't call for a sponge, per se, because the starter essentially already is a sponge. The purpose of a sponge in a bread with normal yeast is to allow a longer fermentation time and extra time for enzymatic reactions to happen in the flour before adding it to the final batch. This isn't necessary with sourdough the starter is continuously fermenting and reacting. And your guess is about right, if the proportion of starter you add is too high, the waste products and dead yeast cells in it can cause changes in the gluten that make it very slack and unusable.  <sep>  Q: How does a sourdough sponge work?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I would use any uncolored brandy made from distilled fruit. Himbeergeist, sliwowitz, or what you can lay your hands on. Kirsch doesn't taste much like cherries, and I suspect that it functions more as a solvent for some of the aroma in the spices than for adding its own taste. Even though it does contribute a bit, the taste will be subtle, and other slight fruity notes from a different fruit brandy will blend with the heavy spices just as well. In a pinch, you could use a colored brandy too, like Chantre. But it will add more of its own flavor, and while it can make a good combination, it will be further from the original than a random obstwasser.

input: CONTEXT: rfusca already gave very good suggestions for the literal question from the title. However, you can also address your problem the other way round. First, cook the soup until your noodles are al dente (but will become just right while cooling at a normal speed). Take the big pot of soup off the heat. Second, take a small pot, and fill it with just one portion of soup per eater. Put it on the heat, and cook until the noodles are done. (Alternatively, put the single portions into porcelain bowls and microwave until the noodles are ready - it spares you washing an additional pot, but I wouldn't nuke a good soup for no reason). Third, eat your cooked soup portions and let the big pot of soup slowly cool on its own. Fourth, freeze the soup from the big pot. Finis. Note that from a food safety point of view, you are better off with flash cooling the soup. But what I outlined here is probably much simple and hassle-free. Plus, 2-3 liters of soup minus a portion or two should spend less than the magical 4 hours in the danger zone while cooling. If you are doing this with a very big pot of soup and feeding lots of people, you should probably prefer a rapid cooling.  <sep>  Q: How can I stop the cooking in my chicken and noodle soup?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I've never tried steaming bok choy, but yes, the ribs and leafy bits cook at different speeds.For stir frys I trim the bottom so the ribs come free, clean off any dirt that's gotten trapped in between, then stack up the leaves and cut the leaves from the ribs. I slice the ribs into about 5mm / 3/16"" slices, and add them towards the end; the leaves I cut into ribbons (perpendicular to the ribs), and stir them in at the last second, so they barely cook. The center I just chop the top off the leafy bit, and slice the more rib-like bits a litte larger than the rest of the ribs (they're thinner, so cook faster).As I've never tried steaming it, and I don't tend to cook in bags (except for silver turtles when camping), this is going to be a complete guess. Now, it tastes fine al dente, so you could leave the ribs as large as I use for a stir fry, but en papillote tends to be fancier cooking, so I'd probably try for maybe 1/6"" slices or a little thicker (maybe 2-3mm), and if you had a mandoline so they all came out even, that'd be great. I'd still cut the leaves into ribbons, just because it's easier to eat than a huge intact leaf.I'd assume that the leaves would cook at a similar rate as spinich, and the ribs closer to fennel, if that helps at all.  <sep>  Q: How should I prepare Bok Choy before I cook it?

input: CONTEXT: A chinoise will not--I speak from daily experience--filter out vanilla seeds. A coffee filter would, but my question is: why on earth would you bother? It's annoying to do (and depending on what the product is, filtering through a coffee filter would ensure you lose other things), and seeing actual vanilla seeds in the final product tells your guests that you are using real vanilla beans, not extract.Professional kitchens do not, generally speaking, attempt to remove the seeds for the reasons noted above.@stephenmacdonald, most dessert recipes that call for a fine mesh strainer do so because there is the possibility of chunky things ending up in the product. In the case of that recipe, I would guess it is to prevent chunks of undissolved gelatine from ending up in the final dessert.  <sep>  Q: Can I filter out vanilla bean seeds? A: A chinoise will not--I speak from daily experience--filter out vanilla seeds. A coffee filter would, but my question is: why on earth would you bother  Q: When I use seeds I scrape out of vanilla beans in my desserts, it always leaves black specks. ###It doesn't seem to alter the taste, but it's not as pretty as professional works. A: seeing actual vanilla seeds in the final product tells your guests that you are using real vanilla beans, not extract  Q: That makes sense. I'd rather my panna cotta be pristine and white, though.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The brown color of the stock comes from the cooking method, not the kind of bones, a chicken stock cooked in the ""brown stock"" method can be as dark as what we expect beef stock to be.Roasting the bones was a good start; but you also need to brown the vegetables, either with the bones for the last half hour or in a pan on the stovetop.One of the most important parts of brown stock is to add tomato to the vegetable mix, either finely diced or more often tomato paste. Cooking the tomato to a dark brick red will round out the components needed to make a very dark stock. Whether you roast all the ingredients together in the oven or separate the vegetables to the stove; deglazing everything as you did helps the flavor, color, and of course makes cleaning the pans easier :)  <sep>  Q: Why did my brown beef stock end up yellow?

There is nothing wrong with this. There is nothing wrong or damaging to have a metal tin touch the metal sides of your oven.How was your baked items bottom? If you can sit your tin up so there is air flow under your tin, then you will improve the baking efficiency and it will bake more evenly.CAUTION: If anyone else is reading this question and wondering about their own machine, then you really need to take caution about the ""convention only"" mode. You have to make sure there are NO microwaves in this mode or else your metal will conduct and you could have a serious explosion or break your microwave oven.  <sep>  Q: Is it okay to use a microwave in convection mode without the turntable?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Mixing it with milk (or liquid in general) is probably just to remove clumps. It clumps easily, especially when things aren't perfectly airtight (probably more common in your grandmother's time), and mixing in a small amount of liquid is an easy way to make sure it all breaks up.I'm less sure about the alternating. It is pretty common to alternate wet and dry as a way of getting things evenly mixed and avoiding lumps, so it's possible it's a variation on that. The paste might be too thick to easily mix into the wet, but also wet enough that it'd tend to stay as a lump if you mix it straight into the dry, so alternating wet-dry-paste might get you more even mixing? But if you're able to mix the paste smoothly into the wet, it's completely fine to just do that.  <sep>  Q: Why pre-mix baking soda into 2 tsp of milk?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Scallions are very touchy. You don't want them to dry out, and yet you don't want them too wet or they will get slimy and disgusting.What works best for me is remove any binding holding them together (e.g. rubber band or twisty-tie), (and certainly trim off any parts of the scallions that are already damaged and/or slimy), don't wash until you are ready to use them, wrap the bunch of scallions loosely (but completely covered) in a paper towel, and then store that wrapped bundle in a flimsy plastic bag (maybe the one you brought them home from the supermarket in) in your refrigerator. Sounds ""fussy"" when you lay out all the steps like that, but really, it's not a whole lot of work. Removing the rubber band etc. prevents damage where it would cut into the veg. flesh, paper towel absorbs condensation & liquid water which will rot the scallions (paper towel will prob. become slightly damp after a while in the fridge, but this is OK), plastic bag prevents evaporation of moist air.I find this works well for lots of greens, esp. cilantro - the worst offender in the demanding vegetables category.P.S. If you aren't too squeamish, you can even remove the very outermost layer of a scallion which has begun to ""slime-out"", wash the remainder right before using - & it's fine!  <sep>  Q: How do I preserve scallions? A: Scallions are very touchy. You don't want them to dry out, and yet you don't want them too wet or they will get slimy and disgusting  Q: Is there a good way to prevent the green part from drying out?

input: CONTEXT: Watt specifies the power of the device.Power is defined as energy per unit time. So watt is how quickly your device consumes energy.If it is an efficient device it will convert more of consumed electricity into heat. So given two equally efficient devices the higher watt one will produce more heat faster and can therefore cook faster than the less watt one.And the third part of your question has already been answered above. Yes, higher watt device will consume more electric power.  <sep>  Q: What role does a watt play in an induction stove? A: Watt specifies the power of the device  Q: Do you know if the watt power affects the cooking method?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Most chicken (or turkey) stock recipes are meant to be fairly neutral in flavor so they can be used in almost any dish. In many culinary traditions, especially those of European tradition, black pepper is appropriate in almost any savory dish.Cloves are an extremely strong and aggressive flavor, which is not traditional in these cuisines.While you could certainly use it in your stock, it would give that warm clove aroma, and you would then want to use the stock only in dishes where that is appropriate.Instead, I would stick to neutral flavors, and if you want clove flavoring, do it when preparing the final dish, not he fundamental stock. You can simmer enough stock for the whatever dish you are making with a few cloves while you are doing your prep on the dish to infuse it, if needed.  <sep>  Q: Can I Use cloves in stocks/broths?

input: CONTEXT: Your clarification means a lot -- ""baked"" potato in the U.S. tends to be a whole potato cooked on its own, where the insides become fluffy and creamy, and is done with larger starchy white potatoes, or sweet potatoes work well, too.Roasted potatoes, on the other hand, tends to be (in the U.S.) be smaller ""new"" potatoes, waxy potatoes, or even larger starchy potatoes cut up (eg, 'oven fries').The starchy potatoes only really hold up well when roasting if it's very high heat or a short amount of time -- if you're going to be cooking them with the roast as there's going to be moisture in there, I'd go for a waxy potato (eg, Red Bliss).As for the browning -- probably coat them well with oil, and if they're not brown enough for your liking when you pull the roast, as you're going to have to rest it anyway, drain the meat juices, crank the oven up to somewhere around 450F (230C) and leave the potatoes in for a few extra minutes.ps. yes, I know a sweet potato isn't a potato.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Breads get their structure from glutens--a type of protein formed by the combination of glutenin with gliaten. Kneading and resting the dough helps the formation of glutens--I assume by shifting glutenin and gliatin molecules around, this increases the odds of bindings occurring.Oils can bind to glutenin and gliatin and inhibit these reactions, so fats--oils and butter--definitely play a role in the texture control.It prevents the dough from getting too elastic, which controls texture. This elasticity change would also change the maximum air bubble size. Altering resting times and yeast quantity also change these, but trading off for a different flavor. Oil may play other roles, but these are what I recall reading about off the top of my head. Yes, it does contribute to flavor as well.  <sep>  Q: What is the purpose of oil or butter in bread?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: To prevent the sticking, you might want to use a spray oil, maybe even just on the foil before you put the vegetables and potatoes on. It's a tiny amount of oil, not enough to make things noticeably greasy, but will be pretty effective. Another spray over the top will make them brown a little more nicely and may even prevent a little drying out. Alternatively, you can just toss them all in a bowl with a small amount of oil; it really doesn't take much, and I'd hardly describe it as ""covering with a lot of oil.""As for preventing things from drying out, first and foremost, don't overcook them. Broccoli and onions both roast very nicely, but you definitely want to pull it out before it starts browning/burning too much. If you slice the potatoes thinly enough, they'll cook in roughly the same amount of time as the broccoli and onions. So if things are getting overcooked, just don't leave them in the oven as long.You can also always try covering them. Another sheet of foil over the top will trap a fair amount of moisture, letting them steam a bit and probably preventing some burning as well.(I suppose it's also possible that it's all drying out because you're cooking them too slowly, so they have plenty of time for moisture to escape, but that seems less likely given the way you described things.)  <sep>  Q: When I cook my meat, I usually bake or broil it, I basically use the oven. I like using the oven to make the side dish while baking the meat. Usually the side dish consists of a combination of sweet potatoes / yams, broccoli and onions. I slice the potatoes and make sure the broccoli pieces and onions are large enough so they will not overcook / burn. However, usually this combination ends up being really dry, and everything sticks to the aluminum foil. ###So im looking to bake side dishes, having problems with dryness A: To prevent the sticking, you might want to use a spray oil, maybe even just on the foil before you put the vegetables and potatoes on  Q: what kind of oil is best? A: Another spray over the top will make them brown a little more nicely and may even prevent a little drying out  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Yes, but which oil is best to be used? I want my meals to be healthy, and covering everything with alot of oil is not appealing to me.

input: CONTEXT: Short answer: No.Long answer: this could probably be made to work, but only for a short time. At some point, and probably within a few uses, the rapid heat cycling from the fire would cause the pizza stone to crack.Pizza stones are made from corderite or clay, sometimes with grog. This offers a smoother surface than firebrick, but that smooth surface is because of a higher amount of vitrification and less airspace in the ceramic. This means they are less resistant to cracking due thermal shock, and the fact that your pizza stone is 1/4 a thick as firebrick makes that worse.In contrast, firebrick is a standard 2.5"" thick, and made from higher-temperature materials with more airspace in the clay itself.

To flavor carnitas all the way through, put them back in the braising liquid that has been reduced since cooking the pork.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: What you describe is grill basting - where a liquid is poured onto the grill and covered (with a metal salad bowl or a basting cover) to more evenly cook the food and maintain its moisture. The liquid is added towards the latter half of cooking, as adding it in the first half of cooking has no real beneficial effect. Additionally, the steam will melt cheese more evenly if grilling burger patties. Typically, this liquid is a stock (chicken or pork stock if cooking chicken, vegetable stock if cooking vegetables and beef stock if cooking beef) or water.On a personal note, I sometimes dissolve a pinch of salt in the water if I don't have any stock available.  <sep>  Q: What is the liquid often ladled onto the grill top in restaurants?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I'm not a professional fudger, but here is my theory: one should add it to the boiling mixture. The reason is that butter has milk solids that are said to âburnâ at low temperatures (somewhere in the range 120C-150C or 250F-300F) which just above the soft ball stage (113C or 235F) needed for making fudge. I interpret the burning to mean that those milk solids (sugars and proteins) get a chance to contribute to the Maillard reaction that gives caramel (and its grained cousin the fudge) its great and rich flavor. Given how unique and varied the flavors arising from butter are, I would not want to miss their contribution by adding them after the heat is gone.  <sep>  Q: Butter usage in fudge? A: I'm not a professional fudger, but here is my theory: one should add it to the boiling mixture  Q: I have a number of questions relating to fudge. Thank you in advance for your help.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: It should be about 7 crackers per cup, maybe 8, depending how finely you crush them. One of the inner packages from your 14.4oz box should be plenty (there are probably three packages with 9 in each, or 4.8oz). If you need to go the other way, that's 1/7 to 1/8 cup per cracker, or more simply, 0.5oz or 15g per cracker.I know this from making graham cracker crusts - and you can confirm it by looking at some recipes. You generally need 1.5 cups of crumbs for a pie crust, and it takes 10-12 crackers. I've seen recipes ranging from 9 to 12 crackers (and checked ten or so when writing this), but I don't think I've ever used fewer than 10. One cup is 2/3 of that, 7 or 8 crackers. (Some people do say 20 or 24 squares, but they're clearly half-cracker squares, not the whole crackers.)For what it's worth, the Martha Stewart crust recipe says ""6 1/2 ounces graham crackers (12 crackers), finely ground (1 1/2 cups)"", and 2/3 of that is 4 1/3 oz, pretty close to 1/3 of your box, maybe a cracker short, so by weight this works out too.  <sep>  Q: How much is a cup of graham cracker crumbs in crackers and weight?###I have a recipe that calls for one cup of graham cracker crumbs. How many crackers am I going to need to crush? A: It should be about 7 crackers per cup, maybe 8, depending how finely you crush them  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: It would also be helpful to know what a cup of graham cracker crumbs weighs.

Any bird's feet are a good choice.The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet. The only thing to keep in mind is that duck feet, like any other duck parts, are substantially more fatty than their chicken equivalents, so assuming you want a clear or mostly-clear stock, you'll have to spend a lot of time skimming.Alternatively you can clean the feet and other bones by boiling them in plain water for 5-10 minutes, then dumping it all out and starting over - which is what your linked recipe suggests. I don't usually do this for brown stocks because you lose a lot of flavour, but if you're starting from raw then it won't make much difference and it's an easy/lazy way to get rid of a lot of the fat at once. <sep> Q: Can I use duck feet to make duck stock A: The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet  Q: Does it add the same flavor and mouth feel?

input: CONTEXT: I think you've answered your question yourself. You use the bean itself to make vanilla sugar, so obviously there is much flavour in it as well and not just in the seeds.My experience is that you get much more flavour out of the pod if you let it simmer in warm milk/fluid.  <sep>  Q: Is there really a difference by throwing the vanilla pod in as well? A: My experience is that you get much more flavour out of the pod if you let it simmer in warm milk/fluid  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Do recipes just ask you to do so, because you'd get more seeds in the milk or cream, or does the pod itself give a special flavour?

input: CONTEXT: If the yeast isn't out of date then the most likely sounding culprit is the temperature of your water. It should be between 105-110. If it's too cool then you won't activate the yeast and if you get it too warm you'll start to kill it.Another possible case can be when you're adding the salt. If it's going in before or at the same time as the sugar you will arrest the gas production and activity of the yeast.Get the yeast, sugar, water mixture going first and create a shaggy dough with your flour. Add the salt as you're starting to bring the dough together so that it doesn't act too quickly to arrest the yeast development.If you keep your flour in the freezer or refrigerator, make sure it has come to room temperature before adding it to the water or the chill of the flour will de-activate the yeast.  <sep>  Q: How do I get my pizza dough to rise?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Traditionally, mozzarella is sold extremely fresh - as in made that day or the day before. If it's held for more than a day or so, it comes packaged in a brine. Most of the American stuff is just too soft to be held for packaging like other shredded cheese in the mega-mart.In the US, being extreme gluttons for convenience, we tend to make do with part-skim shredded mozzarella instead of the good stuff. Slight temperature variations can make the shreds stick together in a globby mass. It's harmless from a safety point of view, and the expiry date can be long after the occurrence of perfectly safe globbiness.Pro-Tip: Put the globby pieces in the freezer for 20 minutes, and then shred it like a block of harder cheese. Upon heating, it will melt (almost) as if the the globbiness had never happened. I have taken advantage of a few good sales that way. Mozzarella will become... ehem... colorful before it becomes unsafe. While this answer is more for mozzerella than for other types of cheese; the last paragraph works for any mega-mart shredded cheese.  <sep>  Q: Why would unopened shredded cheese get soggy in the fridge? A: Slight temperature variations can make the shreds stick together in a globby mass  Q: Is this normal?

input: CONTEXT: I am afraid that gloves make things worse. Even with proper training, people who wear gloves seem to be more complacent that those who do not wear gloves. I have seen people handle dollar bills then turn around and touch my food with the same gloves on. Disgusting, and I refuse the food, and when I tell them why, they say the gloves are to protect me...what the F ever. Then I ask them how that glove protects meFromThe germs on those dollars you just touched?I find its better to enforce good hand washing habits than it is to allow gloves to be used at all. When you are wearing gloves, you don't even wipe your hand on a towel, without gloves your hands kinda start to tell you they need to be washed if you've been lax.  <sep>  Q: Why use gloves when handling food?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I don't think this has a single answer: The amount of alcohol would depend on the alcohol content of the soaking liquor or liqueur, soaking time, temperature of chocolate, and how thick the strawberry was. I suspect uncut strawberries would take at least several days to fully absorb alcohol and reach equilibrium, but the surface should take up alcohol fairly quickly. If they are cut up, exposing the more porous interior, I imagine an overnight soak would be sufficient to reach maximum alcohol content. The enormous, bloated mutant strawberries you sometimes see at stores could take considerably longer than others to absorb their maximum alcohol. Alcohol is much more volatile than water, so the immersion in warm, melted chocolate would remove some alcohol, but once the chocolate cools, it should trap any remaining content.The flavor of alcohol is easily masked by other flavors at under 20% content; this could explain why your friend didn't taste it, but you did. It's quite possible the strawberries packed a sobriety-busting punch, but it was disguised by the chocolate and fruit tastes.  <sep>  Q: How much alcohol remains in strawberries soaked in alcohol? A: I don't think this has a single answer: The amount of alcohol would depend on the alcohol content of the soaking liquor or liqueur, soaking time, temperature of chocolate  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: I'm reading that approx. 30% is lost, do you think that would be an average number?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: There's no reason why you couldn't boil vegetables as you make the stock and then puree them in as a base. It's really about taste and the result you want. Making the stock without vegetables in it will give you a clear broth with a simple pork flavor and the vegetables will be distinct in it. If you add vegetables while cooking the stock and then puree them in your base will be much more vegetable-y, and opaque - the color will be determined by the vegetables added. The pork taste will be a bit more hidden by vegetable flavors. Spices and herbs are 2 separate matters. In general you can overcook herbs very easily but it's hard to overcook spices (although some spices can change during long cooking times). Adding bay (laurel) is one of the exceptions herb-wise. Spice-wise adding at the beginning will make the spice permeate the meat, careful not to overdo it though.Like I said it's all about the look and taste you want.  <sep>  Q: Should I add vegetables and spices in the stock-making stage of pig-knuckle soup?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I've struggled with this issue as well because I live in a moist climate and instant espresso powder cakes up on me between uses.Generally recipes which use instant espresso power are trying to add a kick of bitter and roasted flavors to deepen chocolate flavors and make them richer. You can try substituting instant coffee 1:1, but the flavor of the baked good will certainly suffer a loss of richness. Increasing the amount of instant coffee, however, would likely add more bitter or acidic flavors -- and caffeine -- to the cookie or cake than you want. Also, instant coffee takes longer to dissolve, so it needs to be added straight to a liquid.There's no real way to substitute liquid coffee in most recipes, such as chocolate cookie or brownie recipes, because the recipe has no water in it in the first place. In the rare recipes where there is water, you could substitute strong-brewed coffee for an equal quantity of water+espresso powder, and this would likely work fairly well.So, summing up: there's no really good substitute for instant espresso powder in recipes which call for it that I've found with some significant experimentation. Hopefully someone else has had better ideas than me.  <sep>  Q: Instant espresso powder substitutions? A: you could substitute strong-brewed coffee for an equal quantity of water+espresso powder  Q: I don't have the powder, thats what I'd like to substitute.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Our brains are wired to consider food more palatable if the dedicated taste receptors (one of the six basic tastes) for salt are triggered. And in a non-urban world, salt/sodium is a valuable nutrient; the fact we might have it too readily available in the developed world doesn't change that we would DIE on a zero-sodium diet (mind that animal products like meat aren't zero-sodium, and that herbivores tend to love licking salt where they find it!). So our brains have a good evolutionary reason to like salt.Also, salt actively interferes (negatively) with another basic taste receptor - the receptor for bitterness (which can mean poison both in nature and in the developed world, or at least something we have no use for, eg an alkali). Most aromatic food (think green vegetables or spices) is bitter, and salt both attenuates that perception and balances it making the combined food still desirable for our brain. You end up with an even more palatable food since you can use an aromatic (desirable) and shut out the bitterness (not always desirable) response.Umami is a different basic taste, probably related to the presence of protein (glutamate, inosinate, guanylate... trigger it - these are amino acids or salts thereof, and an indicator of easily-digestible protein presence).  <sep>  Q: Why does salt enhance the flavor of food?

input: CONTEXT: One of the first things I learned in Indian cooking is that the combination of tomatoes, onions and ginger is self-thickening. As time went by, I realised that the thickening effect is far more noticable with old varieties of tomatoes - ""beef"" tomatoes and a lot of the modern varieties are difficult to thicken unless partially fried first.Despite the absence of ginger, I suspect that the thickening is purely a natural action between the tomatoes and the onion, and that the tomatoes used were some particularly nice old variety.  <sep>  Q: Why did my tomato soup turn thick and brownish?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: While I suspect that the formula is mostly reliable if you repeat the experiment with the same person, I found the individual heat sensitivity varies a lot. Most professional cooks and seasoned homemakers can handle (pun intended) higher heat than those who rarely expose their hands to high temperatures. In our home, weâve had heated discussions about whether the dishes in the just finished dishwasher are too hot to touch or not. And this is just one example.If you exclude the differences between individuals, using your own handâs heat sensitivity to gauge a temperature range is absolutely possible (as long as a few degrees donât matter). It takes time and practice - which is usually described as âexperienceâ. I personally donât think in âdegreesâ though, but more in categories like âtoo coldâ / âshould be okâ / âtoo hotâ and a few steps in between. So in short, if you need a precise temperature, get a thermometer. If you are still working on judging by hand, either get a thermometer or plan a few trial-and-error loops. And sometimes the exact temperature is not important for a recipe to work.Using the X-time at Y-distance formula may work, if your heat sensitivity is similar to the authorâs.  <sep>  Q: How accurate is the hand technique for grilling?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: This 'trick' is used by many a fine chef. Meat is salted, wrapped and refrigerated hours or even overnight, prior to cooking. Yes, salt will draw moisture from the meat initially, but over time that moisture will migrate back into the meat taking the salt with it! The salt also breaks down the protein structure in the muscle rendering a more tender steak.The steak is rinsed and dried (a wet steak will steam not char), seasoned, and fired.Ground beef can be handled in the same fashion. Using a medium or coarse salt and erring on the less salty side, you can find the right proportion to suit your taste. Season before forming or after. Some contend that the seasoning is made bitter by the heat and flame of the grill. Go figure.Other tips: The meat should be mixed and formed with a gentle hand â use only as much pressure as it takes to hold the patties together. For almost foolproof rare or medium-rare meat, go right from fridge to grill.  <sep>  Q: Do you know why, what makes a burger taste so salty? A: This 'trick' is used by many a fine chef.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The primary reason is definitely convenience. If you don't want skin and seeds in your sauce, then you have to do some work to avoid it. Yes, it's possible, e.g. passing through a food mill, or blanching and peeling plus retaining only the flesh, but having it already done is a whole lot easier.Passata is usually much thicker too, so it won't need as long a cooking time to reduce into a non-watery sauce as fresh tomatoes. On top of that, you don't have to worry about whether you can find good fresh tomatoes, e.g. if it's winter and they're out of season.Your two cases for comparison seem to overlook this: if you just chop and cook, you'll have skin and seeds in your sauce, as well as excess liquid to cook down, while if you use passata, you won't. (Also, for what it's worth, you'd need pretty giant tomatoes to get the equivalent of 3/4 cup of passata out of one tomato.)Of course, if you don't mind skin and seeds, it's also perfectly fine to simply cook fresh tomatoes and be done with it.Note that you can often get similar advantages from other canned tomato products. In the US, crushed tomatoes are far more common, and a roughly similar texture. (Peeled whole tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste can also be useful depending on what texture you're aiming for.)  <sep>  Q: What exactly is Passata? A: crushed tomatoes  Q: Is it better to use Passata instead of fresh tomatoes?

A: f you don't want skin and seeds in your sauce, then you have to do some work to avoid it  Q: Fresh is usually better; however, is it really just a matter of convenience or is the taste effected?

The only thing to keep in mind is that duck feet, like any other duck parts, are substantially more fatty than their chicken equivalents, so assuming you want a clear or mostly-clear stock, you'll have to spend a lot of time skimming.Alternatively you can clean the feet and other bones by boiling them in plain water for 5-10 minutes, then dumping it all out and starting over - which is what your linked recipe suggests. I don't usually do this for brown stocks because you lose a lot of flavour, but if you're starting from raw then it won't make much difference and it's an easy/lazy way to get rid of a lot of the fat at once. <sep> Q: Can I use duck feet to make duck stock A: The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet  Q: Does it add the same flavor and mouth feel?

input: CONTEXT: One of your possible answers is pretty close to what I think is the correct one. To flavor carnitas all the way through, put them back in the braising liquid that has been reduced since cooking the pork. You can create a kind of glaze out of the braising liquid, and toss the shredded pork in that (defat the braising liquid before reducing it).BTW, I never fry carnitas. I may throw them on a greased grill, but I never deep or shallow fry them.  <sep>  Q: How can I get my flavorings to flavor my carnitas all the way through the pork?

input: CONTEXT: Venison is, generally, an extremely lean meat. This means it responds well to two cooking methods: very very fast and very very hot (grilling, perhaps roasting with a lot of basting, or lard the meat first), or very very slow and moist (braising). This is of course dependent on the cut; loin is best grilled, shoulder is best braised (due to the connective tissue), leg is best roasted.I wouldn't use plain water as a braising liquid. 50/50 water and red wine, or stock and wine, or just stock... cider would be lovely, so would various juices.  <sep>  Q: How do I get good results with marinaded venison?###I had some deer ragout and let it marinade one day in wine, brandy and with some spices. ###Then I added some fresh vegetables, cold water and put the heat on. Let it simmer for a couple of hours. The result was OK, but not great (and don't we all aspire for greatness?)###How can I improve on this technique?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: It really depends on your audience and setting. With a Filipino Lechon, it's served communally and eaten as pulled pork, so it's expected that you'll just plunk it down on a side table, and people will crack through the crisp, almost hard, skin and pull servings for themselves with tongs or forks. And they'll go for the whole thing, skin, ears, jowls and all (most people I know don't eat the ears, but they may crunch the crispy skin off them).A similar thing is done with a country-style hog roast. Those may be skinned before serving, but generally you're responsible for pulling or slicing what you want right off the hog (and usually throwing it on a cheapo burger bun). In both of these settings there are almost always some people who don't want to dig right into the pig out of squeamishness or out of fear of getting some part that's not nice to eat. The good host will periodically pull some of the good stuff onto a platter for those folks.If you're doing something more formal, I guess you'd want to section it like Foodrules suggests.  <sep>  Q: How do I serve a whole pig?

input: CONTEXT: In most wheat-based recipes, gluten strands are formed while you work the dough. If you don't rest the dough, rolling can be more difficult and you may get a tougher texture in the final product.Additionally, refrigerating the dough up to a certain point will firm up the fats in the recipe (butter, etc), which will make the dough less mushy and will making rolling out the dough evenly a bit easier.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I've never tried steaming bok choy, but yes, the ribs and leafy bits cook at different speeds.For stir frys I trim the bottom so the ribs come free, clean off any dirt that's gotten trapped in between, then stack up the leaves and cut the leaves from the ribs. I slice the ribs into about 5mm / 3/16"" slices, and add them towards the end; the leaves I cut into ribbons (perpendicular to the ribs), and stir them in at the last second, so they barely cook. The center I just chop the top off the leafy bit, and slice the more rib-like bits a litte larger than the rest of the ribs (they're thinner, so cook faster).As I've never tried steaming it, and I don't tend to cook in bags (except for silver turtles when camping), this is going to be a complete guess. Now, it tastes fine al dente, so you could leave the ribs as large as I use for a stir fry, but en papillote tends to be fancier cooking, so I'd probably try for maybe 1/6"" slices or a little thicker (maybe 2-3mm), and if you had a mandoline so they all came out even, that'd be great. I'd still cut the leaves into ribbons, just because it's easier to eat than a huge intact leaf.I'd assume that the leaves would cook at a similar rate as spinich, and the ribs closer to fennel, if that helps at all.  <sep>  Q: How should I prepare Bok Choy before I cook it? A: For stir frys I trim the bottom so the ribs come free, clean off any dirt that's gotten trapped in between, then stack up the leaves and cut the leaves from the ribs  Q: Are the leaves usable?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: A bunch of spinach usually weighs something like 250-500 grams. My best guess is that something like half that is the stems, which can easily be as long as the leaves. So very roughly, I'd say a bunch is 125-250 grams. Alternately, if you want to go by volume (e.g. if your store has bulk loose baby spinach), think of a bunch as something like a head of lettuce, except with the bottom third to half mostly stems.Full-size spinach also definitely gets a lot better than 4x6 cm leaves, so you may still be using somewhat more tender baby spinach,Â but that of course won't cause you any problems. (The stems on baby spinach are tender enough to eat, especially when blending, so you can use everything in your bags.)In any case, smoothies are really forgiving - not only do you not need a lot of precision, but you can just add and blend until the color and flavor look how you want!  <sep>  Q: How much is a bunch of spinach?

input: CONTEXT: Beans freeze marvelously. I put mine in freezer bags and lay them flat so they freeze quickly and are easier to thaw.They are very sturdy little nuggets of joy and hold up well to canning or freezing without getting mushy.Different beans behave differently. Pintos soften quickly and don't have much of a skin. Black beans keep their shape and skin a lot longer. Kidney beans are in the middle- if you boil them too long they will mash but they are a lot sturdier than pintos.  <sep>  Q: Can you preserve canned kidney beans so that they still have their shape?

input: CONTEXT: No, the fat will not render at about 50 C (122 F).However, you said core temperature, which implies the surface temperature will be higher assuming you are not cooking in a 50 C oven (which you should not, for safety reasons). If you are pre-cooking the steak at, for example 120 C (250 F), the surface will be hotter by the time the center reaches your target temperature, so you may get some rendering.Still, there is a quite simple answer: trim the excess fat. What remains should char and develop a good flavor when you sear it on the grill.  <sep>  Q: When I cook a steak, will the fats render if it is slow cooked at low temps?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I would use any uncolored brandy made from distilled fruit. Himbeergeist, sliwowitz, or what you can lay your hands on. Kirsch doesn't taste much like cherries, and I suspect that it functions more as a solvent for some of the aroma in the spices than for adding its own taste. Even though it does contribute a bit, the taste will be subtle, and other slight fruity notes from a different fruit brandy will blend with the heavy spices just as well. In a pinch, you could use a colored brandy too, like Chantre. But it will add more of its own flavor, and while it can make a good combination, it will be further from the original than a random obstwasser.

input: CONTEXT: Empirically, you could use a salinity meter-- one that is made for checking salt water fish tanks. The only other thing I can think of that would drive seasoning into the meat would be cooking in a pressure cooker.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: It is hard to tell from the picture, but this doesn't look like burned off seasoning, it is more like a burned on residue. If that's the case, you can try cleaning it some way. The problem is that physical cleaning methods probably won't be sufficient, chemical cleaning with alkali will damage the seasoning and chemical cleaning with acid, if the seasoning is compromised, can rust the pan a bit. So there is a high chance you will end up reseasoning. If this really looks and feels like a buildup and not like exposed oxidised metal, my preference would be to soak in warm, not hot, acid. Vinegar or a citric acid solution should work well. Afterwards, try to scrub off with a stiff plastic brush. If it doesn't go away, or the seasoning goes away too, or if this was missing seasoning from the beginning, you have to strip and reseason. We have several questions on the topic, and the Internet is also full of suggestions. I personally prefer doing it with lye (best results, strips both old seasoning and rust), owners of self-cleaning ovens like incinerating it, and there are a list of other methods to work with.  <sep>  Q: How do I recover from overheating my cast-iron skillet? A: It is hard to tell from the picture, but this doesn't look like burned off seasoning, it is more like a burned on residue.

input: CONTEXT: You are probably stirring the pudding too much. Cornstarch starts thickening at about 205Â°F/95Â°C. Once the pudding has got to that point and has thickened, stop stirring, otherwise you will interfere with the starch formation that causes the thickening. Using electric beaters probably means you are missing the point when the pudding has thickened and quickly beating the living daylights out of any starch formation that has occurred.It may also be the case that you are beating so much air into the pudding that it just doesn't get hot enough to activate the cornstarch in the first place.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I'm not a professional fudger, but here is my theory: one should add it to the boiling mixture. The reason is that butter has milk solids that are said to âburnâ at low temperatures (somewhere in the range 120C-150C or 250F-300F) which just above the soft ball stage (113C or 235F) needed for making fudge. I interpret the burning to mean that those milk solids (sugars and proteins) get a chance to contribute to the Maillard reaction that gives caramel (and its grained cousin the fudge) its great and rich flavor. Given how unique and varied the flavors arising from butter are, I would not want to miss their contribution by adding them after the heat is gone.  <sep>  Q: How is butter used in fudge? A: one should add it to the boiling mixture  Q: My main question here is Why do some recipes put the butter ON the fudge once its hot whereas the professional videos (i.e. youtube mackinac fudge shops) seem to show the butter in the boiling mix?

input: CONTEXT: My understanding is that what many people call white chili would be considered a green chile stew in a place like New Mexico. It's not red in color because it doesn't have any significant amount of dried red chile in it--it gets whatever heat and chile flavor it has from green chile, which doesn't color the stew significantly.As to defining chili, I think you could work on a definition forever. Apart from the notion that a chile is the pepper, which is the main ingredient, and chili is the dish, I don't like to define it too carefully (of course, New Mexicans think the dish is chile too, but what they have is different from Texas chili, even when they use red chiles). I think chili is a stew, though. Most stew isn't chili, but all chili is stew. And I believe that for most people to accept what you're making as chili, it would have to include a significant dose of dried red chile powder.So if you can accept the validity of white chili at all, and what you're making has almost all green chiles and very little red chile, then I'd say you're making a white chili. Or a green chile stew--which would be my preferential term in this case.  <sep>  Q: What makes white chili white?

If that's the case, plunge the mold into an ice bath, but don't completely submerge it.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: It sounds very much like you didn't manage to completely dissolve the sugar. It's also possible to get a bad texture from ice crystals in your ice cream, but I don't think you'd describe it as gritty or sandy, just icy.It can be rather difficult to dissolve that much sugar in liquid, especially if it's cold straight from the fridge. You might want to try heating it gently and stirring, and being careful to go until there's no undissolved sugar hiding at the bottom. That does make the chilling take a bit longer, probably more like 4-8 hours or overnight, not just 1-2 hours. But in my experience heating to dissolve is pretty much standard in ice cream recipes, presumably because it's about the only way to do it easily.  <sep>  Q: My homemade ice cream texture is gritty/sandy, any advice?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Mast O Khiar, as you mention mainly consist of plain yogurt and cucumbers and most recipe do not require much more than that. Because of such, the shelf life for the yogurt product will be the shelf life of the yogurt itself. If it is a store bought yogurt, then the shelf life should be about 2 weeks in the refrigerator.Make sure to store the sauce in an air-tight container. Most tubberware should work. Those soup containers from Chinese takeout orders work perfectly.EDIT: After a bit of a debate in cooking chat, I decided to change my answer a little. The reason I said 2 week is because personally I had eaten 2 week old Mast O Khiar. However it could be recipe dependant so it could be different for a different recipe. However it is very easy to tell whether yogurt OR cucumber is bad.Mast O Khiar should have a very fresh/clean aroma. When yogurt turn bad, it releases a rancid smell. If it smells bad, dont eat it.If you see fuzzy mold it's a good idea to throw it out.  <sep>  Q: What is the shelf life of a yogurt product?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Gumbo is a creolized (blending of different cultures) dish that was really a way of making use of many whatever might be on hand. The word ""Gumbo"" itself comes from the African Bantu tribal language which uses the word ""Ngambo"" for okra. In the plantation culture of the south ""ngambo"" became ""gumbo"" and eventually came to be the word for a soup containing okra. In the deep south of South Carolina and southern Georgia it typically has Okra in it to provide thickening from the mucilaginous substance secreted from the okra.As people moved westward toward the Louisiana region they adopted the Choctaw Indian method of using ground sassafras leaves (gumbe file) as the preferred thickening method in that area. Sidenote: Gumbo file is considered to be the only indigenous north American spice.Without knowing what it is that you've been disappointed with, it's difficult to make suggestions. As with so many regional dishes there are certain consistencies but more often than not...more variations. This is one of those items where there isn't necessarily ONE primary method.Some gumbos use a roux for added depth of flavor, color, and thickening while others are more broth based.The main consistency is that it is typically served ladled over rice.  <sep>  Q: What is Gumbo?

One that recirculates is not sufficient.In my experience, the recirculator hoods work OK if you're not doing a lot of cooking. If you do, however, you'll end up with a nasty, greasy dusty coating on everything in your kitchen. I wouldn't bother with a recirculation hood if you ever cook things that involve grease or smoke.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I'm sorry to say this, but I think prevention is the best answer. Once you're vegetables freeze things happen at the cellular level that changes the nature of the vegetables. For example, ice crystals pierce cell walls which destroys some of the structure, which is responsible for the crispness and crunch of the vegetable. I don't think there is really a way to ""fix"" this, once it happens.That said, cooking does something similar to vegetables. Cooking destroys cell walls, which is why cooked carrots are so much softer than raw carrots. I would think that vegetables that stand up to cooking would survive freezing the best (such as your mushrooms). On the other hand, somthing like lettuce is a lost cause, once frozen.  <sep>  Q: How do I recover vegetables that get ""refrigerator crisper chill""?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Some of your 'shortcuts' are not good ideas. Definitely start with cold water. Definitely bring up the temp slowly. Definitely do not boil. Do add aromatics upfront to the broth, but remove them as they get mushy so they don't cloud it.Standard ratio for beef broth would be: 8 pounds of bones to 6 quarts of water to 1 pound of veggies (onion, leek, carrot) to one 'boquet garni', essentially garlic, rosemary, anise flavoring for pho, and bay leaf, plus whatever else I forgot.If you have 'pond water', which I interpret as thin-tasting, you probably put too much water in the second time -- this is fixable by slowly evaporating out the water until it gets to a good texture. If you skimmed properly, it will be clear as you do this. I will typically strain through a kitchen towel or cheesecloth as the liquid evaporates down.I'm guessing you put in like a gallon of water, so you had like three or four times too much water.As a warning which you probably already know, you are not going to be able to duplicate your local pho joint's broth -- the broth recipe is the thing for pho makers, and they probably have a bunch of tricks they use, including using a neverending supply of yesterdays pho, that you won't be able to do at home. That said, you should be able to get a good beef broth if you follow some basic rules for making stock.  <sep>  Q: My beef broth is not coming out right, how do I properly make beef pho broth?

input: CONTEXT: The answer depends on where you live, and what type you have brought.In many countries that import chickpeas they heat treat them to kill seed-borne diseases and insects. The heat treatment process makes them more difficult to cook, and soaking times double or triple.Beans from exporters with phytosanitary certificates can be imported without heat treatment; these are the ones you want to get.I don't think you can tell which is which by looking at them. At the moment we have some particularly dark, dry, and dead looking beans that soak up beautifully in 8 hours!Soak non-heat treated beans for 8 to 12 hours, heat treated beans for 24 to 36 hours. Some overly heat treated beans will never fully revive, and you are best to return these to the shop as ""faulty"".Soak and cook without salt, unless you are going to mash them. They fall apart more readily if salted.If you are not mashing them, the secret to great chickpea taste is after soaking and cooking in water, is to lightly fry them with a little olive oil until dark spot appear, keep them or the pan moving so none burn. Then add the sauce, or add them to whatever dish you are preparing.  <sep>  Q: How should I prepare dried chickpeas?###I've never used dried chickpeas before, but I'm not wanting for chickpea recipes.

input: CONTEXT: There are many variables here that may or may not caused OP's problem.The Pan sounds as it might not have been hot enough. How hot was quite hot, how long could you hover your hand above the pan? Did you notice any change to the oil once you added it to the pan, did it streak, did it start to smoke?[Personally I tend to oil the meat before placing into the pan.]I think the main flaw is the frying for a minute on each side, at the temperature you had, that cooking time was too low. Maybe 2-4 minutes on each side. A medium should have a lot more heat penetrate the edges and allow that heat to transfer and cook the steak off the heat.That's an acceptable blue/rare steak though.  <sep>  Q: What happened to my steak?

input: CONTEXT: As already mentioned in comments above, this is quite a complex mixture with equally complex set of properties to balance. However, if you are just looking at it as a simple binary system with water as the solvent and various sugars as solutes, one at a time, then there is a very simple answer (not necessarily useful alone).For dilute solutions, freezing point depression is primarily driven by the solvent and not so much the solute, and the relationship is linear. For sugars, Freezing Point Depression (Â°C) = 1.86 * MM is mass/molecular-mass of whichever sugar you use in 1000ml of water. For your example of 10g of sucrose in 100ml water, M is 0.29 and your freezing point is minus 0.5C.For disaccharides like sucrose and lactose, they have identical molecular mass of 342. For simple sugars like glucose and fructose (dextrose is just d-glucose), it is 180. For inverted syrup, you have a mixture. For polyalcohols, you can look up their masses easily.I would still advise against using this sort of tool alone for icecream making.Separately, sweetness is less about just dry mass but molar concentration, which is why inverted syrup is sweeter than sucrose, 1 unit of sucrose in the same amount of water is less sweet than if it was broken into their constituent mono-saccharide glucose and fructose; instead of 1 unit of sucrose, you have 1 unit of glucose and 1 unit of fructose, double the concentration.  <sep>  Q: What is the Impact of different sugar types (and substitutes) on ice cream?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: A pizza stone in a normal oven will only get the maximum temperature of the oven (probably not more than 280 ÂºC / 530 ÂºF).A specific pizza oven will gett hotter (the one you linked gets 390 ÂºC / 735 ÂºF and, indeed has a stone inside).If you want to get Italian style pizzas, go for the pizza oven. They need that high temperature in order to be ready in (ideally) 90 seconds. Those Ferrari ovens are one of Italian's favourite ones, albeit they'll need a bit more time than 1.5 minutes achievable in wood fired traditional pizza ovens. You (probably) won't be able to achieve those high temperatures with a normal home kitchen oven, unless you have a pyrolytic home oven, and hack it in order to cook in it during the pyrolysis cycle.As for the waiting time between pizzas using a stone, consider it as a capacitor (or a rechargeable battery): It takes heat (until is soaked up), and then gives it back. Once you make 1 pizza (or a loaf of bread), it needs to soak (a bit) again.  <sep>  Q: Differences between the oven stone and the pizza oven?

input: CONTEXT: We have a convection oven and almost always use it. I can't remember the last time we didn't use convection. Our model automatically decreases the temperature, so if you set it for 300, then it will heat to 275. Not sure if that is a magic 25 degree number, but it seems to work. Almost all recipes cook time wise as they would with a non-convection oven. Our also has a single and multi-rack mode, and it circulates the air differently in that case. We have NEVER had any problems with the food drying out more with the air circulation as they say that is a common negative.I am sure the effectiveness varies oven to oven, but in our case, we always use it (except for broiling of course).  <sep>  Q: I think I understand what convection does, and (some) of the benefits, such as eliminating hot/cold spots, and being more efficient overall.

input: CONTEXT: What to doA dough should be generally risen by size anyway, not by time. But it is also very forgiving, so it will probably still give you decent edible bread if you do it by time. The best way is to wait until it has doubled, no matter what the clock shows. But you insist on going by the clock, don't change the time, wait the 30 minutes. It may be underproofed (with such a short time given by the recipe, there is virtually no chance of overproofing it), but the same would have happened if you were using the original amounts and going by the clock. Dough proofing and timeThe rising time for dough at room temperature is not affected by recipe scaling, the time it takes a specific dough to double will be the same regardless of the size of your batch. If the temperature in your proofing container is significantly different from the dough temperature, you will see some effect on rising times with different batch sizes and dough shapes, as the center of the dough will need some time to get to the same temperature as the proofing container, and warmer dough rises quicker than cold dough. This is unlikely to have a measurable effect at dough amounts used by home bakers, especially considering that the possible proofing temperature window is rather narrow.  <sep>  Q: How does halving a bread recipe impact rising time? A: the time it takes a specific dough to double will be the same regardless of the size of your batch  Q: Would doubling or tripleing the recipe make it to heavy to rise as fast? A: If the temperature in your proofing container is significantly different from the dough temperature, you will see some effect on rising times with different batch sizes and dough shapes  Q: So the temperature will effect the rising time? A: warmer dough rises quicker than cold dough  Q: Is there a suggested temperature to proof your bread at? A: room temperature  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Does it matter if you cover the bread with plastic wrap or not?

Infusing oil with chilli won't change its cooking properties, and both those oils will store fine long-term. If you are going to go for a cold infusion then it's highly recommended that you dry your chillies first so you get a long lasting result. If you don't dry them they will get mushy and rot in the oil, which isn't very pleasant. Drying them in your oven will stink up your house big-time, but it's worth it. Alternatively you can make chili strings with them and they will air dry, or you can freeze them for years and they'll stay good.  <sep>  Q: Can I Appropriate oil to infuse with hot chillies?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: It really depends on your audience and setting. With a Filipino Lechon, it's served communally and eaten as pulled pork, so it's expected that you'll just plunk it down on a side table, and people will crack through the crisp, almost hard, skin and pull servings for themselves with tongs or forks. And they'll go for the whole thing, skin, ears, jowls and all (most people I know don't eat the ears, but they may crunch the crispy skin off them).A similar thing is done with a country-style hog roast. Those may be skinned before serving, but generally you're responsible for pulling or slicing what you want right off the hog (and usually throwing it on a cheapo burger bun). In both of these settings there are almost always some people who don't want to dig right into the pig out of squeamishness or out of fear of getting some part that's not nice to eat. The good host will periodically pull some of the good stuff onto a platter for those folks.If you're doing something more formal, I guess you'd want to section it like Foodrules suggests.  <sep>  Q: What is the best process to serve a whole pre-cooked pig I got from the butchers? A: It really depends on your audience and setting  Q: Is there a lot of butchering involved?

input: CONTEXT: It's safe because freezing greatly slows (if not completely arrests) the growth of the bacteria that would otherwise make the meat spoil. It doesn't kill them, it just puts them in 'stasis'. The expiration date is given based on the meat only being refrigerated. If you intend to store the meat past its expiration date, best practice is to freeze the meat ASAP, and to use it within 24 hours of defrosting.The main hazard is in that defrosting. At no point should the chicken (any part thereof) be at room temperature for more than 2 hours. The safest method is to defrost the meat slowly in the fridge. You can also defrost it under cold running water, providing you keep it under the 2 hour mark.Of course, you can also cook the meat straight from frozen. There is absolutely nothing wrong with doing this for small cuts like chicken breasts. Slicing and cooking a partially defrosted chicken breast is perfectly safe, especially as it often easier to make really thin strips with semi-solid meat. You just have to be extra careful that the meat is at a safe temperature (170Â°F/75Â°C).  <sep>  Q: Why is expired frozen chicken safe to eat? A: It's safe because freezing greatly slows (if not completely arrests) the growth of the bacteria that would otherwise make the meat spoil  Q: Are there any food safety hazards to watch out for when defrosting expired frozen chicken? A: The main hazard is in that defrosting. At no point should the chicken (any part thereof) be at room temperature for more than 2 hours  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Thank you for the information. How long can expired chicken be kept in the freezer?

Infusing oil with chilli won't change its cooking properties, and both those oils will store fine long-term. If you are going to go for a cold infusion then it's highly recommended that you dry your chillies first so you get a long lasting result. If you don't dry them they will get mushy and rot in the oil, which isn't very pleasant. Drying them in your oven will stink up your house big-time, but it's worth it.

input: CONTEXT: If your chicken burns, the issue is likely not that you cooked it too long, but that you cooked it too hot.

input: CONTEXT: It was timing. If you want to make chocolate meringues, add the cocoa powder to the liquid egg whites, and then whisk it all together at once. Beaten egg whites are bubbles. Don't add things to an already-formed meringue, as they will just cause the bubble structure to collapse.Ever sprinkled sugar or cinnamon powder on a cappuccino?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: There's no particular reason you couldn't prepare a stock with something other than water, but it's the equivalent of buying a ream of heavy pink paper, rather than plain white photocopy paper. If that's the effect you really want, great. The thing is, stock is meant to be as boring as plain white photocopy paper -- it is a foundation for other things, versatile and effective, subtly enhancing without overwhelming the dish. For your beer idea, for example, I would cook down a couple bottles and add some stock to it. That way, the rest of my batch of stock would be useful for other recipes that don't use beer.Note that stock may be boring but shouldn't be flavorless; stock still should taste good. If your stock was flavorless, try upping the amount of meat, veggies, and herbs compared to bones. Also, bear in mind that stock should not contain salt (you will likely reduce the stock at some point). The lack of salt, however, will deaden the flavor. When you are ready to use the stock, be sure to add a pinch of salt.  <sep>  Q: Can I use other liquid than water when making stock? A: There's no particular reason you couldn't prepare a stock with something other than water  Q: Would it be weird to use lager?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Flour (+ water, either directly or from other ingredients such as egg white) gives the pastry structure. As you knead the flour, the gluten network develops and results in elasticity. When cooked, water evaporates from the dough leaving a rigid gluten skeleton. Fat does not mix with water and thus stay in blobs in between the gluten network. This weakens the gluten structure, making the pastry crumble.For this reason, you often see in recipes for shortcrust to avoid overmixing the fat. Buttery biscuits such as shortbread crumble more than crackers, which have more water. The same rationale applies to puff pastry. The thin fat layers are impermeable, so water steam gets trapped and exercise pressure upwards, lifting the pastry up.Quoting @GdD in the comments, the punchline is:more fat = crumblier, less fat has more structure.  <sep>  Q: How does altering the fat-to-flour ratio affect the pastry? A: Fat does not mix with water and thus stay in blobs in between the gluten network. This weakens the gluten structure, making the pastry crumble  Q: Is it better to be dry or gooey?

input: CONTEXT: Anything susceptible to moisture will go stale if exposed to air long enough. Storage will only get you so far, depending on the temperature and humidity in the storage area. In a restaurant kitchen, I don't have to tell you that both are rather high.I'd suggest blanching them after cutting. You could basically cook them through then store them in a relatively air-tight container for a period of several days. When a customer orders chips you'd just drop the blanched chips in the deep fryer long enough to brown and crisp them. This is what essentially every restaurant outfit that serves chips and/or french fries does and it works well.

A: more fat = crumblier, less fat has more structure  Q: Is it only crumblier after it bakes?

input: CONTEXT: Yes, nuts are very fatty, and they will eventually go rancidâ if this is the case, they will taste very poor. They can also dry out, or in more rare cases (especially if stored improperly) be infested with insects or molds.Generally, they should be good for six months to a year at their best flavor, depending on the variety (in the shell).Five years is a little long.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Actually I would disagree to some extent with the other two answers - I think you can use creme fraiche instead. I agree with MStodd that it will certainly give a different flavour and texture to the sauce, but if you're just looking for a healthier base to a pasta sauce, I'd say it's fine to substitute. Also as daniel mentions, you have to be careful not to overheat it (although the same is true of cream), as it will curdle.In my experience, creme fraiche is great to make a very quick and easy pasta sauce. Put it in right at the end of cooking, once everything else is properly cooked and just heat enough so it is warmed through.It comes down to whether you are wanting to achieve the same flavours though - if you are, maybe you could try what I would call single cream (not sure what it would be called in the US), and thicken the sauce with a bit of cornflour mixed with cold water.  <sep>  Q: Can Creme Fraiche be substituted for Heavy Cream in a Cream Sauce? A: it will certainly give a different flavour and texture to the sauce, but if you're just looking for a healthier base to a pasta sauce, I'd say it's fine to substitute  Q: ream Sauce 1 quart heavy cream 1 head garlic, roasted 1/2 teaspoon pepper 2 teaspoons salt 1 cup parmesan cheese A: creme fraiche is great to make a very quick and easy pasta sauce.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Frittata freezes just fine. At least, mine do. There are a couple of drawbacks you might want to take into account when making your recipe, though.One is that the individual tastes of the ingredients all meld together when the frittata gets thawed or reheated, so if you're looking forward to that bite that has a particularly strong taste of, say, asparagus, it's not going to happen. Conversely, if you're looking forward to that bite that doesn't include the taste of green pepper, that's not going to happen, either, if you put it in there. I never use green pepper in frittata; it completely takes over the dish.The other drawback is that some of the moister ingredients will lose water upon thawing or reheating, thus soaking the frittata on the second go-around and giving it an unpleasant, rubbery texture. If you plan to freeze your frittata, consider your ingredients with that in mind, and choose ones that are low-moisture (extra cheese, dried ham, etc.) or pre-cooked to cook out some of the moisture (mushrooms, sweet onion, etc.)  <sep>  Q: Freezing a frittata###I'm hoping to make a frittata to last a few days to take to work for lunch.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: No, the fat will not render at about 50 C (122 F).However, you said core temperature, which implies the surface temperature will be higher assuming you are not cooking in a 50 C oven (which you should not, for safety reasons). If you are pre-cooking the steak at, for example 120 C (250 F), the surface will be hotter by the time the center reaches your target temperature, so you may get some rendering.Still, there is a quite simple answer: trim the excess fat. What remains should char and develop a good flavor when you sear it on the grill.  <sep>  Q: When I cook a steak, will the fats render if it is slow cooked at low temps?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: It is hard to tell from the picture, but this doesn't look like burned off seasoning, it is more like a burned on residue. If that's the case, you can try cleaning it some way. The problem is that physical cleaning methods probably won't be sufficient, chemical cleaning with alkali will damage the seasoning and chemical cleaning with acid, if the seasoning is compromised, can rust the pan a bit. So there is a high chance you will end up reseasoning. If this really looks and feels like a buildup and not like exposed oxidised metal, my preference would be to soak in warm, not hot, acid. Vinegar or a citric acid solution should work well. Afterwards, try to scrub off with a stiff plastic brush. If it doesn't go away, or the seasoning goes away too, or if this was missing seasoning from the beginning, you have to strip and reseason. We have several questions on the topic, and the Internet is also full of suggestions. I personally prefer doing it with lye (best results, strips both old seasoning and rust), owners of self-cleaning ovens like incinerating it, and there are a list of other methods to work with.  <sep>  Q: How do I recover from overheating my cast-iron skillet?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: It could be the proving time or the oven temperature or both.In hotter climates, bread dough will rise faster. Poking the dough will not harm the dough in any way, so don't be afraid to poke the dough. The best way to test if the bread dough has risen enough is by poking it. As for the oven, if the temperature is too low, it can take longer to get additional rise in the oven. What I do, as do many other bread bakers, is to bake the bread at the hottest temperature it can reach for the first ten minutes, then turn it down to the regular temperature for the remainder of the time needed to bake the bread. The hotter temperature initially can result in more oven spring for the bread.  <sep>  Q: what are the Bread Proving Time in Warm Climates?

input: CONTEXT: Don't most cake recipes require mixing dry ingredients first? Well, what's been done has been done.The standard professional chef way of getting lumps out of anything is to pass it through a fine strainer. In your case a standard metal pasta strainer should work. Put the strainer over a bowl, pour the batter in and use the back of a large spoon or ladle to gentle press the batter through. The lumps of sugar will be left over and you can just crush them then.Whipping the batter might work the gluten proteins in the flour which will make for a tough chewy texture.

input: CONTEXT: Your clarification means a lot -- ""baked"" potato in the U.S. tends to be a whole potato cooked on its own, where the insides become fluffy and creamy, and is done with larger starchy white potatoes, or sweet potatoes work well, too.Roasted potatoes, on the other hand, tends to be (in the U.S.) be smaller ""new"" potatoes, waxy potatoes, or even larger starchy potatoes cut up (eg, 'oven fries').The starchy potatoes only really hold up well when roasting if it's very high heat or a short amount of time -- if you're going to be cooking them with the roast as there's going to be moisture in there, I'd go for a waxy potato (eg, Red Bliss).As for the browning -- probably coat them well with oil, and if they're not brown enough for your liking when you pull the roast, as you're going to have to rest it anyway, drain the meat juices, crank the oven up to somewhere around 450F (230C) and leave the potatoes in for a few extra minutes.ps. yes, I know a sweet potato isn't a potato. And I also tend to use Yukon Gold for just about everything, as it makes great baked potatoes, and roasted potatoes (although, not sure how well with a roast at the same time) and they're good in pot roast and stews if you don't add them too early.  <sep>  Q: What are the best potatoes for baking?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Basically, you can refreeze the raspberries.When a fruit or veg. is frozen, the water inside the plant cell expands, and bursts the cell wall, which is why there is so much 'juice' when you thaw. If you refreeze, you can be sure that the raspberries will freeze into a giant block. If you are using them to make a sauce or a jam, this is not significant. That being said, if you are using frozen raspberries in the first place, you are obviously not looking for a perfectly intact raspberry, you are using them for some other purpose. Therefor, refreezing is no big deal. I recently answered another question about freezing and refreezing, and how it is basically a myth that it renders the refrozen product inedible. Any time you freeze you know that you are not going to get 'exactly' the same product when you thaw it, and the same goes with refreezing, there is always a 'slight' degredation of the product with each successive freeze (do you like my liberal usage of quotes?) You won't poison yourself or anything like that, you should have no worries.That being said, what are you doing with the berries? Certainly a refrozen raspberry should be no worse that a raspberry frozen once.  <sep>  Q: Can I re-freeze fruit?

input: CONTEXT: They're good pretty much forever. There is not enough available water for things to grow in there. Mind you, the more aromatic and subtle parts of the flavor will dissipate over time. The sugar absorbs water, giving the combination a very low water activity, meaning there's little water available for microorganisms to use in growth.

It pairs well with a lot of different foods, usually other strong flavors (either strong tart like the spicey mustard, or strong sweet like the thousand island dressing or sweet relish).Personally, I just eat sauerkraut with a fork. But if I have it on a dog, I pile it on with dill relish, country style dijon mustard, a dash of sriracha, and some diced onion.

input: CONTEXT: I'm sorry to say this, but I think prevention is the best answer. Once you're vegetables freeze things happen at the cellular level that changes the nature of the vegetables. For example, ice crystals pierce cell walls which destroys some of the structure, which is responsible for the crispness and crunch of the vegetable. I don't think there is really a way to ""fix"" this, once it happens.That said, cooking does something similar to vegetables. Cooking destroys cell walls, which is why cooked carrots are so much softer than raw carrots. I would think that vegetables that stand up to cooking would survive freezing the best (such as your mushrooms). On the other hand, somthing like lettuce is a lost cause, once frozen.  <sep>  Q: How do I recover vegetables that get ""refrigerator crisper chill""?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: A good quality ($20 or so) sweet Port, Madeira, or Sherry could be lovely, and add a delicious flavor note of its own. Make sure it's something that tastes good by itself, with a flavor that appeals to you, complimenting a piece of cake.Note that these are so-called ""fortified wines"" â they are distilled to a higher alcohol content. Historically, this was done to achieve a long shelf-life without preservatives, so they're more like spirits. Unlike regular ""corked"" wines, an opened bottle of fortified wine can last a long time, so the cork is made as a stopper that can be easily resealed.I don't think you'd get good results with a moscato or such. I also wouldn't skimp and buy a cheap (e.g.: Taylor) bottle of Port â that would be like using cheap, imitation vanilla extract! Spending $30 to get a high-quality flavor that you enjoy, is money well spent.This kind of wine typically comes in both sweet and dry variants. If you're making an entrÃ©e sauce, you probably want a dry wine. For fruitcake, be sure to select a sweet variety. Sometimes, they're not specifically labeled ""dry"" or ""sweet"", so you need to read how it's described the label, or ask your vintner for a recommendation.  <sep>  Q: Can I soak dried fruit in sweet wine instead of liqueur for use in fruitcakes?###The recipes for fruitcake that I've looked at say to soak the dried fruit in brandy, rum, etc., i.e., something with a high alcohol content.### I've been using liqueur which works well. I was wondering if using a sweet wine would work

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Gumbo is a creolized (blending of different cultures) dish that was really a way of making use of many whatever might be on hand. The word ""Gumbo"" itself comes from the African Bantu tribal language which uses the word ""Ngambo"" for okra. In the plantation culture of the south ""ngambo"" became ""gumbo"" and eventually came to be the word for a soup containing okra. In the deep south of South Carolina and southern Georgia it typically has Okra in it to provide thickening from the mucilaginous substance secreted from the okra.As people moved westward toward the Louisiana region they adopted the Choctaw Indian method of using ground sassafras leaves (gumbe file) as the preferred thickening method in that area. Sidenote: Gumbo file is considered to be the only indigenous north American spice.Without knowing what it is that you've been disappointed with, it's difficult to make suggestions. As with so many regional dishes there are certain consistencies but more often than not...more variations. This is one of those items where there isn't necessarily ONE primary method.Some gumbos use a roux for added depth of flavor, color, and thickening while others are more broth based.The main consistency is that it is typically served ladled over rice.  <sep>  Q: What is gumbo?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: In theory chakki is a flour mill, and chakki atta is flour fresh from that mill. Realistically of course nothing you find on your grocery store shelves is fresh from a mill.Atta flour is made from hard wheat, which has a high gluten content. This means that your flour is probably better for bread than typical all-purpose whole wheat flour from the baking aisle. If it is hard white wheat this might explain the color, as ground white wheat doesn't look that much darker than all-purpose flour. Like typical grocery store whole wheat flour, atta flour is coarsely ground. This may give your bread a more grainy texture (not a bad thing), and makes atta unideal for cakes, biscuits, and quick breads unless you like them with a coarse texture in the crumb. If you would like to use whole wheat for baking other than bread, whole wheat pastry flour is the usual suggestion (or grind wheat yourself to a very find grind).  <sep>  Q: Can I use Chakki Atta instead of whole wheat flour?

The only thing to keep in mind is that duck feet, like any other duck parts, are substantially more fatty than their chicken equivalents, so assuming you want a clear or mostly-clear stock, you'll have to spend a lot of time skimming.Alternatively you can clean the feet and other bones by boiling them in plain water for 5-10 minutes, then dumping it all out and starting over - which is what your linked recipe suggests. I don't usually do this for brown stocks because you lose a lot of flavour, but if you're starting from raw then it won't make much difference and it's an easy/lazy way to get rid of a lot of the fat at once. <sep> Q: Can I use duck feet to make duck stock A: The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet  Q: Does it add the same flavor and mouth feel?

input: CONTEXT: For what it's worth, I read once that you should briefly soak seitan in a bowl, covered in boiled water, to soften it up before using it. I have tried this, and it really does make a difference in the final texture. I typically cut it into cubes, soak it for about 10-15 minutes, then drain it and proceeded as normal for the recipe.  <sep>  Q: How to keep baked seitan from being too tough?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: No, bartenders do not shake carbonated beverages. I was a bartender for years and I have never known this to happen or be part of a recipe. The carbonated sodas are always put on the top of the glass after pouring. The foam comes from the sugar or egg whites in the sweet n sour mix. You can find that recipe on line. Here is one that is overly complicated, bars rarely (never to my knowledge) use fresh lemon or lime juice. However a good bar uses separate lemon & lime mix for different drinks, or they used to anyway. I personally use limeade or lemonade at home. You can use one of the other or mix them together. Throw that in a shaker & you will get some foam, it works in my blender.  <sep>  Q: Can I use carbonated drinks in cocktail shakers?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Being Filipino, I totally applaud you for such an excellent choice of an entree. The enemy of all fried food is moisture. Think of...potato chips. Immediately after you fry, make sure you let the food cool at room temperature before packaging. I would store the lechon in a non air-tight container, like a KFC bucket/box with parchment paper. Paper bags are good options as well. After the food has substantially cooled, feel free to refrigerate. Don't put your lechon in a sealed tupperware container while hot, as condensation from water evaporating from the meat while it is hot will often form and make your food soggy.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: It is true, in my experience. However, if your recipe does not require salt, you should not be adding it, of course. Removing moisture from onion with the aid of salt helps it reach its desired state (brown or translucent, as desired) faster.I am most familiar with the use of onion in Indian cooking. I generally add a pinch or two of salt to onion when I start sauteing it. Onion starts sweating as soon as you add salt and start stirring. The reason that salt draws out moisture from onion is osmotic pressure. The surface of the onion acts as a semipermeable membrane barrier. Since the solution outside the onion is more concentrated with respect to salt, water moves out of the onion to the general liquid side, to balance the osmotic pressure on either side of the onion surface.  <sep>  Q: Is there any advantage to adding salt to onion while frying? A: Removing moisture from onion with the aid of salt helps it reach its desired state (brown or translucent, as desired) faster  Q: Why is removing moisture from onion important, for texture? A: helps it reach its desired state (brown or translucent, as desired) faster  Q: So, timing - Is there any advantage to adding salt to onion while frying itself rather than adding it the last? A: Onion starts sweating as soon as you add salt and start stirring  Q: How much salt to add for a medium sized onion? A: add a pinch or two of salt to onion  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Ah, some go heavy, a tablespoon or more, and do you add pepper with?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Yes it should - sort of. Your observation is right on point, a very rich dough will tear more easily. (I did the same experiment once myself.) But it will still show some characteristics of the windowpane test: it will stretch smoothly and the ""pane"" should be very even, not show streaks of thicker and thinner areas. Note that the temperature of your dough and thus the consistency of your fat may have an influence as well. While warm doughs with soft fat will be very stretchy, cool doughs (made with cold ingredients and little yeast for an overnight cold raise) can be less cooperative.If you are familiar with how a ""ready"" non-enriched dough looks that passes the windowpane test, you will probably recognise the same smoothness in an enriched dough anyway, without performing the test. For this specific recipe, I guess it's the very low hydration that makes the windowpane test difficult and the dough prone to tearing, not the fat.  <sep>  Q: Should enriched doughs pass the windowpane test? A: it will still show some characteristics of the windowpane test: it will stretch smoothly and the ""pane"" should be very even  Q: My first attempt didn't, how do I get it to pass this test?

input: CONTEXT: Generally speaking, frying gives a better crust due to the higher direct heat producing more Maillard flavours. A good, heavy, screaming hot pan is required. Oil the steak, not the pan, with vegetable or groundnut oil (olive oil will burn), and baste with butter towards the end for extra flavour.If your steak is thick, you might try a reverse sear - roast the steak at about 150Â°C until the centre is 10Â°C off your desired doneness level (if you don't have a digital probe thermometer, invest the small amount they cost, it is completely worth it), then sear the outside on your mega hot pan. This avoids you having to overdo the outside just to get the inside right.  <sep>  Q: Is it better to fry or grill a steak?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Broth is usually defined as having had bones/meat/veg boiled in it, so the dictionary says no. The lack of flavour also says no, and I doubt reducing it would make much difference. You could use the water to make broth or stock, if you have bones/vegetables to hand.What's more likely to have happened is that condensation dripped into the water. This will always happen unless you take steps to prevent it, as the chicken is cooler than the steam, causing water to condense on the surface (more obvious with steaming green veg). This water dripping would carry small amounts of protein (e.g. myoglobin from dark meat) into the water, and it doesn't take much of many proteins to make water cloudy (this is why milk is white, or a few drops of milk make water cloudy). Small particles of fat will also contribute if they run into the water.  <sep>  Q: Water came out cloudy after steaming chicken, is it cosidered a broth?###I was surprised since the chicken never touched the water but I guess it dropped some of its juices in it, I was doing a small batch and I tried to taste it but after adding some salt it just tasted salty,### so If I make a larger batch in less water and the result comes out more concentrated could this taste good and be considered a broth ? A: What's more likely to have happened is that condensation dripped into the water  Q: Whats considered a broth then? A: Broth is usually defined as having had bones/meat/veg boiled in it  Q: Any suggestions for me? A: You could use the water to make broth or stock, if you have bones/vegetables to hand  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Sounds good. Thanks###What kind of vegetables could i use?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: There are arguments of the universal validity of such rules, but there has long been an argument that reheated meat that was pre-cooked should always be brought to full safe temperature.The general idea is that cooked or not there is bacteria present. If heated to only the 100-120F range, you have reached the temperature of highest active growth of many pathogens, without killing them. Some will argue that this is safe, as long as you eat the item immediately, not let it sit and give time for that bacterial growth to bloom. I would even put credence to this for items which I knew the preparation and handling history, but for prefab type foods, like ground meats and especially poultry, I personally would be reluctant to take risks, I would bring it to temp. There also has always been disclaimers that the reheating to temp rule only applies to if you reheat at all, for instance, medium rare roast beef is often eaten cold as leftover, but the rule stated if you reheat, the reheat to what would have originally be considered a safe temperature, not part way. With something like a prepped burger, again, I personally would not eat it cold, and just thawing it might put you into an unknown zone. I would heat it.  <sep>  Q: Is therea minimum internal temperature for chicken?

input: CONTEXT: Some crabs are better tasting than others. Ornamental crabs, to my knowledge none are inedible, but tend to be very small, and high skin/seed to flesh so tend to be too much trouble to bother with.

They will be tart to very tart and even bitter, but when blended with other juices add what many people consider a very refreshing bite to the juice. Candied crabs and apple butter are commonly made with them and they can be used for jams other applications especially mixed with other apples to increase tartness.There are a wide variations of varieties, just as with full size apples, and some will seem better than other. If they are wild seedling trees rather than grafter varieties, the quality of the fruit may be hit and miss, and even some of the cultivated named varieties may be astringent, especially some which are marketed for their hard cider characteristics where the astringency is desirable.

input: CONTEXT: I probably would not recommend eating a box of baking soda and chasing that with shots of vinegar. But aside from that silliness, I can't think of a single thing that is actual ""food"" that is unsafe mixed with another actual ""food"", assuming reasonable quantities. Certainly anything with alcohol can be dangerous in huge quantities, as can a lot of other ingredients. Allergies or food sensitivities can make certain ingredients dangerous to certain people. But mixing ingredients to which the individual has no special sensitivity and in normal quantities? No, I don't think you are risking anything by doing so other than unpleasant food.  <sep>  Q: How safe is it to combine flavor extracts?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I've struggled with this issue as well because I live in a moist climate and instant espresso powder cakes up on me between uses.Generally recipes which use instant espresso power are trying to add a kick of bitter and roasted flavors to deepen chocolate flavors and make them richer. You can try substituting instant coffee 1:1, but the flavor of the baked good will certainly suffer a loss of richness. Increasing the amount of instant coffee, however, would likely add more bitter or acidic flavors -- and caffeine -- to the cookie or cake than you want. Also, instant coffee takes longer to dissolve, so it needs to be added straight to a liquid.There's no real way to substitute liquid coffee in most recipes, such as chocolate cookie or brownie recipes, because the recipe has no water in it in the first place. In the rare recipes where there is water, you could substitute strong-brewed coffee for an equal quantity of water+espresso powder, and this would likely work fairly well.So, summing up: there's no really good substitute for instant espresso powder in recipes which call for it that I've found with some significant experimentation. Hopefully someone else has had better ideas than me.  <sep>  Q: I love instant espresso but would like know if there are any instant espresso powder substitutions? A: You can try substituting instant coffee 1:1, but the flavor of the baked good will certainly suffer a loss of richness  Q: How would the taste be affected overall? A: Increasing the amount of instant coffee, however, would likely add more bitter or acidic flavors  Q: Do I use the coffee the same way as the espresso powder? A: instant coffee takes longer to dissolve, so it needs to be added straight to a liquid  Q: Can I use the coffee as a substitute in recipes that require espresso powder? A: there's no really good substitute for instant espresso powder in recipes which call for it that I've found with some significant experimentation  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Does it take longer to bake using the alternative?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The raspberries should work if you strain them thoroughly and fold them in very carefully so they don't break apart. Adding the liquid to the cheesecake will noticeably alter the texture, probably making it mushy; note that there aren't any water based ingredients in the recipe which you could substitute raspberry syrup for.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: A good quality ($20 or so) sweet Port, Madeira, or Sherry could be lovely, and add a delicious flavor note of its own. Make sure it's something that tastes good by itself, with a flavor that appeals to you, complimenting a piece of cake.Note that these are so-called ""fortified wines"" â they are distilled to a higher alcohol content. Historically, this was done to achieve a long shelf-life without preservatives, so they're more like spirits. Unlike regular ""corked"" wines, an opened bottle of fortified wine can last a long time, so the cork is made as a stopper that can be easily resealed.I don't think you'd get good results with a moscato or such. I also wouldn't skimp and buy a cheap (e.g.: Taylor) bottle of Port â that would be like using cheap, imitation vanilla extract! Spending $30 to get a high-quality flavor that you enjoy, is money well spent.This kind of wine typically comes in both sweet and dry variants. If you're making an entrÃ©e sauce, you probably want a dry wine. For fruitcake, be sure to select a sweet variety. Sometimes, they're not specifically labeled ""dry"" or ""sweet"", so you need to read how it's described the label, or ask your vintner for a recommendation.  <sep>  Q: Can I soak dried fruit in sweet wine instead of liqueur for use in fruitcakes?###The recipes for fruitcake that I've looked at say to soak the dried fruit in brandy, rum, etc., i.e., something with a high alcohol content.### I've been using liqueur which works well. I was wondering if using a sweet wine would work A: A good quality ($20 or so) sweet Port, Madeira, or Sherry could be lovely, and add a delicious flavor note of its own  Q: Any other suggestions for me?

If that's the effect you really want, great. The thing is, stock is meant to be as boring as plain white photocopy paper -- it is a foundation for other things, versatile and effective, subtly enhancing without overwhelming the dish. For your beer idea, for example, I would cook down a couple bottles and add some stock to it. That way, the rest of my batch of stock would be useful for other recipes that don't use beer.Note that stock may be boring but shouldn't be flavorless; stock still should taste good. If your stock was flavorless, try upping the amount of meat, veggies, and herbs compared to bones. Also, bear in mind that stock should not contain salt (you will likely reduce the stock at some point). The lack of salt, however, will deaden the flavor. When you are ready to use the stock, be sure to add a pinch of salt.  <sep>  Q: Can I use other liquid than water when making stock?

input: CONTEXT: There's no health issue here, the sausages will be cooked enough to be safe. The reason you fry off the sausages first is that you make the casings more edible, get flavor from maillard reactions and browning, and maybe get rid of some of the fat (if you discard the fat that comes out of the sausages that is). I'm thinking that the sausage casings could end up being a bit soggy, however that depends on several factors and you'll probably get a good result. Worst case is you don't eat the sausage casings.  <sep>  Q: Is it okay to slow cook sausage casserole without pan frying the sausages? A: There's no health issue here, the sausages will be cooked enough to be safe  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: What would the cooking time be for 8-8 sausages?

input: CONTEXT: Umami is the result of glutamic acid (ions) getting in touch with the tongue. Glutamic acid in fish sauce is the result of a fermentation process, which involves bacteria doing the work of breaking down fish components. Glutamic acid easily dissolves in water though. This is after all, how it was detected millennia ago and centuries ago verified by creating glutamic acid salts: Cooking seaweed in water and boiling the result down.The wakame is added due to its natural content of glutamic acid. There isn't anything special the pineapple can/has do to it that regular water can't do.Therefore the answer is: No, the purpose of the pineapple is not to increase the glutamic acid of the substitute.  <sep>  Q: How does pineapple affect umami when used in vegan-fish-sauce recipes? A: There isn't anything special the pineapple can/has do to it that regular water can't do  Q: I have seen mushroom and wakame as ingredients in fish sauce substitutes but does pineapple just take the cake?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: That silty precipitate is just a thing that happens when fermenting - it's the yeasts dying off and settling out of the solution. I've seen it with mead, yeast-based soda recipes, and other fermented drinks (like fermented lemonade etc) - your ginger ale would be yeast based soda, by the way, if you drink while fairly young and carbonated, like with a day or two of fermentation (you can have longer storage if not actively fermenting, ie in the fridge where yeasts are nearly dormant or having killed the yeasties off somehow) while it will likely grow increasingly alcoholic if you leave it an extended amount of time.This precipitate isn't a problem, it might be off-putting to see or taste (if you get a whole mouthful) but it isn't harmful and I at least will often drink it because I don't care enough to avoid it, but if you don't like it you can rack the beverage - that is, let it sit still to settle, and gently pour or siphon from the (clearer) top, and stop pouring when just the settled, cloudy yeasty dregs are left. If you're fermenting for an extended period of time (ie, alcohol) these may be racked several times while aging to keep the yeast from building up and possibly introducing off flavors - though its usually a few months between racking, so I wouldn't expect off flavors to develop quickly.  <sep>  Q: I am sorry but I have no idea. I didn't know you could make your own ginger ale.###You learn something new everyday as the old saying goes.

Increasing the amount of instant coffee, however, would likely add more bitter or acidic flavors -- and caffeine -- to the cookie or cake than you want. Also, instant coffee takes longer to dissolve, so it needs to be added straight to a liquid.There's no real way to substitute liquid coffee in most recipes, such as chocolate cookie or brownie recipes, because the recipe has no water in it in the first place. In the rare recipes where there is water, you could substitute strong-brewed coffee for an equal quantity of water+espresso powder, and this would likely work fairly well.So, summing up: there's no really good substitute for instant espresso powder in recipes which call for it that I've found with some significant experimentation. Hopefully someone else has had better ideas than me.  <sep>  Q: I love instant espresso but would like know if there are any instant espresso powder substitutions? A: You can try substituting instant coffee 1:1, but the flavor of the baked good will certainly suffer a loss of richness  Q: How would the taste be affected overall? A: Increasing the amount of instant coffee, however, would likely add more bitter or acidic flavors  Q: Do I use the coffee the same way as the espresso powder? A: instant coffee takes longer to dissolve, so it needs to be added straight to a liquid  Q: Can I use the coffee as a substitute in recipes that require espresso powder? A: there's no really good substitute for instant espresso powder in recipes which call for it that I've found with some significant experimentation  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Is there any other substitutions other than coffee?

input: CONTEXT: What gives spices their flavors are the oils that they contain, along with any water soluble flavors that they might have. In a pressure cooker, your food will cook hot. What that means to your spices will vary as certain spices could grow more bitter or sweeter depending on the compounds inside them. Conventional wisdom says that pressure cooking concentrates the flavors, although that would seem to fly in the face of physics as you aren't reducing while pressure cooking, you are just heating steam at a higher atmosphere to transfer more heat to the food faster.As for texture, use the one that you like.  <sep>  Q: what is the difference between cooking vegetable curries in a pressure cooker and a wok?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I suspect it depends what kind of cheese the whey came from. Whey has all of the water soluble components of the milk. It loses the casein and fat. How much of the albumin and lactose it loses depends on the cheese. If the milk was heated enough (190F I believe) then the albumin will denature and not be in the whey. If the cheese was acidified with a bacterial inoculation then the bacteria will have converted some of the lactose into lactic acid which will both be in the whey. Riboflavin is water soluble and is what gives the whey that greenish tint.Either way- most of the nutrients that bacteria like are not in the whey and it is always highly acidic. I have personally kept whey for a couple weeks with no ill effect.I usually use my whey soon by making ricotta. If the cheese it came from didn't denature the albumin in the milk then you can gently heat the whey until the the albumin precipitates out. A gallon of whole milk makes almost a pound of mozzarella and then a little less than a cup of ricotta. That's a lasagna right there.  <sep>  Q: What is the storage life for whey?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: In the fridge, an hour should not be a problem, but could still end up bitter depending on the kind of onion used. Usually, Marinades, Pestos etc. that use mashed onions and/or garlic taste best if they are made the way the name ""Pesto"" suggests: Cutting stuff very fine, then using a mortar and pestle. Most explanations WHY that is the case have to with the fact that blenders tend to disintegrate cell walls with relatively rough cuts of a fast but half-sharp or blunt blade, releasing more enzymes etc. from the cell walls as opposed to from the cell contents. These are plausible, since some of the compounds in different parts of onion cells are known to actively react when the onion is disintegrated.Also, try adding oil (which you often want in a marinade anyway. No unrefined olive oil in a blender, though - that is known to get bitter!) while mortaring or blending - this will help extract flavor compounds and probably provide some oxidation protection.There is a well known marinade working with onions, garlic etc: Bulgogi marinade.  <sep>  Q: How long can blended onions stay relatively fresh?

input: CONTEXT: There is not really a turning point. The way that wine goes bad is the process of making vinegar. From wikipedia:The word ""vinegar"" derives from the Old French vin aigre, meaning ""sour wine"".The Canadian government limits things that can be sold as 'vinegar' to something with an acetic acid content of 4-12%, so you could do the technical-bureaucratic thing and wait for the acetic acid to get up to 4%.If you aren't hung up on technicalities, then you can use it as soon as it gets sour enough. It is done when all the alcohol has been changed to acetic acid, but it is a bit hard to taste since the acetic flavor dominates.  <sep>  Q: When is homemade wine-based vinegar simply bad wine?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The primary reason is definitely convenience. If you don't want skin and seeds in your sauce, then you have to do some work to avoid it. Yes, it's possible, e.g. passing through a food mill, or blanching and peeling plus retaining only the flesh, but having it already done is a whole lot easier.Passata is usually much thicker too, so it won't need as long a cooking time to reduce into a non-watery sauce as fresh tomatoes. On top of that, you don't have to worry about whether you can find good fresh tomatoes, e.g. if it's winter and they're out of season.Your two cases for comparison seem to overlook this: if you just chop and cook, you'll have skin and seeds in your sauce, as well as excess liquid to cook down, while if you use passata, you won't. (Also, for what it's worth, you'd need pretty giant tomatoes to get the equivalent of 3/4 cup of passata out of one tomato.)Of course, if you don't mind skin and seeds, it's also perfectly fine to simply cook fresh tomatoes and be done with it.Note that you can often get similar advantages from other canned tomato products. In the US, crushed tomatoes are far more common, and a roughly similar texture. (Peeled whole tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste can also be useful depending on what texture you're aiming for.)  <sep>  Q: What exactly is Passata?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: As already mentioned in comments above, this is quite a complex mixture with equally complex set of properties to balance. However, if you are just looking at it as a simple binary system with water as the solvent and various sugars as solutes, one at a time, then there is a very simple answer (not necessarily useful alone).For dilute solutions, freezing point depression is primarily driven by the solvent and not so much the solute, and the relationship is linear. For sugars, Freezing Point Depression (Â°C) = 1.86 * MM is mass/molecular-mass of whichever sugar you use in 1000ml of water. For your example of 10g of sucrose in 100ml water, M is 0.29 and your freezing point is minus 0.5C.For disaccharides like sucrose and lactose, they have identical molecular mass of 342. For simple sugars like glucose and fructose (dextrose is just d-glucose), it is 180. For inverted syrup, you have a mixture. For polyalcohols, you can look up their masses easily.I would still advise against using this sort of tool alone for icecream making.Separately, sweetness is less about just dry mass but molar concentration, which is why inverted syrup is sweeter than sucrose, 1 unit of sucrose in the same amount of water is less sweet than if it was broken into their constituent mono-saccharide glucose and fructose; instead of 1 unit of sucrose, you have 1 unit of glucose and 1 unit of fructose, double the concentration.  <sep>  Q: what impact does a sugar have on ice cream?

input: CONTEXT: The professional (read: industrial) solution would be maltodextrin powder. It is rather tasteless, has good solubility in liquids, and doesn't change much texturewise. In homemade spice mixes, the popular filler solution are dried breadcrumbs of a very small size (like breadcrumbs for schnitzel breading). They are noticeable, because the mix gets gritty, but the consensus among those who do it is that this is a feature, not a bug. They could also slightly thicken a wet dish (soup, stew), but present no problem when strewn over dry food. You can also use a nut flour made of nuts without much of an own taste, like apricot kernels or low quality overdried almonds. Again, this will be somewhat gritty, but not as hard as the breadcrumn solution.  <sep>  Q: Hello, I am trying to find an extender/filter for my spice mix. Any recommendations? A: The professional (read: industrial) solution would be maltodextrin powder.

input: CONTEXT: Egg-whites in a carton are usually pasteurized. Pasteurized eggs are not great for meringue because the heat from the pasteurization process negatively affects the proteins in the whites that make for good meringue. With a lot of whipping (and more cream of tartar or other stabilizers) pasteurized egg whites (whether from pasteurized eggs or from cartons) can make meringue though it most likely won't be as stiff as those from non-pasteurized eggs.I would suggest getting regular eggs and trying to use the left-over yolks for something like creme brulee.  <sep>  Q: Can I make meringues with commercial egg whites?

This ripening is achieved by forcing ethylene gas through the bananas in special pressurised rooms.Bananas naturally produce ethylene as they ripen, so you could just put them in a sealable plastic bag to contain that gas. Tomatoes also produce ethylene, so you could pop a couple of those in as well, but be aware that they'll also ripen faster too.  <sep>  Q: How can I speed up banana ripening?### A: Bananas naturally produce ethylene as they ripen, so you could just put them in a sealable plastic bag to contain that gas  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: How long should I leave them?

input: CONTEXT: The most common reason for leakage with Cordon Bleu Chicken is that the packets are too thick, which makes it impossible to get a perfect fold; you need to pound the breasts very thin - less than 1/2"", maybe a little more than 1/4"".The other ""trick"" is to make a small cut along the folded edge of the breast after you fold and seal the packets, which essentially makes it almost like a sandwich; the top and bottom parts can move independently and you don't have tension trying to pull the top piece away.Just don't cut so deep that you cause an immediate leak; if you've pounded the breast to 1/3"" thickness, then your cut should be no more than about 1/8"".If you do it this way, you shouldn't even need to use toothpicks; I never do, and I haven't sprung a single leak in my last 20 or so preparations.  <sep>  Q: How do I stop cheese from leaking out of my cordon bleu chicken?

input: CONTEXT: My own sugar cookie recipe is quite dry as well. It cracks along the edges when pressed or rolled and is easily ""broken"".I've never experienced a problem with the dough being so dry it doesn't take to cookie cutters, but if your dough is literally falling apart you may want to just spritz (or in the absence of a kitchen water spray bottle, sprinkle with your finger tips) cold water on it. (Like adding water to pie dough) Give it one sprinkle/spritz and kneed it in. Repeat until it just stops breaking. Don't go overboard and make it gooey.I'd use water over oil or milk because it's the least likely to change the structure of your cookie in the baking process. Such minuscule amounts of water shouldn't yield a detectable change in the end product.If this is a consistent problem with the recipe, in the future I'd decrease the flour by a tablespoon or two and see if that helps.  <sep>  Q: I am not the best baker, how can I fix my dry crumbly cookie dough?

input: CONTEXT: I am going to guess that you are likely getting british or irish breakfast sausage. The national dutch sausage, Frikandel, is minced, skinless, and not usually eaten at breakfast. There is a perception amongst the dutch that Americans eat nothing but meat and fat in huge portions. I did a semester abroad in the Netherlands. For the first few days, the host family fed me eggs and sausages for breakfast. I usually have some toast or cereal for breakfast. So, after a couple days I asked them if this is what they had for breakfast every day. My host mother said, ""No, this is what we were told Americans have for breakfast everyday!""After a chat, they said they were buying British breakfast sausages and eggs for me. Their typical breakfast was a slice of bread, some cheese, and a very strongly flavored liverwurst. My tastes were not as developed back then. After two days of that I asked if there was any other breakfast choices. My host mother bought me suikerbrood. It is a loaf of bread with sugar baked in it. It was delicious! I told them that I enjoyed this new breakfast very much. This caused a lot of chortling for my two host siblings. It turns out that suikerbrood is a small children's breakfast.  <sep>  Q: Small emulsified breakfast sausages in Dutch countries?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Breads get their structure from glutens--a type of protein formed by the combination of glutenin with gliaten. Kneading and resting the dough helps the formation of glutens--I assume by shifting glutenin and gliatin molecules around, this increases the odds of bindings occurring.Oils can bind to glutenin and gliatin and inhibit these reactions, so fats--oils and butter--definitely play a role in the texture control.It prevents the dough from getting too elastic, which controls texture. This elasticity change would also change the maximum air bubble size. Altering resting times and yeast quantity also change these, but trading off for a different flavor. Oil may play other roles, but these are what I recall reading about off the top of my head. Yes, it does contribute to flavor as well.  <sep>  Q: What is the purpose of oil or butter in bread?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: There is a significant difference in how the two operate.Turkish coffee works by heating the water to a boil, with no added pressure. The coffee, with gronds, is then transferred into a cup to seethe, before drinking.In a mocha pot, pressure will typically rise to as much as 1.5 bar, and the resulting liquid is free of grounds.Given the radically different extraction methods, the end result of the two are likely to be radically different. My experience, taken from memory, follows:Turkish coffee goes through a sequence of mouth feels, from completely clear, to grainy, almost muddy, with coffee grounds. This also affects the flavour of the coffee. At the beginning, it is much like a strong filter brew, but tends to get bitter towards the end of the cup, which is also, in part, why it is traditionally served in very small cups. In addition, it is often spiced with cardamom, and often sweetened with sugar.Coffee from a mocha pot has a consistent mouth feel all the way through the cup, as the grounds are left in the pot. Due to the pressurised extraction, the flavour notes are closer to an espresso than filter coffee.  <sep>  Q: Is there a significant difference between Turkish coffee and Moka pot coffee? A: Given the radically different extraction methods, the end result of the two are likely to be radically different  Q: Since the Turkish coffee and the Moka pot both work by boiling/steaming the coffee, so assuming they are from the same bean, is there a significant difference between the two? A: Coffee from a mocha pot has a consistent mouth feel all the way through the cup, as the grounds are left in the pot  Q: How else would you described the difference between the two?

input: CONTEXT: I'm not sure I've ever seen chipotle paste called for in recipes; I searched around a bit and what I found was consistent with my experience. I saw chipotle en adobo, ground chipotle, and even whole dried chipotle. I also easily found recipes for chipotle en adobo. I don't think you'll have any trouble figuring out what to do with them.The most common way I've seen chipotles, both in grocery stores and in recipes, is chipotle en adobo. You can make your own by simmering dried chipotles in tomato paste with vinegar, garlic, onion (search for recipes if that's not specific enough). I suspect that most chipotle pastes you might find are something like this, but pureed, and possibly cooked until thicker.The other common way to use chipotles is as a powder; that's as easy as grinding them in a spice grinder. If you're using them in something that gets cooked for a decent amount of time, I'd just do this and add them, instead of making chipotle en adobo or a paste out of them.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: 45 minutes of boiling is more than enough time to soften potatoes regardless of altitude.Parboiling potatoes before roasting frees up and gelatinizes starches on the outside of the potatoes that then get nice and crunchy when roasted. It will not do anything useful in your stew.The likely culprit for your potatoes not softening is probably acid.When potatoes are boiled with acid (lemon juice, vinegar, tomatoes, etc) the acid and heat will cause the pectin in the surface of the potatoes to gel. This is sometimes desirable for things like French fries but it can make them too firm in other cases.If your recipe has acidic ingredients you can add them near the end of cooking or at least after the potatoes have had time to soften properly.  <sep>  Q: Is parboiling potatoes going to make them softer in a stew?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: What to doA dough should be generally risen by size anyway, not by time. But it is also very forgiving, so it will probably still give you decent edible bread if you do it by time. The best way is to wait until it has doubled, no matter what the clock shows. But you insist on going by the clock, don't change the time, wait the 30 minutes. It may be underproofed (with such a short time given by the recipe, there is virtually no chance of overproofing it), but the same would have happened if you were using the original amounts and going by the clock. Dough proofing and timeThe rising time for dough at room temperature is not affected by recipe scaling, the time it takes a specific dough to double will be the same regardless of the size of your batch. If the temperature in your proofing container is significantly different from the dough temperature, you will see some effect on rising times with different batch sizes and dough shapes, as the center of the dough will need some time to get to the same temperature as the proofing container, and warmer dough rises quicker than cold dough. This is unlikely to have a measurable effect at dough amounts used by home bakers, especially considering that the possible proofing temperature window is rather narrow.  <sep>  Q: How does halving a bread recipe impact rising time?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: For the same reason that fast food burgers are often dry :) When beef hits high heat, the juices go in the opposite direction. This is why when pan-frying a steak, you know it's close to medium rare once you see the juices start to come through the top. The fat in burgers does the same thing, it moves away from the heat source, and back into the rest of the meat. That's just what happens when meat cooks and constricts. Many fast food joints use a double grill (you pull an inverted flat top down on top of the burger on the flat top). Whoops, there goes practically everything moist in the 3 or so minutes they cook them.Using steam, you make this a much gentler process. As the patty is cooking from the top and bottom and sides at once, but with a more gentle heat, the fat (and some juices) come out instead of going to hide on the other side of the patty that isn't on a heat source.  <sep>  Q: How does adding water to the pan help the burger become better ?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I've only heard of massaging kale. If you rub the greens together they get softer, darker and more tender and useable in a salad. Never done it with anything else. Wilted is steamed or blanched greens. Wilting definitely changes the texture and can make the greens more palatable and less bitter. I won't eat raw collards.

input: CONTEXT: A bunch of spinach usually weighs something like 250-500 grams. My best guess is that something like half that is the stems, which can easily be as long as the leaves. So very roughly, I'd say a bunch is 125-250 grams. Alternately, if you want to go by volume (e.g. if your store has bulk loose baby spinach), think of a bunch as something like a head of lettuce, except with the bottom third to half mostly stems.Full-size spinach also definitely gets a lot better than 4x6 cm leaves, so you may still be using somewhat more tender baby spinach,Â but that of course won't cause you any problems. (The stems on baby spinach are tender enough to eat, especially when blending, so you can use everything in your bags.)In any case, smoothies are really forgiving - not only do you not need a lot of precision, but you can just add and blend until the color and flavor look how you want!  <sep>  Q: How much is a bunch of spinach?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: To prevent the sticking, you might want to use a spray oil, maybe even just on the foil before you put the vegetables and potatoes on. It's a tiny amount of oil, not enough to make things noticeably greasy, but will be pretty effective. Another spray over the top will make them brown a little more nicely and may even prevent a little drying out. Alternatively, you can just toss them all in a bowl with a small amount of oil; it really doesn't take much, and I'd hardly describe it as ""covering with a lot of oil.""As for preventing things from drying out, first and foremost, don't overcook them. Broccoli and onions both roast very nicely, but you definitely want to pull it out before it starts browning/burning too much. If you slice the potatoes thinly enough, they'll cook in roughly the same amount of time as the broccoli and onions. So if things are getting overcooked, just don't leave them in the oven as long.You can also always try covering them. Another sheet of foil over the top will trap a fair amount of moisture, letting them steam a bit and probably preventing some burning as well.(I suppose it's also possible that it's all drying out because you're cooking them too slowly, so they have plenty of time for moisture to escape, but that seems less likely given the way you described things.)  <sep>  Q: Looking to bake side dishes, how do I stop problems with dryness A: As for preventing things from drying out, first and foremost, don't overcook them  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Is there any way to keep stuff from sticking to tin foil?

input: CONTEXT: My own sugar cookie recipe is quite dry as well. It cracks along the edges when pressed or rolled and is easily ""broken"".I've never experienced a problem with the dough being so dry it doesn't take to cookie cutters, but if your dough is literally falling apart you may want to just spritz (or in the absence of a kitchen water spray bottle, sprinkle with your finger tips) cold water on it. (Like adding water to pie dough) Give it one sprinkle/spritz and kneed it in. Repeat until it just stops breaking. Don't go overboard and make it gooey.I'd use water over oil or milk because it's the least likely to change the structure of your cookie in the baking process. Such minuscule amounts of water shouldn't yield a detectable change in the end product.If this is a consistent problem with the recipe, in the future I'd decrease the flour by a tablespoon or two and see if that helps.  <sep>  Q: How can I fix my dry crumbly cookie dough?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I'm not sure about the texture (looseness), especially since those are two different methods. My best guess would be that it's just a flour measurement thing - moisture content in flour can vary, so the best thing to do is look for hints in the recipe about the desired texture (like ""It should tear slightly as it falls from the beater""), and increase or decrease the flour to match.The primary flavors here are salt and chicken, so first just check the amount of salt in both dumplings and broth. For the chicken, you're getting all the flavor out of it by making broth. So make sure you used enough chicken (and not too much water), and that you cooked it long enough. Those recipes use a pressure cooker - if you don't have one, it takes way longer to cook, of course.  <sep>  Q: I'm looking for Chicken & Dumplings pointers

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I've struggled with this issue as well because I live in a moist climate and instant espresso powder cakes up on me between uses.Generally recipes which use instant espresso power are trying to add a kick of bitter and roasted flavors to deepen chocolate flavors and make them richer. You can try substituting instant coffee 1:1, but the flavor of the baked good will certainly suffer a loss of richness. Increasing the amount of instant coffee, however, would likely add more bitter or acidic flavors -- and caffeine -- to the cookie or cake than you want. Also, instant coffee takes longer to dissolve, so it needs to be added straight to a liquid.There's no real way to substitute liquid coffee in most recipes, such as chocolate cookie or brownie recipes, because the recipe has no water in it in the first place. In the rare recipes where there is water, you could substitute strong-brewed coffee for an equal quantity of water+espresso powder, and this would likely work fairly well.So, summing up: there's no really good substitute for instant espresso powder in recipes which call for it that I've found with some significant experimentation. Hopefully someone else has had better ideas than me.  <sep>  Q: Instant espresso powder substitutions? A: you could substitute strong-brewed coffee for an equal quantity of water+espresso powder  Q: I don't have the powder, thats what I'd like to substitute.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The term is not really defined that way. In the strict sense, it only has meaning for lean doughs - made of only flour, water, yeast and salt, eventually preferments or later mixins like seeds. You can extend it to enriched doughs (those that have fat, milk, eggs, tomato juice, etc.) but then it is no longer sharply defined. Calculating the exact content of water (e.g. adding to the calculation 17 g of water for every 100 g of butter) are pretty useless, because the water bound in an emulsion or other kind of colloid doesn't behave the same way as free water when making a dough. So, a dough with 100 g water and 100 g butter will be extremely different from a dough with 117 g of water, and still pretty different from one with 117 g of water and 83 g of oil. So, there is no real formula any more to create an actual percentage. The concept still stays somewhat useful in this case, but you have to ""play it by ear"". When you are trying to judge how soft a given enriched dough will be, you can start by calculating all the liquid and fat ingredients as if they were ""hydration"", which gives you a rough guide to compare it to other doughs, and then you have to make it and gain a tactile understanding of how it actually behaves.  <sep>  Q: What counts as ""hydration"" when figuring Dough Hydration?

The only thing to keep in mind is that duck feet, like any other duck parts, are substantially more fatty than their chicken equivalents, so assuming you want a clear or mostly-clear stock, you'll have to spend a lot of time skimming.Alternatively you can clean the feet and other bones by boiling them in plain water for 5-10 minutes, then dumping it all out and starting over - which is what your linked recipe suggests. I don't usually do this for brown stocks because you lose a lot of flavour, but if you're starting from raw then it won't make much difference and it's an easy/lazy way to get rid of a lot of the fat at once. <sep> Q: Can I use duck feet to make duck stock A: The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet  Q: Does it add the same flavor and mouth feel?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: There could be two factors involved. First, the freshness of the celery. Restaurants, especially those that serve large amounts, are going through a lot of product. This means that you are more likely to get really fresh celery.Next, storing in water is very likely an issue. I would suggest buying celery within a day or so of when you plan to use it. Wash and dry it thoroughly. Then trim and cut to your desired size. Then immediately place the celery in a plastic container or zipper bag and place in the refigerator until serving.Each time you take it out for serving, remove the amount you plan to use and return the rest to the refrigerator. The 'leftover' celery should remain fresh and crisp for several days.  <sep>  Q: Why does raw celery from a restaurant taste different than raw celery at home? A: First, the freshness of the celery. Restaurants, especially those that serve large amounts, are going through a lot of product. This means that you are more likely to get really fresh celery  Q: I store my celery in water, shouldn't that keep it fresh? A: Wash and dry it thoroughly. Then trim and cut to your desired size. Then immediately place the celery in a plastic container or zipper bag and place in the refigerator until serving  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: I always thought I did it the best way, are there any other possible reasons restaurant celery tastes better?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I would use any uncolored brandy made from distilled fruit. Himbeergeist, sliwowitz, or what you can lay your hands on. Kirsch doesn't taste much like cherries, and I suspect that it functions more as a solvent for some of the aroma in the spices than for adding its own taste. Even though it does contribute a bit, the taste will be subtle, and other slight fruity notes from a different fruit brandy will blend with the heavy spices just as well. In a pinch, you could use a colored brandy too, like Chantre. But it will add more of its own flavor, and while it can make a good combination, it will be further from the original than a random obstwasser. I would avoid any liqueurs, they will add way too much foreign taste, and also won't have enough alcohol to solve the spices in the same way.  <sep>  Q: Are there substitute for Kirsch in Leckerli (Basel Lackerli) cookies? A: In a pinch, you could use a colored brandy too, like Chantre  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Would that change the consistency of the cookie dough?

input: CONTEXT: rfusca already gave very good suggestions for the literal question from the title. However, you can also address your problem the other way round. First, cook the soup until your noodles are al dente (but will become just right while cooling at a normal speed). Take the big pot of soup off the heat. Second, take a small pot, and fill it with just one portion of soup per eater. Put it on the heat, and cook until the noodles are done. (Alternatively, put the single portions into porcelain bowls and microwave until the noodles are ready - it spares you washing an additional pot, but I wouldn't nuke a good soup for no reason). Third, eat your cooked soup portions and let the big pot of soup slowly cool on its own. Fourth, freeze the soup from the big pot. Finis. Note that from a food safety point of view, you are better off with flash cooling the soup. But what I outlined here is probably much simple and hassle-free. Plus, 2-3 liters of soup minus a portion or two should spend less than the magical 4 hours in the danger zone while cooling. If you are doing this with a very big pot of soup and feeding lots of people, you should probably prefer a rapid cooling.  <sep>  Q: How can I stop the cooking in my chicken and noodle soup?

input: CONTEXT: Flour is a thickening agent, plain and simple. However adding it without cooking it first can lead to your dish having a raw flour taste, and you can get blobs of flour in it, so I would ignore the recipes which say coat with flour without cooking it first, or use cornstarch (cornflour) instead. Alternatively you can make a roux with flour in a separate pan and add it in later. This is simply mixing equal weights of flour and butter and cooking it in a frying pan until it has the color you want. A lighter roux will add a paler color and a milder flavor, a darker roux adds a deeper color and richer flavor.  <sep>  Q: Have you ever made a ragout?

input: CONTEXT: Restaurants quite often cook pigs cheeks 'sous vide', but unless you have, or fancy investing in a water bath, you can do things the old fashioned way.How you prepare the cheeks for cooking will, to some extent, depend on which part you're cooking. If you're going to cook the whole cheek, you really should think about soaking in a brine of sugar, salt, vinegar and spices for 24 to 48 hours. If you're just cooking the 'pad' that part can be skipped.The thing to remember with cheeks, is they are quite a fatty meat and the muscle fibres are very dense, so whichever method you choose, it's going to take time.One classic method is braising the cheeks with a variety of vegetables and something slightly sweet and sharp as a counter for the fat and cook in the oven for 2 to 3 hours at around 180c (350f) Basically dust the cheeks in a little flour and season, then brown in some olive oil. remove form the pan and lightly sautÃ© your vegetables, use leeks, baby onions, carrots, apples, garlic etc. add the cheeks pack to the pan, add some stock or stock/cider mix and cook. You could also do this on the hob (cooker top) in a heavy bottomed pan, but cook for 4 hours on a low heat.  <sep>  Q: How should I cook pigs cheeks?

input: CONTEXT: The great benefit of brining is that it opens the fibers of the meat and allows the water, and what is dissolved in the water, into the meat. I suggest you convince yourself of this by adding a fragrant herb such as rosemary to a chicken breast brine, and comparing it side-by-side with an unbrined breast. The difference, deep into the meat, will be noticeable. It is not large chunks of the herbs that find their way into the meat, but the oils and dissolved parts.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: In most wheat-based recipes, gluten strands are formed while you work the dough. If you don't rest the dough, rolling can be more difficult and you may get a tougher texture in the final product.Additionally, refrigerating the dough up to a certain point will firm up the fats in the recipe (butter, etc), which will make the dough less mushy and will making rolling out the dough evenly a bit easier. Unless the dough is so firm it becomes brittle, refrigeration will make the dough less fragile in most cases.Perhaps less important, the moisture levels may become a bit more consistent throughout the dough as well.  <sep>  Q: Why should I rest gingerbread dough?

input: CONTEXT: @Rumtscho has some good points, especially around using non-non-stick pans. A cast iron frying pan would work better for that. However, if you don't have one my suggestion for pan-frying something like breaded fish would be to pull the fish through the oil puddle with your fingers or tongs as you put it in and then let the fish sit on the non-oily part of the pan. Repeat that for all the pieces. I think what you'll find doing that though is that the breading will soak up all the oil, and you'll need to add some more in anyway in order to have enough to coat the other side when you turn the fish over. Adding more oil will cool the pan and you won't get as good as a result, so it's counter-productive. You're better off adding more oil at the beginning. If you are worried about health, don't fry in oil!  <sep>  Q: What is the best oil for evenly distributing oils (butter, chicken or bacon fat, and other oils) around a non-stick pan###or best way sorry.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: It sounds very much like you didn't manage to completely dissolve the sugar. It's also possible to get a bad texture from ice crystals in your ice cream, but I don't think you'd describe it as gritty or sandy, just icy.It can be rather difficult to dissolve that much sugar in liquid, especially if it's cold straight from the fridge. You might want to try heating it gently and stirring, and being careful to go until there's no undissolved sugar hiding at the bottom. That does make the chilling take a bit longer, probably more like 4-8 hours or overnight, not just 1-2 hours. But in my experience heating to dissolve is pretty much standard in ice cream recipes, presumably because it's about the only way to do it easily.  <sep>  Q: My homemade ice cream texture is gritty/sandy, any advice?

input: CONTEXT: The brown stringy fibers form in the avocado flesh after it is bruised or the avocado is past ripe.The way to avoid this is to plan ahead. Buy your avocados when they are green and very hard. Try to select ones that have not been abused (at least if you see one being knocked around, take a different one). When you get the avocados home, set them aside in a safe place for a couple/few days, & don't drop or manhandle them in the meantime. When they are ripe (yield slightly to gentle pressure, as they say) you have a couple days to use them. Putting them in the refrigerator can prolong their niceness a little bit if you are not quite ready to use them. Unless some mishap befell them before purchase, they should be beautiful and without those horrible stringy lesions.  <sep>  Q: How do I choose to avoid brown stringy fibres in avocado?###What is the best way to remove the brown stringy fibres in avocado?

There is a perception amongst the dutch that Americans eat nothing but meat and fat in huge portions. I did a semester abroad in the Netherlands.

So, after a couple days I asked them if this is what they had for breakfast every day. My host mother said, ""No, this is what we were told Americans have for breakfast everyday!""After a chat, they said they were buying British breakfast sausages and eggs for me. Their typical breakfast was a slice of bread, some cheese, and a very strongly flavored liverwurst. My tastes were not as developed back then. After two days of that I asked if there was any other breakfast choices. My host mother bought me suikerbrood. It is a loaf of bread with sugar baked in it. It was delicious! I told them that I enjoyed this new breakfast very much. This caused a lot of chortling for my two host siblings.

input: CONTEXT: One of the first things I learned in Indian cooking is that the combination of tomatoes, onions and ginger is self-thickening. As time went by, I realised that the thickening effect is far more noticable with old varieties of tomatoes - ""beef"" tomatoes and a lot of the modern varieties are difficult to thicken unless partially fried first.Despite the absence of ginger, I suspect that the thickening is purely a natural action between the tomatoes and the onion, and that the tomatoes used were some particularly nice old variety.  <sep>  Q: Why did my tomato soup turn thick and brownish?

input: CONTEXT: Basically, a good stock is fairly concentrated. In general, home cooks use too high a water to bones/veg ratio for a proper result. So, when you leave your stock uncovered you are concentrating everything and, perhaps, getting a good result...at least one you like. However, this is difficult to tell without knowing your recipe. With respect to adding water back later, it is not an uncommon practice to reduce a well-made stock further, by half or more, simply for storage purposes. Then when ready to use, water is added to bring it back to the original strength.  <sep>  Q: Should I reduce my stock and then add water?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Foor food safety, the recommendation means that the coolest part of the meat should reach the target temperature. For something like a beef or pork roast, the coolest point will be generally in the very center of the roast. For chicken or turkey, it will often be where the leg joins the body. You may need to probe more than one more place to find the coolest reading.Now, because the meat surrounding that coolest point is at a higher temperature, the meat will continue to cook after it is removed from the oven. How much of an increase will depend on how big the roast is. In other words, a large roast will have a greater thermal mass â more meat towards the outside will be at a higher temperature, and the heat will transfer into the coolest point, raising its ultimate temperature.So, the practical answer to your question is that you need to anticipate when the target temperature will be attained. To err on the side of food safety, keep the meat in the oven until it reaches or is very close to the target temperature. With a little experience, you'll be able to gauge how much of a temperature increase occurs with various roasts, and remove it from the oven earlier.The bottom line however, is that the roast needs to ultimately reach the target temperature.  <sep>  Q: In what stage should the temperature of meat be taken? A: Foor food safety, the recommendation means that the coolest part of the meat should reach the target temperature  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: What is the target temperature?

input: CONTEXT: There's no particular reason you couldn't prepare a stock with something other than water, but it's the equivalent of buying a ream of heavy pink paper, rather than plain white photocopy paper. If that's the effect you really want, great. The thing is, stock is meant to be as boring as plain white photocopy paper -- it is a foundation for other things, versatile and effective, subtly enhancing without overwhelming the dish. For your beer idea, for example, I would cook down a couple bottles and add some stock to it. That way, the rest of my batch of stock would be useful for other recipes that don't use beer.Note that stock may be boring but shouldn't be flavorless; stock still should taste good. If your stock was flavorless, try upping the amount of meat, veggies, and herbs compared to bones. Also, bear in mind that stock should not contain salt (you will likely reduce the stock at some point). The lack of salt, however, will deaden the flavor. When you are ready to use the stock, be sure to add a pinch of salt.  <sep>  Q: Can I use other liquid than water when making stock?

input: CONTEXT: When metal is exposed to microwave radiation, an electric potential difference can develop as the microwaves generate electric charge in parts of the metal. Flowing electricity can cause sparks as electrons migrate to places of lower potential. Solid metal is susceptible to this because its electrons are relatively loose, making it a good conductor of electricity.Calcium (Ca) in milk is bonded with other atoms (mostly as calcium phosphate), so it doesn't behave as a solid metal would: first because its electrons are secured in bonds with other atoms, and second, because the Ca atoms are not aggregated together but intermixed with nonconducting ones.  <sep>  Q: How come heating milk in the microwave is safe?

input: CONTEXT: I'm afraid you interpret the tables wrong. You aren't destroying calories, you are adding water (=0 cal) to the dry rice. As the rice absorbs the water, you are in fact measuring rice + water for cooked rice.This is true for calorie tables that measure by volume (like here) and by weight.If you are cooking your rice by boiling and straining, you are effectively losing a few calories due to the starch that gets drained with the water, but that's not what you asked here.  <sep>  Q: How to maintain the calories in rice (which were present in it in its raw form) after cooking it?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Garlic flavors are soluble in oil, simply chopping up garlic and putting it in with the rice will not distribute the flavor well. I would recommend you chop the garlic finely and then infuse into a tablespoon of oil or butter by putting the pan on very low heat for a few minutes. Then add the rice and stir to coat the grains with the infused oil before adding water and cooking as normal. How much garlic to use depends on how strong your garlic is and how garlic-y you want it to taste. 5 tbsp of rice isn't much, for a medium garlic flavor using average strength garlic a whole small clove or half a large is probably enough. With the garlic I grow I'd add a few slices from a clove at most. Another option would be to cook the rice and then stir in the garlic infused oil afterwards, The benefits to this option are that you can drain the rice after cooking without all the flavor going down the drain.  <sep>  Q: What is the best way to infuse garlic flavor in the bland brown rice?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Puddings, of the type in your recipe, are thickened mostly by starch gelling. The egg yolks and milk provide some thickening as well as the smooth, custardy texture.Both the starch and egg proteins gel before the boiling temperature. Recipes call for a few minutes of boiling for an entirely different and fascinating reason.There is an enzyme in raw egg yolks that digests starches. A few minutes of boiling is required to deactivate those enzymes. If your pudding didn't gel, and some time has passed, your eggs may have eaten your cornstarch. In this case, boiling it more wouldn't help.You might try whisking in some more starch and then boiling it again. This would take some experimentation.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Your ribs will have a lot less flavor if you do not use a dry rub. However you can minimize some of the time (and only a bit of the flavor) by putting on the rub, wrapping in foil, and immediately putting them in the oven or on the grill. The process of putting your rub together probably takes only about 5 minutes - it's the fridge time that takes a while.Sitting in the fridge allows some of the flavors to permeate, and if you used a more permeable material could allow your ribs to air out a bit. These are good things, but for my rib recipe I don't put the ribs in the fridge and they still taste great. I also don't put the barbecue sauce on until about the last 20 minutes of oven time, when the foil comes off and the sauce goes on. Until then the ribs stay in the foil.I looked up North Carolina (which uses a sauce that isn't tomato based in the eastern part of the state), South Carolina (a mustard sauce), Texas, Memphis (which uses no sauce), Kansas City (tomato based-sauce that is rather sweet) - all of them used a dry rub even with wide variations on the sauce and for both beef and pork ribs.  <sep>  Q: Is dry rub necessary in making bbq ribs?###is there an alternate method rather than the dry rub A: Your ribs will have a lot less flavor if you do not use a dry rub  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: will the ribs taste the same if i just lather them with some bbq sauce and then cook them

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: To prevent the sticking, you might want to use a spray oil, maybe even just on the foil before you put the vegetables and potatoes on. It's a tiny amount of oil, not enough to make things noticeably greasy, but will be pretty effective. Another spray over the top will make them brown a little more nicely and may even prevent a little drying out. Alternatively, you can just toss them all in a bowl with a small amount of oil; it really doesn't take much, and I'd hardly describe it as ""covering with a lot of oil.""As for preventing things from drying out, first and foremost, don't overcook them. Broccoli and onions both roast very nicely, but you definitely want to pull it out before it starts browning/burning too much. If you slice the potatoes thinly enough, they'll cook in roughly the same amount of time as the broccoli and onions. So if things are getting overcooked, just don't leave them in the oven as long.You can also always try covering them. Another sheet of foil over the top will trap a fair amount of moisture, letting them steam a bit and probably preventing some burning as well.(I suppose it's also possible that it's all drying out because you're cooking them too slowly, so they have plenty of time for moisture to escape, but that seems less likely given the way you described things.)  <sep>  Q: Looking to bake side dishes, how do I stop problems with dryness A: As for preventing things from drying out, first and foremost, don't overcook them  Q: Is there any way to keep stuff from sticking to tin foil?

input: CONTEXT: Grana padano and pecorino romano are two other very savory, hard grating cheeses that work well on pasta. They taste a bit different than Parmigiano-Reggiano, but are quite good in their own right and often less expensive. You can also look at parmesan type cheeses that are not actually Parmigiano-Reggiano. For example, Whole Foods often has one from Argentina that offers a reasonable price/performance tradeoff. All of that said, in many people's opinion, nothing is really quite as delicious as true Parmigiano-Reggiano.  <sep>  Q: Is there a Cheaper alternative to parmesan cheese?

It congeals in the fridge much like any other fat will (think butter or bacon grease). Apparently, extra virgin olive oil may suffer from condensation in the bottle affecting the flavor. It may also turn cloudy. But in general, you should be fine. Even if it does go bad, it should just affect the flavor and not be harmful, just gross. So if it tastes bad, toss it.

So shake them and listen, and also judge the weight, holding them in one hand.Once you buy a coconut, place it between a rock or three. Make one slice with a large heavy knife to remove the top and the top hull inside the outer hull. Pour out the milk and chill if you wish. Then cut the coconut in half. Scoop out the meat. It should be firm but soft. Place that on a plate or eat with your hands.When harvesting, after dropping a bunch of coconuts, you select the ones whose outer hull is 1/3 to 1/4 brown. Those you sell locally. The green ones you take to the road to sell to the waiting trucks. Those are for shipment. All extra coconuts should be saved for making coconut rum. The outer and inner hulls are saved for cooking and coconut charcoal. Any that drop from the tree and split open go into the rum also, or can be used as pig fodder.  <sep>  Q: My last coconut tasted like soap--how do I avoid this?

input: CONTEXT: The great benefit of brining is that it opens the fibers of the meat and allows the water, and what is dissolved in the water, into the meat. I suggest you convince yourself of this by adding a fragrant herb such as rosemary to a chicken breast brine, and comparing it side-by-side with an unbrined breast. The difference, deep into the meat, will be noticeable. It is not large chunks of the herbs that find their way into the meat, but the oils and dissolved parts.

input: CONTEXT: For bacterial spoilage, keeping the soup hot would be more effective. As for ""preserving"" the soup, refrigeration will be drastically more effective. The high temperatures of simmering would keep the bacterial level pretty much nil, but the constant heat will ruin your soup on it's own. Anything in the soup will become mush, flavors will become over-concentrated, and some flavors can drastically change from prolonged exposure to such heat.Prompt chilling and cold storage after cooking will greatly slow down the rate at which bacteria can repopulate the soup, and will also keep everything else in the soup about the way it was when the soup was at it's prime. To really keep textures nice, I'd recommend pulling off the soup that will be stored while vegetables & meat are still a little firmer than you'd like so that they'll finish when you reheat.  <sep>  Q: Is continuously simmering or refrigerating cooked soup a more effective way to prevent spoilage?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The most common reason for leakage with Cordon Bleu Chicken is that the packets are too thick, which makes it impossible to get a perfect fold; you need to pound the breasts very thin - less than 1/2"", maybe a little more than 1/4"".The other ""trick"" is to make a small cut along the folded edge of the breast after you fold and seal the packets, which essentially makes it almost like a sandwich; the top and bottom parts can move independently and you don't have tension trying to pull the top piece away.Just don't cut so deep that you cause an immediate leak; if you've pounded the breast to 1/3"" thickness, then your cut should be no more than about 1/8"".If you do it this way, you shouldn't even need to use toothpicks; I never do, and I haven't sprung a single leak in my last 20 or so preparations.  <sep>  Q: How can I keep the cheese from leaking out of my cordon bleu during cooking?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: For a few months I would really not worry too much about your storage, half a year at 80F is not going to destroy your wine. If you have the space in your fridge then that is a better option, but I doubt even the most dedicated wine snob would be able to tell much of a difference. Humidity only matters if you have wine with traditional corks as low humidity will dry them out and spoil the wine, if you are buying twist caps and synthetic corks then humidity is not a consideration. A few months in low humidity should not result in cork drying, but year will. Vibration used to be a problem with older fridges, most newer fridges are pretty quiet and low vibration so I wouldn't worry there, especially for shorter term storage. Colder temperatures for storage will not cause a noticeable effect on wine's flavor over a few months, you'll want to let it warm up some for the best flavor though. Storing an opened bottle of wine in the fridge is a good idea in fact, as it will keep it drinkable longer. So unless you are buying expensive wine to keep for a long time you should be fine no matter which option you choose.  <sep>  Q: How important are each of temperature, humidity, and vibration for storing wine?###I'm deciding whether to buy a wine chiller for my apartment, maybe this one. I could only realistically keep it on top of my refrigerator. The alternative would be to keep wine in my fridge (the temperature in my apartment often gets into the 80s which I understand to be unacceptable).

input: CONTEXT: The primary reason is definitely convenience. If you don't want skin and seeds in your sauce, then you have to do some work to avoid it. Yes, it's possible, e.g. passing through a food mill, or blanching and peeling plus retaining only the flesh, but having it already done is a whole lot easier.Passata is usually much thicker too, so it won't need as long a cooking time to reduce into a non-watery sauce as fresh tomatoes. On top of that, you don't have to worry about whether you can find good fresh tomatoes, e.g. if it's winter and they're out of season.Your two cases for comparison seem to overlook this: if you just chop and cook, you'll have skin and seeds in your sauce, as well as excess liquid to cook down, while if you use passata, you won't. (Also, for what it's worth, you'd need pretty giant tomatoes to get the equivalent of 3/4 cup of passata out of one tomato.)Of course, if you don't mind skin and seeds, it's also perfectly fine to simply cook fresh tomatoes and be done with it.Note that you can often get similar advantages from other canned tomato products. In the US, crushed tomatoes are far more common, and a roughly similar texture. (Peeled whole tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste can also be useful depending on what texture you're aiming for.)  <sep>  Q: Why specifically use Passata, rather than tomatoes, in Ragu?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: An oven is the way to go.Toasting on a frying pan is a pain because you have to stand there shaking it for so long and it is far to easy to scorch if you pause.I have seen some recipes call for low oven temps but I use 350F (175C) for 10 to 15 minutes stirring a few times. Some sources online recommend as low as 5 minutes but I personally have not ever had them done that quickly. They still have to be checked or they will burn.I like to use my toaster oven because it heats up faster and is cheaper to run.I have used an air popcorn popper with good results. Don't overfill it and remove them when they smell nutty. It goes very fast but you have to do them in batches if you have many.For a pie or other sweet applications, I like to toss the nuts in butter and brown sugar and let them candy in the oven. The fat makes it harder to burn them. Obviously this won't fit for all recipes.I personally have not had good results using the microwave.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Lime juice isn't going to make it less spicy, if anything I've found it accentuates the spiciness a bit although I'm not sure of the mechanism. It could be that the acidity frees up more capsaicin compounds (what makes hot food hot), or wakes up your taste buds more. Most likely you have simply added a weak jalapeno. Peppers of the same variety can vary in heat strength quite a bit depending on the where and how it was grown, although you'll get weak and strong peppers from the same plant.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Short answer: no, there's no standard scale.First of all, I'm pretty sure it's common enough for stoves of varying power to use the same range of numbers. I see an awful lot of stoves that go up to 10 in the US, and I'm quite confident they're not all the same.Second, the real property of a stove is its power output, not its temperature. You can clearly see this if you go look at gas stoves - they're described in units of power (BTUs in the US, hooray). The temperature resulting from a given power will depend greatly on what you're cooking. A burner with nothing on it will have a much higher temperature than one with a heavy pot of boiling water on it. To a lesser degree, the temperature will also depend on the environment - a cooler room with some air circulation will keep the burner a bit cooler than a warm room with still air.So, if you really want to know what you're getting, you have to look up the power output of the stove - or failing that, maybe try to measure it yourself.  <sep>  Q: How hot are electric home stoves? A: the real property of a stove is its power output, not its temperature  Q: How do you set the temperature of the electric home stove?

input: CONTEXT: Pepper sauces usually deliver an aroma (from the peppers), some sweet/sour/salty element (from the pickling ingredients mostly), and heat (from the peppers). A hotter pepper will not necessarily be stronger in aroma, so using this kind of super hot pepper alone can end you up with a sauce that is hot but poor in flavor. Also, given that capsaicin is very soluble in fat but not very soluble in water/vinegar, such a sauce will have a very uneven distribution of heat and will likely end up with a very harsh, unpleasant heat no matter how diluted - similar to throwing chile powder into a lean soup.  <sep>  Q: How much pepper sauce could you get out of a Carolina Reaper?###If you can get one pepper and let's say for arguments sake assume that this pepper is 1 500 000 SHU. ###How much sauce could you actually make from one such pepper?

input: CONTEXT: Oversalting is best dealt with by serious dilution. I'd make a large, not very meaty dish from it, with lots of vegetables, cooked for a while. Fry onions and other veg, add liquid, and stir in the cooked beef. But soaking the meat should help as well. Either soak in plain water and discard the water, or soak in something you might add to the sauce (wine, beer, diluted citrus juice... ). I'd also cut it small before soaking/cooking. Most of the salt will be on the surface but you want to expose add much as possible of the meat to the liquid. Soaking should be done in the fridge, for a few hours.You could go for a tomato-based sauce, a curry using coconut milk, or a sticky orange and chilli sauce, so long as the ratio of beef to everything else (and beef to initial liquid) is small. The initial liquid shouldn't bring any more salt with it, which rules out most cmmercial stock preparations, and possbile home-made stock. These are just ideas, many beef in sauce dishes would adapt.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Yes. Water boils at about 212F (100C) and meat is cooked from 140F to 160F. If you left the meat in there for a very long time it would eventually approach 212F and start to get tough.The time that they give you is going to be the time it takes to ensure that the meat is safe to eat.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Yes, it can go bad.It's pretty much the same as the way flour can go bad: the fats can go rancid. Grains are mostly starch, but they contain enough fat for rancidity to be a noticeable problem. There's a huge amount of variability in how long that takes, though. If it's airtight and kept in a cool, dark place, it'll last much longer than the best before date. But if it's been exposed to air, light, or heat, it can go pretty fast, perhaps even before the best before date.So, smell it. If you detect any unpleasant smells, you probably don't want to eat it. Even if you don't smell anything obvious, it could still be subtly rancid, so if you're planning on serving it to anyone, you might want to cook a small bit to test.  <sep>  Q: Does polenta go off'?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: So, just answering the new part of the question:You can simply season ""over the top"" of the existing seasoning. To do this, you'd go through the normal seasoning process, wiping the pan with oil, heating in a 500F oven, wiping again, heating again. This will fill in the ""holes"" in your seasoning and you'll be able to use the pan again.However, you will also end up with somewhat rough, uneven seasoning on the bottom. This will make things more likely to stick than if you completely reseasoned the pan. You can improve this by scrubbing the bottom of the pan with a mixture of course salt and oil. This will ""sand down"" the seasoning without completely removing it.You should also ask yourself if maybe the original seasoning of the pan wasn't faulty, given that some of it already scrubbed off.  <sep>  Q: Is there a way to re-season a cast iron pan if I scrubbed it all off?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: As you probably know, volkornbrot and similar breads are designed to bake at a lower temperature for a longer time. 240 C sounds way too high to me. 150-180 C should be about right, and leave the bread in for a long time (up to 3 hours), until the loaf starts to pull away from the sides of the pan. Even after this baking process, because the bread batter is much wetter than a standard bread, you should not slice or eat the bread until it has had time to cool and ""rest,"" about 24 hours. If you slice it right away, the heat and moisture escape and the inside is still doughy/raw. If you wait, the moisture will have time to distribute throughout the loaf and the inside will firm up. Just be patient! The benefit is that the loaf should last for a very long time wrapped in plastic, especially if you put the unused portion in the fridge.  <sep>  Q: Is it possible to make black bread in a microwave?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I don't think this has a single answer: The amount of alcohol would depend on the alcohol content of the soaking liquor or liqueur, soaking time, temperature of chocolate, and how thick the strawberry was. I suspect uncut strawberries would take at least several days to fully absorb alcohol and reach equilibrium, but the surface should take up alcohol fairly quickly. If they are cut up, exposing the more porous interior, I imagine an overnight soak would be sufficient to reach maximum alcohol content. The enormous, bloated mutant strawberries you sometimes see at stores could take considerably longer than others to absorb their maximum alcohol. Alcohol is much more volatile than water, so the immersion in warm, melted chocolate would remove some alcohol, but once the chocolate cools, it should trap any remaining content.The flavor of alcohol is easily masked by other flavors at under 20% content; this could explain why your friend didn't taste it, but you did. It's quite possible the strawberries packed a sobriety-busting punch, but it was disguised by the chocolate and fruit tastes.  <sep>  Q: How much alcohol remains in strawberries soaked in alcohol? A: The amount of alcohol would depend on the alcohol content of the soaking liquor or liqueur, soaking time, temperature of chocolate, and how thick the strawberry was  Q: Is the flavor a good indicator of how much alcohol is left?

input: CONTEXT: A lot of sourdough recipes don't call for a sponge, per se, because the starter essentially already is a sponge. The purpose of a sponge in a bread with normal yeast is to allow a longer fermentation time and extra time for enzymatic reactions to happen in the flour before adding it to the final batch. This isn't necessary with sourdough the starter is continuously fermenting and reacting. And your guess is about right, if the proportion of starter you add is too high, the waste products and dead yeast cells in it can cause changes in the gluten that make it very slack and unusable.  <sep>  Q: How does a sourdough sponge work? A: The purpose of a sponge in a bread with normal yeast is to allow a longer fermentation time and extra time for enzymatic reactions to happen  Q: wouldn't the sourdough break down the gluten in the sponge, thereby greatly reducing the amount in the final product that you have to work with?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: As with all fish, just don't cook it any longer than necessary - all you need is long enough to get the temperature up (to 145F/63C), and anything past that is just overcooking. Boiling is a really fast cooking method, and simmering or poaching is not much slower. Note that this also means removing it from the water as soon as it's done, since the water is way above the necessary temperature and will easily overcook seafood even if it's removed from the stove.Tiny fish like you mention will probably be done in only a minute or two, similar to small. The best way to tell, though, is not to use a timer but to directly check the fish: it should be opaque and flaky. (For small fish, those aren't very big flakes, but you could still pull it apart or bend it and tell.)  <sep>  Q: How to cook small fish(unfrozen and frozen) in water without overcooking? A: all you need is long enough to get the temperature up (to 145F/63C  Q: What if the anchovies, sardines or whitebait are cooked from frozen(due to perishability), how long should they be simmered for in this case?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: It is true, in my experience. However, if your recipe does not require salt, you should not be adding it, of course. Removing moisture from onion with the aid of salt helps it reach its desired state (brown or translucent, as desired) faster.I am most familiar with the use of onion in Indian cooking. I generally add a pinch or two of salt to onion when I start sauteing it. Onion starts sweating as soon as you add salt and start stirring. The reason that salt draws out moisture from onion is osmotic pressure. The surface of the onion acts as a semipermeable membrane barrier. Since the solution outside the onion is more concentrated with respect to salt, water moves out of the onion to the general liquid side, to balance the osmotic pressure on either side of the onion surface.  <sep>  Q: Is there any advantage to adding salt to onion while frying? A: Removing moisture from onion with the aid of salt helps it reach its desired state (brown or translucent, as desired) faster  Q: Why is removing moisture from onion important, for texture? A: helps it reach its desired state (brown or translucent, as desired) faster  Q: So, timing - Is there any advantage to adding salt to onion while frying itself rather than adding it the last? A: Onion starts sweating as soon as you add salt and start stirring  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: How much salt to add for a medium sized onion?

input: CONTEXT: Cincinnati Chili often has cardamom, along with cinnamon and cocoa. Cardamom is used in savory and sweet foods all over the world, not just in India. If you have reason to want to try this particular recipe, then try the recipe as written. There are thousands of beloved recipes for all kinds of chili. There is no reason to say, ""That one looks good, I'll do it just like that but omit a certain ingredient 'cause it makes me nervous."" Your friend's advice is a bit odd to me because Garam Masala usually contains cardamom (sometimes black, green and brown)My advice is to either try the recipe as written, or find another with which you're more comfortable.Or come up with your own. There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to chili.BTW, I love cardamom in savory. I make a Vietnamese Beef Noodle Soup (Pho) that I crave if I haven't had it for a while. It wouldn't be right without cardamom.  <sep>  Q: Is it a good idea to use cardamom in chili?###I am preparing a chili for a contest. The recipe calls for cardamom (along with chili powder and cumin). I have never cooked with it before.### From my research, it seems this spice is used more commonly with Indian cuisine. I do love Indian food. In fact, a good Indian friend at work tells me he does use cardamom, but most usually for sweets. A: Cincinnati Chili often has cardamom, along with cinnamon and cocoa. Cardamom is used in savory and sweet foods all over the world, not just in India  Q: But I wonder if the combination of cardamom and chili powder (and possibly cloves) will make my beef chili work.### Has anyone used this spice for anything other than sweets? A: I love cardamom in savory. I make a Vietnamese Beef Noodle Soup (Pho) that I crave if I haven't had it for a while. It wouldn't be right without cardamom  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: oh. thats good to know.###Does anyone have strong feelings about using it or omitting it in a beef chili?

input: CONTEXT: Some crabs are better tasting than others. Ornamental crabs, to my knowledge none are inedible, but tend to be very small, and high skin/seed to flesh so tend to be too much trouble to bother with. Larger crabs though can be very desirable for some applications. They are often blended in mixed ciders, both sweet and fermented. They will be tart to very tart and even bitter, but when blended with other juices add what many people consider a very refreshing bite to the juice. Candied crabs and apple butter are commonly made with them and they can be used for jams other applications especially mixed with other apples to increase tartness.There are a wide variations of varieties, just as with full size apples, and some will seem better than other. If they are wild seedling trees rather than grafter varieties, the quality of the fruit may be hit and miss, and even some of the cultivated named varieties may be astringent, especially some which are marketed for their hard cider characteristics where the astringency is desirable. If the particular ones you have will work will be mostly dependent on your tastes and the variety, and how willing you are to work with the smaller fruit. Even the sweetest crabs are likely to have a lot more tartness than a granny smith.  <sep>  Q: Are crabapples edible? A: Some crabs are better tasting than others.

input: CONTEXT: I would not keep it or eat it and just consider it a loss. That is a long time for the food to cool down/seal, etc. The processing time is usually carefully calculated so that the core of the product in the jar gets to the proper temp. With the processing time only being 10 mins it would mean only the jar and maybe a small amount on the edges would have gotten to 240 deg F. I suppose it could make a difference if it was a hot pack vs. cold pack, but I would still not risk it.Since you're an experienced canner, I assume you already know that it's possible to lose pressure during the process and then restart the time when the canner gets back up to pressure, but that is usually a few minutes at most, not hours.  <sep>  Q: If there was an interruption in canning process, would the meat still be safe?

input: CONTEXT: Yes, you can definitely use UHT milk in bread. UHT is not usable for some applications, because its proteins have been changed by the heat. But in bread, you don't need the proteins from the milk. Bread recipes include milk to make the dough richer, so it is mostly the fat content that matters. Using UHT won't change anything in the dough structure. I even think that the usual unpleasant taste won't be noticeable, but I am not so sure about that. Still, it gets diluted a lot in dough, so if you can drink UHT as-is, you shouldn't have a problem with the bread taste.  <sep>  Q: Can I bake bread with long-life milk?

input: CONTEXT: Pepper sauces usually deliver an aroma (from the peppers), some sweet/sour/salty element (from the pickling ingredients mostly), and heat (from the peppers). A hotter pepper will not necessarily be stronger in aroma, so using this kind of super hot pepper alone can end you up with a sauce that is hot but poor in flavor.

input: CONTEXT: Oversalting is best dealt with by serious dilution. I'd make a large, not very meaty dish from it, with lots of vegetables, cooked for a while. Fry onions and other veg, add liquid, and stir in the cooked beef. But soaking the meat should help as well. Either soak in plain water and discard the water, or soak in something you might add to the sauce (wine, beer, diluted citrus juice... ). I'd also cut it small before soaking/cooking. Most of the salt will be on the surface but you want to expose add much as possible of the meat to the liquid. Soaking should be done in the fridge, for a few hours.You could go for a tomato-based sauce, a curry using coconut milk, or a sticky orange and chilli sauce, so long as the ratio of beef to everything else (and beef to initial liquid) is small.

input: CONTEXT: Traditionally, mozzarella is sold extremely fresh - as in made that day or the day before. If it's held for more than a day or so, it comes packaged in a brine. Most of the American stuff is just too soft to be held for packaging like other shredded cheese in the mega-mart.In the US, being extreme gluttons for convenience, we tend to make do with part-skim shredded mozzarella instead of the good stuff. Slight temperature variations can make the shreds stick together in a globby mass. It's harmless from a safety point of view, and the expiry date can be long after the occurrence of perfectly safe globbiness.Pro-Tip: Put the globby pieces in the freezer for 20 minutes, and then shred it like a block of harder cheese. Upon heating, it will melt (almost) as if the the globbiness had never happened. I have taken advantage of a few good sales that way.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: In the fridge, an hour should not be a problem, but could still end up bitter depending on the kind of onion used. Usually, Marinades, Pestos etc. that use mashed onions and/or garlic taste best if they are made the way the name ""Pesto"" suggests: Cutting stuff very fine, then using a mortar and pestle. Most explanations WHY that is the case have to with the fact that blenders tend to disintegrate cell walls with relatively rough cuts of a fast but half-sharp or blunt blade, releasing more enzymes etc. from the cell walls as opposed to from the cell contents. These are plausible, since some of the compounds in different parts of onion cells are known to actively react when the onion is disintegrated.Also, try adding oil (which you often want in a marinade anyway. No unrefined olive oil in a blender, though - that is known to get bitter!) while mortaring or blending - this will help extract flavor compounds and probably provide some oxidation protection.There is a well known marinade working with onions, garlic etc: Bulgogi marinade.  <sep>  Q: How long can blended onions stay relatively fresh?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The great benefit of brining is that it opens the fibers of the meat and allows the water, and what is dissolved in the water, into the meat. I suggest you convince yourself of this by adding a fragrant herb such as rosemary to a chicken breast brine, and comparing it side-by-side with an unbrined breast. The difference, deep into the meat, will be noticeable. It is not large chunks of the herbs that find their way into the meat, but the oils and dissolved parts. That is why you heat and steep the water before cooling it for brining.  <sep>  Q: What brine ingredients are effective?

It looks to be the built up bits of grease and other residues from the bottom of your cooking pans that have accumulated over the 5 years. Not saying you slopped lots but the smallest amounts of spatter from cooking will add up. I moved 6 months ago into a place with a new stove and I've done my best not to spill food and to always wipe up right away but I've noticed the burners getting marked. It doesn't wash off either. Do you find the elements you cook on the most are more marked?But to answer your original question whether the scratches affect the burners' performance, the answer is no.

input: CONTEXT: Assuming you didn't do some kind of ""flavor injection"" treatment, there is absolutely no reason why one part of a bird would taste radically different from another. I'm going to go with ""Bad Duck.""Cooking the bird slowly seriously reduces the possibility of a ""hot spot"" causing some kind of local taste variance. Breast meat will become overdone at the point where dark meat is still tasty, but that wouldn't explain smell or taste, and unpleasant smells are almost always related to bacterial issues.If it was discolored, it could have been local bruising, which would cause some taste issues, but, again, wouldn't explain the smell.  <sep>  Q: What happened to my duck?

input: CONTEXT: Some of your 'shortcuts' are not good ideas. Definitely start with cold water. Definitely bring up the temp slowly. Definitely do not boil. Do add aromatics upfront to the broth, but remove them as they get mushy so they don't cloud it.Standard ratio for beef broth would be: 8 pounds of bones to 6 quarts of water to 1 pound of veggies (onion, leek, carrot) to one 'boquet garni', essentially garlic, rosemary, anise flavoring for pho, and bay leaf, plus whatever else I forgot.If you have 'pond water', which I interpret as thin-tasting, you probably put too much water in the second time -- this is fixable by slowly evaporating out the water until it gets to a good texture. If you skimmed properly, it will be clear as you do this. I will typically strain through a kitchen towel or cheesecloth as the liquid evaporates down.I'm guessing you put in like a gallon of water, so you had like three or four times too much water.As a warning which you probably already know, you are not going to be able to duplicate your local pho joint's broth -- the broth recipe is the thing for pho makers, and they probably have a bunch of tricks they use, including using a neverending supply of yesterdays pho, that you won't be able to do at home. That said, you should be able to get a good beef broth if you follow some basic rules for making stock.  <sep>  Q: My beef broth is not coming out right, how do I properly make beef pho broth?

input: CONTEXT: I'm not sure I've ever seen chipotle paste called for in recipes; I searched around a bit and what I found was consistent with my experience. I saw chipotle en adobo, ground chipotle, and even whole dried chipotle. I also easily found recipes for chipotle en adobo. I don't think you'll have any trouble figuring out what to do with them.The most common way I've seen chipotles, both in grocery stores and in recipes, is chipotle en adobo. You can make your own by simmering dried chipotles in tomato paste with vinegar, garlic, onion (search for recipes if that's not specific enough). I suspect that most chipotle pastes you might find are something like this, but pureed, and possibly cooked until thicker.The other common way to use chipotles is as a powder; that's as easy as grinding them in a spice grinder. If you're using them in something that gets cooked for a decent amount of time, I'd just do this and add them, instead of making chipotle en adobo or a paste out of them. Just think of them as a spice.  <sep>  Q: What can I do with dried chipotle chillies?

input: CONTEXT: You cooked it at too low a temperature. Sous vide is intended for meat where you want the protein to remain tender. It shouldn't have any sinews. Think chicken breasts, or the long filet along the spine of a pig. This meat gets nicely cooked at 60-65Â°C (depends on the animal), and tough and dry above that. Meat marbled with sinews has to be cooked at a temperature where the sinews (collagen) melt into gelatin. This happens at about 70Â°C at least, and takes hours. Since the muscle fibres are already toughened at that temperature, there is no reason to hold it low; you can put it at full boil in a normal pot and cook it there, you just have to wait long enough. In theory, you could do it in a sous vide bath too, but you won't get any of the benefits sous vide gives to tender meat.  <sep>  Q: I tried cooking sous vide chicken and it came out tough and stringy, can you tell me why?

input: CONTEXT: Yes, ceramic knives are the ""new thing,"" but that doesn't make them superior. The problem with ceramic knives is that you can never sharpen them, and, as mentioned in the comments, they may chip. Don't get a ceramic chef's knife or paring knife; the answer to your question is zero.If you really want a ceramic knife, then buy a ceramic bread knife, although you won't be getting any extra performance for the money.Ceramic blade mandolines, however, are great. The ceramic blade will be sharper and hold the edge longer than a steel mandoline, and since you don't sharpen a mandoline anyway, it doesn't matter that ceramic doesn't sharpen. Note, a separate, and good, question would be ""what knives do I need?"" The answer is it depends, but I concur that you should not buy a ""set"" of knives.  <sep>  Q: How many ceramic knives do I want? A: the answer to your question is zero  Q: Oh really?

input: CONTEXT: With online meat shopping in the UK you have to go with the reputation of the source, there's no grading system which you can refer to. Top end butchers and grocery stores carry top end beef, and most of the time you do get what you pay for. Many supermarket chains have premium labels, ie Tesco Finest and Sainsbury's Taste The Difference, which are definitely much better than their regular stuff, but I think the best mainstream grocery store premium brand for meat is Coop. At the end of the day there's no substitute for getting your own eyes on the meat you are buying, so I would recommend you try local butcher shops. There's still plenty of them around in the UK, and the quality varies dramatically. There are some that will pawn off legs of lamb that are about to turn, and others which control their entire supply chain and have some of the best meat in the world. You just have to try a few and see.  <sep>  Q: As a consumer in the UK, how can I choose well marbled beef?

input: CONTEXT: Both crispy and caramelized onions are cooked for a long time, and will be very brown. However, they are cooked slightly differently.Caramelized onions are usually cross-cut on the onion to release its moisture, and then cooked over very low heat in a crowded pan, stirring infrequently, so that they gradually release their sugars and liquid and it turns to caramel. Depending on the onions and desired result, you may even cover them, an add a little liquid and/or sugar. The end result is very soft and very sweet.Arabic-style crispy onions are cut pole-to-pole in order to avoid rupturing cells in the onions. They are then fried over medium heat in an uncrowded pan, stirring regularly. This lets them dry out and become brown and crispy, even burning on thin ends. These onions should be a mix of crispy and chewy, and more savory than sweet.  <sep>  Q: What is the difference between caramelized onions and ""crispy onions""?

input: CONTEXT: The recipe calls for ground almonds. This can be done in a food processor. You may wish to remove the almonds' skins beforehand, and you also may wish to toast them. Both of those are very common, even though neither is essential. With this particular recipe, I'd be inclined to toast them but leave the skins on. Once you've made those decisions, measure out the sugar called for in the recipe. Set it aside. Then place the almonds in the processor and add two or three heaping tablespoons of the measured sugar. Pulse until you reach a grind that resembles a meal, or very course flour. The finer you grind the almonds, the more carefully you must watch them. Eventually, the almonds will begin to turn to a paste. The sugar is helping to prevent it, and that's helping you to get a finer grind. However, overprocess and the almonds will turn to paste. If you're carefully watching for it, though, you'll see it begin to happen before it goes too far.  <sep>  Q: How do I grind almonds for making marzipan?

input: CONTEXT: Yes, you should store them in a air-tight jar, and the best is to store the jar in a cool place in the house. The fridge is to moist for storing cupcakes. You can store them in the jar for about 3-4 days, but they won't taste fresh any more.

Should I just leave them outside in an air-tight jar? A: So I would suggest if you want to store them longer then 1 or maybe 2 days, freeze them right after they cooled down from baking  Q: so to compare then, for how long will they stay fresh outside, rather than in freezer?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Coriander leaf/cilantro looks VERY similar to flat leaf parsley. When I have both at the house I sometimes resort to smelling them to know which is which. Cilantro is very strong smelling, and you'd definitely change the flavor of the dish if you left it out.Flat leaf parsley is significantly more subtle and has a much milder flavor and scent. It is not flavorless, and in a recipe that calls for a lot of it, you'd really be missing something by leaving it out.When you've got a recipe that calls for both parsley and cilantro, you're definitely going to be more able to taste/smell the cilantro more than parsley, but they'll both contribute different notes. If you have to leave one out, leave out the parsley, but don't try to make up the volume with more cilantro, as you may wind up overpowering your dish. Just leave the parsley out and proceed as normal.Do not use curly leave parsley in anything--it is tough and virtually flavorless. It is ONLY a garnish and not worth wasting your time on.  <sep>  Q: What is the difference between parsley and coriander(cilantro)? A: Coriander leaf/cilantro looks VERY similar to flat leaf parsley.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Fat doesn't spoil like other foods. No bacteria can live in fat. Going rancid is a chemical reaction in which the fat molecules break down. So ""leaving out"" is not a problem. The major factors in going rancid are light and air. The more light hits your fat, the sooner it goes rancid. Also, rancidity occurs when the fat is oxidized, meaning that if you prevent contact with air, your fat will last longer. Both factors are minimized by transferring the fat to a tightly closed opaque container. With liquid oils, you use a dark colored bottle. As bottles are impractical for solid fat, just strain your grease into a jar, close it, and put it in a cupboard. The shelf life should be many months, probably more than a year. Also, don't worry that you can get something nasty when the grease goes bad unnoticed. Rancid fat isn't a big safety risk, and ingesting it in small amounts is not problematic. If it stinks, throw it out. Before that, there is no problem eating it. The above assumes pure, well-strained fat. Pieces of fried meat left over in the fat are a safety risk, even tiny ones.  <sep>  Q: How long does grease take to go bad/rancid when sitting out? A: The more light hits your fat, the sooner it goes rancid  Q: If I make a skillet full of bacon, how long can I leave the grease sitting out before it is unsafe/rancid? A: if you prevent contact with air, your fat will last longer  Q: How long do you think that it's still safe to use? A: If it stinks, throw it out. Before that, there is no problem eating it  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Should I store it in the refrigerator or leave it out?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Mast O Khiar, as you mention mainly consist of plain yogurt and cucumbers and most recipe do not require much more than that. Because of such, the shelf life for the yogurt product will be the shelf life of the yogurt itself. If it is a store bought yogurt, then the shelf life should be about 2 weeks in the refrigerator.Make sure to store the sauce in an air-tight container. Most tubberware should work. Those soup containers from Chinese takeout orders work perfectly.EDIT: After a bit of a debate in cooking chat, I decided to change my answer a little. The reason I said 2 week is because personally I had eaten 2 week old Mast O Khiar. However it could be recipe dependant so it could be different for a different recipe. However it is very easy to tell whether yogurt OR cucumber is bad.Mast O Khiar should have a very fresh/clean aroma. When yogurt turn bad, it releases a rancid smell. If it smells bad, dont eat it.If you see fuzzy mold it's a good idea to throw it out.  <sep>  Q: What is the Shelf life of a yogurt product?

input: CONTEXT: By ""Italian Sausage"" I think you mean the seasoned pork sausage available in many supermarkets throughout the US. I've found that a 30-70 mix of beef and turkey/chicken works reasonably well as a substitute when pork is not available. Beef is too strong a flavor and turkey too weak in its own. Flavor-wise most italian sausage has red wine, fennel, and oregano.  <sep>  Q: What is a non-pork substitute for Italian sausage?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: So, just answering the new part of the question:You can simply season ""over the top"" of the existing seasoning. To do this, you'd go through the normal seasoning process, wiping the pan with oil, heating in a 500F oven, wiping again, heating again. This will fill in the ""holes"" in your seasoning and you'll be able to use the pan again.However, you will also end up with somewhat rough, uneven seasoning on the bottom. This will make things more likely to stick than if you completely reseasoned the pan. You can improve this by scrubbing the bottom of the pan with a mixture of course salt and oil. This will ""sand down"" the seasoning without completely removing it.You should also ask yourself if maybe the original seasoning of the pan wasn't faulty, given that some of it already scrubbed off.  <sep>  Q: Is there a way to re-season a cast iron pan if I scrubbed it all off?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: While I suspect that the formula is mostly reliable if you repeat the experiment with the same person, I found the individual heat sensitivity varies a lot. Most professional cooks and seasoned homemakers can handle (pun intended) higher heat than those who rarely expose their hands to high temperatures. In our home, weâve had heated discussions about whether the dishes in the just finished dishwasher are too hot to touch or not. And this is just one example.If you exclude the differences between individuals, using your own handâs heat sensitivity to gauge a temperature range is absolutely possible (as long as a few degrees donât matter). It takes time and practice - which is usually described as âexperienceâ. I personally donât think in âdegreesâ though, but more in categories like âtoo coldâ / âshould be okâ / âtoo hotâ and a few steps in between. So in short, if you need a precise temperature, get a thermometer. If you are still working on judging by hand, either get a thermometer or plan a few trial-and-error loops. And sometimes the exact temperature is not important for a recipe to work.Using the X-time at Y-distance formula may work, if your heat sensitivity is similar to the authorâs.  <sep>  Q: How accurate is the hand technique for grilling?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Flour (+ water, either directly or from other ingredients such as egg white) gives the pastry structure. As you knead the flour, the gluten network develops and results in elasticity. When cooked, water evaporates from the dough leaving a rigid gluten skeleton. Fat does not mix with water and thus stay in blobs in between the gluten network. This weakens the gluten structure, making the pastry crumble.For this reason, you often see in recipes for shortcrust to avoid overmixing the fat. Buttery biscuits such as shortbread crumble more than crackers, which have more water. The same rationale applies to puff pastry. The thin fat layers are impermeable, so water steam gets trapped and exercise pressure upwards, lifting the pastry up.Quoting @GdD in the comments, the punchline is:more fat = crumblier, less fat has more structure.  <sep>  Q: How does altering the fat-to-flour ratio affect the pastry? A: more fat = crumblier, less fat has more structure  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Is it only crumblier after it bakes?

input: CONTEXT: For ramen, udon, and soba, it is not uncommon for Japanese restaurants to use multiple broths for layered flavors.My friend is from Yamagata in Japan and several of her favorite Udon places will make a sturdy broth with dashi as well as pork and chicken stocks. When I make noodles at home, I almost always start with dashi and fortify with chicken or pork stock. While the aroma of a good dashi is strong, often times it isn't solid enough to feel full-bodied. Try adding other stocks/broths and see where that gets you. Use neckbones and feet if you make your own pork stock.  <sep>  Q: I had delicious Udon soup at a Japanese restaurant, and my attempts to recreate have failed. what am I missing? A: Try adding other stocks/broths and see where that gets you  Q: Would you add chicken, beef, or both?

input: CONTEXT: In my experience, rice can be cooked in any pot. I cook quite a lot of Japanese style dishes, and as far as I can tell the rice is cooked in the same way as any other.For myself, I've done it in good ""induction-able"" steel pots, as well as huge (navy galley) aluminium pots, and a couple of low-quality stainless steel things too. They're all fine.Normally, as soon as the pot is at/near boiling, turn the heat down to a low setting and leave it in the pot until it's ready. Then take it off the heat, but leave it covered (don't peek) for another five minutes.Generally, once you've added the water, you put the lid on. You only start the timer when it's boiled and you turn it down, though. That's probably why a glass lid is better, so you can see the boiling. It's not critical to the process, though.  <sep>  Q: Do I need a specific pot to cook Japanese-style rice? A: In my experience, rice can be cooked in any pot.

input: CONTEXT: It really comes down to taste. In this usage, you're treating sauerkraut like a condiment so there's not really a ""correct"" answer.. A lot of hot dog places have traditions - for instance, Nathan's Famous hot dogs (the original ""Coney Island"" hot dog) uses these combinations with kraut:-Sauerkraut, spicey brown mustard (New York style)-Thousand island dressing, sauerkraut, swiss cheese (Reuben style)A famous hot dog maker in Pennsylvania, Yocco's Famous Dogs, uses sauerkraut and a thin bean chili combination to make their hot dogs.The sauerkraut will often be very strong tasting, but not as ""funky"" as kimchi. It pairs well with a lot of different foods, usually other strong flavors (either strong tart like the spicey mustard, or strong sweet like the thousand island dressing or sweet relish).Personally, I just eat sauerkraut with a fork. But if I have it on a dog, I pile it on with dill relish, country style dijon mustard, a dash of sriracha, and some diced onion. I recommend not kissing anyone for awhile after eating.  <sep>  Q: I have recently started using Sauerkraut for hot dogs. Is this traditionally washed?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: There are two safe ways to defrost, one more rapid than the other.First method is to defrost in the refrigerator. This keeps temperature below 40 degrees F, in the safe zone. This will, also, take a while.Second method is to defrost in the sink under cold running water. The water doesn't have to run rapidly, but it should change regularly. This will defrost the fish more rapidly than in the air (water is a better conductor of heat than air) and will keep the fish in the danger zone for the shortest period of time. If you are not going to cook it immediately, then return to the refrigerator.If you are deep frying, there are some techniques that will allow you to go direct from frozen to fried, but that is generally done in a professional kitchen where they have powerful fryers that can take the temperature hit and come back strong.  <sep>  Q: How do you properly defrost frozen fish?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: While I suspect that the formula is mostly reliable if you repeat the experiment with the same person, I found the individual heat sensitivity varies a lot. Most professional cooks and seasoned homemakers can handle (pun intended) higher heat than those who rarely expose their hands to high temperatures. In our home, weâve had heated discussions about whether the dishes in the just finished dishwasher are too hot to touch or not. And this is just one example.If you exclude the differences between individuals, using your own handâs heat sensitivity to gauge a temperature range is absolutely possible (as long as a few degrees donât matter). It takes time and practice - which is usually described as âexperienceâ. I personally donât think in âdegreesâ though, but more in categories like âtoo coldâ / âshould be okâ / âtoo hotâ and a few steps in between. So in short, if you need a precise temperature, get a thermometer. If you are still working on judging by hand, either get a thermometer or plan a few trial-and-error loops. And sometimes the exact temperature is not important for a recipe to work.Using the X-time at Y-distance formula may work, if your heat sensitivity is similar to the authorâs.  <sep>  Q: How accurate is the hand technique for grilling? A: Most professional cooks and seasoned homemakers can handle (pun intended) higher heat than those who rarely expose their hands to high temperatures  Q: Does this technique work on both a charcoal and propane grill?

This could be combined with differences in heat transfer throughout the batter vs. on the batter-lump transition in preventing rising (I am certain they exist, but I don't know whether they have an effect at all). The result is a hole where the batter didn't rise, surrounded by nicely risen batter. As to where the lump comes from: you say ""chocolate and pear cake"". If you have pear pieces in the batter, right under the surface, they can do this. I have certainly seen it happen when the recipe includes fruit pieces in the batter. If there are no pear pieces, my second guess is badly dissolved flour. The directions for this type of cake normally include folding the whites very gently, and generally erring on the side of too little whisking. This could contribute to uneven batter texture, resulting in lumps. In the second case, the cake may have some less-than-pleasant pieces, but will still be mostly good. If it is fruit, the holes are purely a cosmetic problem. So not much harm done either way, unless you are shooting for a prize at a baking competition.  <sep>  Q: I baked a chocolate and pear cake whose batter is made with yolks, sugar, butter, melted chocolate and amaretti, flour and baking powder and whisked whites. It was (not very evenly) divided in two layers, sandwiching a layer of pear pieces pre-cooked in rum.### My question is: what are the holes due to? A: I have seen this happening more than once. While I don't know the whole theory behind it, each time it happened, there was something just below the hole, let's call it ""the lump  Q: Uneven division of batter?

input: CONTEXT: How exactly are you making them? This might affect the answer.I assume you're using some sort of mold. If that's the case, plunge the mold into an ice bath, but don't completely submerge it. Assuming your mold is metal (molten sugar is hot!) they will cool rather rapidly although I can't give you an exact time.In general, an ice bath is the way to go for rapid cooling. You could get it a little cooler by adding a generous dose of salt to the ice bath, but meh I think you'll only shave a few seconds.  <sep>  Q: What is the best way for cooling melted sugar quickly?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Don't most cake recipes require mixing dry ingredients first? Well, what's been done has been done.The standard professional chef way of getting lumps out of anything is to pass it through a fine strainer. In your case a standard metal pasta strainer should work. Put the strainer over a bowl, pour the batter in and use the back of a large spoon or ladle to gentle press the batter through. The lumps of sugar will be left over and you can just crush them then.Whipping the batter might work the gluten proteins in the flour which will make for a tough chewy texture. Some cakes actually take this into account and others it is bad, so be careful.  <sep>  Q: What can I do with batter that has lumpy sugar in it?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I'm not a professional fudger, but here is my theory: one should add it to the boiling mixture. The reason is that butter has milk solids that are said to âburnâ at low temperatures (somewhere in the range 120C-150C or 250F-300F) which just above the soft ball stage (113C or 235F) needed for making fudge. I interpret the burning to mean that those milk solids (sugars and proteins) get a chance to contribute to the Maillard reaction that gives caramel (and its grained cousin the fudge) its great and rich flavor. Given how unique and varied the flavors arising from butter are, I would not want to miss their contribution by adding them after the heat is gone.  <sep>  Q: Butter usage in fudge?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Scallions are very touchy. You don't want them to dry out, and yet you don't want them too wet or they will get slimy and disgusting.What works best for me is remove any binding holding them together (e.g. rubber band or twisty-tie), (and certainly trim off any parts of the scallions that are already damaged and/or slimy), don't wash until you are ready to use them, wrap the bunch of scallions loosely (but completely covered) in a paper towel, and then store that wrapped bundle in a flimsy plastic bag (maybe the one you brought them home from the supermarket in) in your refrigerator. Sounds ""fussy"" when you lay out all the steps like that, but really, it's not a whole lot of work. Removing the rubber band etc. prevents damage where it would cut into the veg. flesh, paper towel absorbs condensation & liquid water which will rot the scallions (paper towel will prob. become slightly damp after a while in the fridge, but this is OK), plastic bag prevents evaporation of moist air.I find this works well for lots of greens, esp. cilantro - the worst offender in the demanding vegetables category.P.S. If you aren't too squeamish, you can even remove the very outermost layer of a scallion which has begun to ""slime-out"", wash the remainder right before using - & it's fine!  <sep>  Q: How do I preserve scallions? A: Scallions are very touchy. You don't want them to dry out, and yet you don't want them too wet or they will get slimy and disgusting  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: What is the best way to keep them fresh longer?

input: CONTEXT: Adding herbs directly to baked goods usually results in very strong flavours. Infusing the sugar with the herbs gives a more subtle overtone rather than a full-on explosion. In some cases, of course, you might want a strong herb flavour, but where you just want a hint, infusing the sugar is great. The classic example is using stripped vanilla pods to make vanilla sugar, which adds subtle vanilla tones to cakes and meringues.  <sep>  Q: When would one infuse flavor into sugar for baking?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The rest period hydrates the starches in flour, giving the dough a firmer and more workable texture (there is some very minor gluten development, but its mostly the expansion of the starch bundles with water). In many cookies, the flavors will also mature and improve, especially with cocoa in the recipe.In many recipes, the cooling from refrigeration is itself part of the point--doughs may be easier to roll and cut when they are cool due to chilling of the fat. Most dietary fats are waxy, which means they don't have a single set freezing/melting point, but rather get more viscous or eventually firmer then hard as temperature drops.For example, linzer cookie dough is very frangible, and the chilling and hydration make rolling and cutting much easier.Generally, most of this affect is going to happen in the first 8 hours or so. The overnight thing is simply for convenience in most cases. In fact, 4 hours is often enough, although obviously not in your case.If the major effect is chilling in your recipe, by flattening the dough to a disk, or lengthening it to a log (thus increasing surface area) compared to a ball, it will chill more rapidly. You mentioned this is a high fat recipe--if that fat is butter (as it so often is with cookies), that may help.  <sep>  Q: What does an overnight chill do to cookie dough, that a 4 hour chill doesn't? A: Generally, most of this affect is going to happen in the first 8 hours or so. The overnight thing is simply for convenience in most cases. In fact, 4 hours is often enough  Q: Is that true for high fat cookies too? A: Most dietary fats are waxy, which means they don't have a single set freezing/melting point, but rather get more viscous or eventually firmer then hard as temperature drops  Q: I am using a high fat recipe and 4 hours did not make the do workable, why is that? A: flattening the dough to a disk, or lengthening it to a log (thus increasing surface area) compared to a ball, it will chill more rapidly  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: So, if I flatten the dough that will speed up the chilling process?

input: CONTEXT: So, just answering the new part of the question:You can simply season ""over the top"" of the existing seasoning. To do this, you'd go through the normal seasoning process, wiping the pan with oil, heating in a 500F oven, wiping again, heating again. This will fill in the ""holes"" in your seasoning and you'll be able to use the pan again.However, you will also end up with somewhat rough, uneven seasoning on the bottom. This will make things more likely to stick than if you completely reseasoned the pan. You can improve this by scrubbing the bottom of the pan with a mixture of course salt and oil. This will ""sand down"" the seasoning without completely removing it.You should also ask yourself if maybe the original seasoning of the pan wasn't faulty, given that some of it already scrubbed off.  <sep>  Q: How do I repair the seasoning on a cast iron pan?

input: CONTEXT: Mixing it with milk (or liquid in general) is probably just to remove clumps. It clumps easily, especially when things aren't perfectly airtight (probably more common in your grandmother's time), and mixing in a small amount of liquid is an easy way to make sure it all breaks up.I'm less sure about the alternating. It is pretty common to alternate wet and dry as a way of getting things evenly mixed and avoiding lumps, so it's possible it's a variation on that. The paste might be too thick to easily mix into the wet, but also wet enough that it'd tend to stay as a lump if you mix it straight into the dry, so alternating wet-dry-paste might get you more even mixing? But if you're able to mix the paste smoothly into the wet, it's completely fine to just do that.  <sep>  Q: Why pre-mix baking soda into 2 tsp of milk?

As for white pine, I have made delicious tea for breakfast and for the canteen with it while camping and have survived so far. It goes quite well with wild mint.  <sep>  Q: What are the safety considerations in making pine needle tea?

input: CONTEXT: I'd say it depends. If you are dead-set on observing all food safety rules, the pizzas are probably unsafe to eat. But in the real world, it is possible to bend some of those rules and get by unscathed. But you have to be smart about it--not all rules safely bend as far as others.What was on the pizzas? Shrimp? Chicken? Raw sausage? Those things have a pretty short safety window. Cured meats like pepperoni are safer longer (that's why they're cured in the first place).How hot was your kitchen?How long did they sit out?And then of course it comes down also to how long and how hot you're cooking things. You might well be able to kill off germs in things that aren't outright spoiled. Pizza isn't that long-cooking, so there's risk there.Ultimately, you have to be the arbiter of safety. Check the USDA website about food safety and follow every rule if you want to feel certain.  <sep>  Q: I left homemade pizza out overnight, is it still good?

input: CONTEXT: I recently found a different sauce that had a similar butterscotch note to it. It turned out this one was a very simple pan sauce built with brandy and beef stock as a deglazing liquid which was allowed to reduce by about 2/3 and then it was finished with a hint of cream.The fond came from a steak cooked in butter so there was probably a little browned butter in there as well.At this point I think the reduced brandy is a big contributor to the flavor I was identifying as butterscotch.

Any bird's feet are a good choice.The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet. The only thing to keep in mind is that duck feet, like any other duck parts, are substantially more fatty than their chicken equivalents, so assuming you want a clear or mostly-clear stock, you'll have to spend a lot of time skimming.Alternatively you can clean the feet and other bones by boiling them in plain water for 5-10 minutes, then dumping it all out and starting over - which is what your linked recipe suggests. I don't usually do this for brown stocks because you lose a lot of flavour, but if you're starting from raw then it won't make much difference and it's an easy/lazy way to get rid of a lot of the fat at once. <sep> Q: Can I use duck feet to make duck stock A: The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet  Q: Does it add the same flavor and mouth feel?

input: CONTEXT: It might be possible to dissolve the candy, and then boil it down again, foaming it with fresh baking soda when it hits the proper stage. The thing is, the candy has already got the full level of baking soda reactants (either sodium carbonate or sodium oxide) from from the first cooking, which may contribute to some off flavors.Instead, if it is enjoyable as is, I would suggest just eating it as a toffee like candy.Otherwise, chalk it up to experience and watch the temperature more closely next time.  <sep>  Q: What can I do with badly cooked honeycomb?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: From a cooking perspective any imitation sauce or marinade is never going to deliver the quality that venison has to deliver. We have a massive deer farm close and the price is still ridiculous .My suggestion is that you find a good butcher that will age beef for you on the bone ,or you could age it yourself if you have a climate control area to keep it at the correct temperature. Anything over 30 days on the bone will start to give you the gaming flavour you are craving. Nothing is going to match deer, but aged beef or really any type of cattle (eg buffalo etc) will give you the gaminess if it is aged. Restaurants are getting up to 180 days, which I could only imagine would melt in your mouth but the flavour would be intense.  <sep>  Q: Is there any way to add the gamey flavor of venison to other foods I enjoy?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I am going to guess that you are likely getting british or irish breakfast sausage. The national dutch sausage, Frikandel, is minced, skinless, and not usually eaten at breakfast. There is a perception amongst the dutch that Americans eat nothing but meat and fat in huge portions. I did a semester abroad in the Netherlands. For the first few days, the host family fed me eggs and sausages for breakfast. I usually have some toast or cereal for breakfast. So, after a couple days I asked them if this is what they had for breakfast every day. My host mother said, ""No, this is what we were told Americans have for breakfast everyday!""After a chat, they said they were buying British breakfast sausages and eggs for me. Their typical breakfast was a slice of bread, some cheese, and a very strongly flavored liverwurst. My tastes were not as developed back then. After two days of that I asked if there was any other breakfast choices. My host mother bought me suikerbrood. It is a loaf of bread with sugar baked in it. It was delicious! I told them that I enjoyed this new breakfast very much. This caused a lot of chortling for my two host siblings. It turns out that suikerbrood is a small children's breakfast.  <sep>  Q: Do you know the name of small emulsified breakfast sausages served in Dutch countries?

By the time you are done grilling, the chicken should be essentially dry at the surface with nothing left to curdle.The other goal of the grilling (or putting in the tandoor, I imagine, if you have one) is to develop the nice browned and delicious flavors, and that won't happen if there is still liquid yogurt on the surface.Type of yogurtThe particular type of yogurt you use should not be a factor, since it should be fully cooked in the grilling phase.However, in general, very high fat dairly products (like cream, or a yogurt made from full cream).  <sep>  Q: Do you rinse meat after marinating it in yogurt?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: So, just answering the new part of the question:You can simply season ""over the top"" of the existing seasoning. To do this, you'd go through the normal seasoning process, wiping the pan with oil, heating in a 500F oven, wiping again, heating again. This will fill in the ""holes"" in your seasoning and you'll be able to use the pan again.However, you will also end up with somewhat rough, uneven seasoning on the bottom. This will make things more likely to stick than if you completely reseasoned the pan. You can improve this by scrubbing the bottom of the pan with a mixture of course salt and oil. This will ""sand down"" the seasoning without completely removing it.You should also ask yourself if maybe the original seasoning of the pan wasn't faulty, given that some of it already scrubbed off.  <sep>  Q: how do i repair the seasoning on a cast iron pan?

input: CONTEXT: If the yeast isn't out of date then the most likely sounding culprit is the temperature of your water. It should be between 105-110. If it's too cool then you won't activate the yeast and if you get it too warm you'll start to kill it.Another possible case can be when you're adding the salt. If it's going in before or at the same time as the sugar you will arrest the gas production and activity of the yeast.Get the yeast, sugar, water mixture going first and create a shaggy dough with your flour. Add the salt as you're starting to bring the dough together so that it doesn't act too quickly to arrest the yeast development.If you keep your flour in the freezer or refrigerator, make sure it has come to room temperature before adding it to the water or the chill of the flour will de-activate the yeast.  <sep>  Q: Why does my pizza dough rise so inconsistently?

input: CONTEXT: I am going to guess that you are likely getting british or irish breakfast sausage. The national dutch sausage, Frikandel, is minced, skinless, and not usually eaten at breakfast. There is a perception amongst the dutch that Americans eat nothing but meat and fat in huge portions. I did a semester abroad in the Netherlands. For the first few days, the host family fed me eggs and sausages for breakfast. I usually have some toast or cereal for breakfast. So, after a couple days I asked them if this is what they had for breakfast every day. My host mother said, ""No, this is what we were told Americans have for breakfast everyday!""After a chat, they said they were buying British breakfast sausages and eggs for me. Their typical breakfast was a slice of bread, some cheese, and a very strongly flavored liverwurst. My tastes were not as developed back then. After two days of that I asked if there was any other breakfast choices. My host mother bought me suikerbrood. It is a loaf of bread with sugar baked in it. It was delicious! I told them that I enjoyed this new breakfast very much. This caused a lot of chortling for my two host siblings. It turns out that suikerbrood is a small children's breakfast.  <sep>  Q: Small emulsified breakfast sausages in Dutch countries?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: In the fridge, an hour should not be a problem, but could still end up bitter depending on the kind of onion used. Usually, Marinades, Pestos etc. that use mashed onions and/or garlic taste best if they are made the way the name ""Pesto"" suggests: Cutting stuff very fine, then using a mortar and pestle. Most explanations WHY that is the case have to with the fact that blenders tend to disintegrate cell walls with relatively rough cuts of a fast but half-sharp or blunt blade, releasing more enzymes etc. from the cell walls as opposed to from the cell contents. These are plausible, since some of the compounds in different parts of onion cells are known to actively react when the onion is disintegrated.Also, try adding oil (which you often want in a marinade anyway. No unrefined olive oil in a blender, though - that is known to get bitter!) while mortaring or blending - this will help extract flavor compounds and probably provide some oxidation protection.There is a well known marinade working with onions, garlic etc: Bulgogi marinade.  <sep>  Q: How long can blended onions stay relatively fresh? A: In the fridge, an hour should not be a problem, but could still end up bitter depending on the kind of onion used  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: what happens if you leave them longer than an hour?

input: CONTEXT: It could be the proving time or the oven temperature or both.In hotter climates, bread dough will rise faster. Poking the dough will not harm the dough in any way, so don't be afraid to poke the dough. The best way to test if the bread dough has risen enough is by poking it. As for the oven, if the temperature is too low, it can take longer to get additional rise in the oven. What I do, as do many other bread bakers, is to bake the bread at the hottest temperature it can reach for the first ten minutes, then turn it down to the regular temperature for the remainder of the time needed to bake the bread. The hotter temperature initially can result in more oven spring for the bread.  <sep>  Q: what are the Bread Proving Time in Warm Climates?

input: CONTEXT: Yes, you can use eggs well past their ""sell by"" date.

A: Steaming generally doesn't make meat juicier -- it is just as easy to dry out a piece of meat with wet heat as it is with dry heat, if not easier  Q: What's one thing I can do to make my turkey juicier? A: There are two things that you can do to make your turkey juicier  Q: What's one of those things I can do? A: The first is a brine  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: What's the other strategy I can use here?

input: CONTEXT: What you're describing is something that I'd consider normal in a cookie. Some cookies are more cake-like, some are chewy, some are crunchy, some are flatter than others - but they're all good. Almost any factor - from the type of fat, to the type of liquid, to the leavener, to the temperature of both the oven and the dough can affect the cookie's texture. I'd make two recommendations if you want your cookie less flat: 1) chill the dough for a few hours, or overnight. Then, form them and get them into the oven quickly, while the dough is stone cold. 2) Try a different recipe. Do a visual internet search for the type of cookie that you're after. Good recipes are hard to find, and sometimes you have to kiss a few frogs...  <sep>  Q: Why aren't my chocolate chip cookies coming out the way I'd like them?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Yes, you can definitely use UHT milk in bread. UHT is not usable for some applications, because its proteins have been changed by the heat. But in bread, you don't need the proteins from the milk. Bread recipes include milk to make the dough richer, so it is mostly the fat content that matters. Using UHT won't change anything in the dough structure. I even think that the usual unpleasant taste won't be noticeable, but I am not so sure about that. Still, it gets diluted a lot in dough, so if you can drink UHT as-is, you shouldn't have a problem with the bread taste.  <sep>  Q: Can I bake bread with long-life milk?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Anything susceptible to moisture will go stale if exposed to air long enough. Storage will only get you so far, depending on the temperature and humidity in the storage area. In a restaurant kitchen, I don't have to tell you that both are rather high.I'd suggest blanching them after cutting. You could basically cook them through then store them in a relatively air-tight container for a period of several days. When a customer orders chips you'd just drop the blanched chips in the deep fryer long enough to brown and crisp them. This is what essentially every restaurant outfit that serves chips and/or french fries does and it works well. Experiment with blanching temperatures and liquids to see what works best.  <sep>  Q: I was wondering what the best way to store my homemade potato chips?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The term is not really defined that way. In the strict sense, it only has meaning for lean doughs - made of only flour, water, yeast and salt, eventually preferments or later mixins like seeds. You can extend it to enriched doughs (those that have fat, milk, eggs, tomato juice, etc.) but then it is no longer sharply defined. Calculating the exact content of water (e.g. adding to the calculation 17 g of water for every 100 g of butter) are pretty useless, because the water bound in an emulsion or other kind of colloid doesn't behave the same way as free water when making a dough. So, a dough with 100 g water and 100 g butter will be extremely different from a dough with 117 g of water, and still pretty different from one with 117 g of water and 83 g of oil. So, there is no real formula any more to create an actual percentage. The concept still stays somewhat useful in this case, but you have to ""play it by ear"". When you are trying to judge how soft a given enriched dough will be, you can start by calculating all the liquid and fat ingredients as if they were ""hydration"", which gives you a rough guide to compare it to other doughs, and then you have to make it and gain a tactile understanding of how it actually behaves.  <sep>  Q: What counts as ""hydration"" when figuring Dough Hydration? A: The term is not really defined that way. In the strict sense, it only has meaning for lean doughs  Q: So it won't work for an enriched dough? A: You can extend it to enriched doughs (those that have fat, milk, eggs, tomato juice, etc.) but then it is no longer sharply defined  Q: Would sour cream count as a liquid?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Yes it should - sort of. Your observation is right on point, a very rich dough will tear more easily. (I did the same experiment once myself.) But it will still show some characteristics of the windowpane test: it will stretch smoothly and the ""pane"" should be very even, not show streaks of thicker and thinner areas. Note that the temperature of your dough and thus the consistency of your fat may have an influence as well. While warm doughs with soft fat will be very stretchy, cool doughs (made with cold ingredients and little yeast for an overnight cold raise) can be less cooperative.If you are familiar with how a ""ready"" non-enriched dough looks that passes the windowpane test, you will probably recognise the same smoothness in an enriched dough anyway, without performing the test. For this specific recipe, I guess it's the very low hydration that makes the windowpane test difficult and the dough prone to tearing, not the fat.  <sep>  Q: Should enriched doughs pass the windowpane test?

input: CONTEXT: There is a significant difference in how the two operate.Turkish coffee works by heating the water to a boil, with no added pressure. The coffee, with gronds, is then transferred into a cup to seethe, before drinking.In a mocha pot, pressure will typically rise to as much as 1.5 bar, and the resulting liquid is free of grounds.Given the radically different extraction methods, the end result of the two are likely to be radically different. My experience, taken from memory, follows:Turkish coffee goes through a sequence of mouth feels, from completely clear, to grainy, almost muddy, with coffee grounds. This also affects the flavour of the coffee. At the beginning, it is much like a strong filter brew, but tends to get bitter towards the end of the cup, which is also, in part, why it is traditionally served in very small cups. In addition, it is often spiced with cardamom, and often sweetened with sugar.Coffee from a mocha pot has a consistent mouth feel all the way through the cup, as the grounds are left in the pot. Due to the pressurised extraction, the flavour notes are closer to an espresso than filter coffee.  <sep>  Q: Is there a significant difference between Turkish coffee and Moka pot coffee? A: Given the radically different extraction methods, the end result of the two are likely to be radically different  Q: Since the Turkish coffee and the Moka pot both work by boiling/steaming the coffee, so assuming they are from the same bean, is there a significant difference between the two? A: Coffee from a mocha pot has a consistent mouth feel all the way through the cup, as the grounds are left in the pot  Q: How else would you described the difference between the two?

input: CONTEXT: I'm not sure I've ever seen chipotle paste called for in recipes; I searched around a bit and what I found was consistent with my experience. I saw chipotle en adobo, ground chipotle, and even whole dried chipotle. I also easily found recipes for chipotle en adobo. I don't think you'll have any trouble figuring out what to do with them.The most common way I've seen chipotles, both in grocery stores and in recipes, is chipotle en adobo. You can make your own by simmering dried chipotles in tomato paste with vinegar, garlic, onion (search for recipes if that's not specific enough). I suspect that most chipotle pastes you might find are something like this, but pureed, and possibly cooked until thicker.The other common way to use chipotles is as a powder; that's as easy as grinding them in a spice grinder. If you're using them in something that gets cooked for a decent amount of time, I'd just do this and add them, instead of making chipotle en adobo or a paste out of them.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Garlic flavors are soluble in oil, simply chopping up garlic and putting it in with the rice will not distribute the flavor well. I would recommend you chop the garlic finely and then infuse into a tablespoon of oil or butter by putting the pan on very low heat for a few minutes. Then add the rice and stir to coat the grains with the infused oil before adding water and cooking as normal. How much garlic to use depends on how strong your garlic is and how garlic-y you want it to taste. 5 tbsp of rice isn't much, for a medium garlic flavor using average strength garlic a whole small clove or half a large is probably enough. With the garlic I grow I'd add a few slices from a clove at most. Another option would be to cook the rice and then stir in the garlic infused oil afterwards, The benefits to this option are that you can drain the rice after cooking without all the flavor going down the drain.  <sep>  Q: What is the best way to infuse garlic flavor in the bland brown rice? A: I would recommend you chop the garlic finely and then infuse into a tablespoon of oil or butter by putting the pan on very low heat for a few minutes  Q: How much would you use for 5 tbs of uncooked rice?

input: CONTEXT: If the flour is self-rising flour, then it shouldn't be allowed to sit for too long. However, this wouldn't result in it being ""impossible to pour"" - it would just prevent the item(s) from rising properly when baked.If I had to guess, I would point to the chocolate as the culprit. If your batter/dough recipe uses melted chocolate (as opposed to just cocoa powder) then it is almost certainly going to solidify again as it cools. In which case, you can simply heat it again (gently - you don't want cook the eggs!) to loosen it up a little before pouring it.  <sep>  Q: Can brownie dough sit?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: To clarify: forced-air (a/k/a ""convection"", a/k/a ""fan bake"") ovens rely on a fan to circulate the air in the oven. The fast-moving air substantially enhances the rate at which heat is transferred to the food. It is particularly good where you want the surface to brown, such as roasts and breads; it is not as good for more delicate items, such as custards and cakes, which can set too quickly or get dried out. For cookies, it depends on what effect you want, but many standard types do well in forced-air ovens because the fan helps ensure that the whole oven stays at a uniform temperature despite the presence of several trays. (Of course, the tray closest to the heating element will still cook faster than the one farthest away, so you will still have to swap them partway through.)The general rule for using the fan is to set the oven temperature 25 degrees F (15 C) lower than what the recipe calls for using in a regular oven. Even then, don't go strictly by cooking time, as ovens vary; rather, be sure to check on your food regularly to see how fast it is cooking. You may need to cover your food to prevent over-browning, or perhaps adjust the oven temperature.  <sep>  Q: Is it better to use a fan when baking ? A: It is particularly good where you want the surface to brown, such as roasts and breads  Q: Should the fan be on high or low speed ? A: it depends on what effect you want  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: what are the cases when it is better to not use a fan ?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Short answer: No.Long answer: this could probably be made to work, but only for a short time. At some point, and probably within a few uses, the rapid heat cycling from the fire would cause the pizza stone to crack.Pizza stones are made from corderite or clay, sometimes with grog. This offers a smoother surface than firebrick, but that smooth surface is because of a higher amount of vitrification and less airspace in the ceramic. This means they are less resistant to cracking due thermal shock, and the fact that your pizza stone is 1/4 a thick as firebrick makes that worse.In contrast, firebrick is a standard 2.5"" thick, and made from higher-temperature materials with more airspace in the clay itself. These properties give it both higher thermal insulation, and higher thermal mass (so that it cools down slower). Both of these properties help it resist cracking.  <sep>  Q: Would you suggest using floor pizza oven or a firebrick? A: Short answer: No  Q: Can i use a pizza stone 3/4 inch as the pizza floor?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: You cooked it at too low a temperature. Sous vide is intended for meat where you want the protein to remain tender. It shouldn't have any sinews. Think chicken breasts, or the long filet along the spine of a pig. This meat gets nicely cooked at 60-65Â°C (depends on the animal), and tough and dry above that. Meat marbled with sinews has to be cooked at a temperature where the sinews (collagen) melt into gelatin. This happens at about 70Â°C at least, and takes hours. Since the muscle fibres are already toughened at that temperature, there is no reason to hold it low; you can put it at full boil in a normal pot and cook it there, you just have to wait long enough. In theory, you could do it in a sous vide bath too, but you won't get any of the benefits sous vide gives to tender meat.  <sep>  Q: I tried cooking sous vide chicken and it came out tough and stringy, can you tell me why? A: Sous vide is intended for meat where you want the protein to remain tender. It shouldn't have any sinews  Q: I tried cooking it at 60C, is that the correct temperature? A: This meat gets nicely cooked at 60-65Â°C (depends on the animal), and tough and dry above that  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: How long should I cook chicken breasts at that temperature?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: There could be two factors involved. First, the freshness of the celery. Restaurants, especially those that serve large amounts, are going through a lot of product. This means that you are more likely to get really fresh celery.Next, storing in water is very likely an issue. I would suggest buying celery within a day or so of when you plan to use it. Wash and dry it thoroughly. Then trim and cut to your desired size. Then immediately place the celery in a plastic container or zipper bag and place in the refigerator until serving.Each time you take it out for serving, remove the amount you plan to use and return the rest to the refrigerator. The 'leftover' celery should remain fresh and crisp for several days.  <sep>  Q: Why does raw celery from a restaurant taste different than raw celery at home?###Say you go to a restaurant and order buffalo wings. The wings come with celery and bleu cheese. The celery tastes amazing.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: As you probably know, volkornbrot and similar breads are designed to bake at a lower temperature for a longer time. 240 C sounds way too high to me. 150-180 C should be about right, and leave the bread in for a long time (up to 3 hours), until the loaf starts to pull away from the sides of the pan. Even after this baking process, because the bread batter is much wetter than a standard bread, you should not slice or eat the bread until it has had time to cool and ""rest,"" about 24 hours. If you slice it right away, the heat and moisture escape and the inside is still doughy/raw. If you wait, the moisture will have time to distribute throughout the loaf and the inside will firm up. Just be patient! The benefit is that the loaf should last for a very long time wrapped in plastic, especially if you put the unused portion in the fridge.  <sep>  Q: I tried to make black bread in the microwave, but why didn't it work?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: In my experience, the most likely impact of a gentle boil vs. a furious rolling boil is going to be on texture of starchy foods, such as potatoes or other root vegetables, rather than flavor.I've found that a gentle simmer of potatoes will result in a mostly intact shape and consistent texture, whereas an aggressive boil without perfect timing can result in the outer layers of the potato breaking apart, sometimes before the center has time to cook fully.I've seen similar issues with stuffed parcels of pasta like ravioli or boiled won tons. I've also found that open pot egg poached eggs have much nicer results with a gentle simmer than an aggressive boil, perhaps for related reasons.Since part of how we experience taste is texture, you could say that the ""taste"" is affected.  <sep>  Q: Can food be boiled ""extra fast/hard"" in water?

I suppose it could make a difference if it was a hot pack vs. cold pack, but I would still not risk it.Since you're an experienced canner, I assume you already know that it's possible to lose pressure during the process and then restart the time when the canner gets back up to pressure, but that is usually a few minutes at most, not hours.  <sep>  Q: If there was an interruption in canning process, would the meat still be safe?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: It really depends on your audience and setting. With a Filipino Lechon, it's served communally and eaten as pulled pork, so it's expected that you'll just plunk it down on a side table, and people will crack through the crisp, almost hard, skin and pull servings for themselves with tongs or forks. And they'll go for the whole thing, skin, ears, jowls and all (most people I know don't eat the ears, but they may crunch the crispy skin off them).A similar thing is done with a country-style hog roast. Those may be skinned before serving, but generally you're responsible for pulling or slicing what you want right off the hog (and usually throwing it on a cheapo burger bun). In both of these settings there are almost always some people who don't want to dig right into the pig out of squeamishness or out of fear of getting some part that's not nice to eat. The good host will periodically pull some of the good stuff onto a platter for those folks.If you're doing something more formal, I guess you'd want to section it like Foodrules suggests.  <sep>  Q: What is the best process to serve a whole pre-cooked pig I got from the butchers?

input: CONTEXT: Yes, you can roast the beans some more. However the results will probably not be great. Roasting results in quite a bit of smoke. If you are going low tech, I would do it in a wok in a very well ventilated area. It's pretty easy to set off smoke detectors. A stove top with a range hood might be good enough if you have a particularly good range hood. Outside with the wok on a BBQ is probably best.Roast over a low heat and stir continuously. You want to get the beans as even as possible, trying not to burn them. The beans will continue to roast after taking them off the heat. So stop one or two roast levels before the desired colour and tip your beans out into a colander and continue stirring to cool. The residual heat will cook the bean some more. To aim for a desired roast level, compare the current roast colour to your desired roast colour and maybe to a roast level chart. Google image search ""coffee roast level chart"". Guesstimate the roast level that is one or two levels below your desired colour to stop at.Once again there will be a lot of smoke.  <sep>  Q: How to improve the taste of sour coffee beans?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I'd say that's not strictly true,mostly because no salt substitute I've ever seen can get the same taste anyway. ""Real"" salt is sodium chloride (and maybe iodine, or minor impurities if it's sea salt). Most salt substitutes are partly or mostly potassium chloride. This is technically a salt (chemically speaking) and does have a similar salty taste, but it doesn't taste quite like sodium chloride, and can be bitter or metallic-tasting. Some salt substitutes add herbs or other things to help make the potassium chloride more palatable. Sounds like your has some ""regular"" salt as well, if it's got a significant sodium content.So while you are right that there's likely a ""catch,"" it's more likely to be that your salt substitute will never taste quite right, or will be bitter, and less likely that you'll be piling loads of extra on in an effort to get the right saltiness.  <sep>  Q: Is low sodium salt really effective? A: no salt substitute I've ever seen can get the same taste anyway  Q: do you add more to get the full flavor? A: you'll be piling loads of extra on in an effort to get the right saltiness  Q: is there another ingredient i can use? A: Some salt substitutes add herbs or other things to help make the potassium chloride more palatable  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: is the stuff healthy for you?

I can get pretty decent results just hitting it with my cutting board. (with it between saran wrap).Part of it might be technique -- if I'm doing chicken breast I first slice is sort of following the taper of the breast, so it's neither with or across the grain, but kinda of diagonal. You also don't want to hit straight down -- you want to angle the blows, so you're actually pushing the meat out, and not just trying to force it through the counter.And I should mention that I've only ever pounded out poultry and pork -- I assume beef would be the same, but I have no experience to confirm or deny it.  <sep>  Q: How do I pound chicken (or other meat) without making a mess?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Yes, you can definitely use UHT milk in bread. UHT is not usable for some applications, because its proteins have been changed by the heat. But in bread, you don't need the proteins from the milk. Bread recipes include milk to make the dough richer, so it is mostly the fat content that matters. Using UHT won't change anything in the dough structure. I even think that the usual unpleasant taste won't be noticeable, but I am not so sure about that. Still, it gets diluted a lot in dough, so if you can drink UHT as-is, you shouldn't have a problem with the bread taste.  <sep>  Q: Can I bake bread with long-life milk?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I understand that sugar (and by extension jaggery) helps yeast multiply at a very fast paceThis is only partly true. Yeast is a living organism and can only live under certain conditions, including a certain osmotic pressure. If you start from pure bread dough, then adding a bit of sugar to the dough (or to the preferment) can make it rise faster. But adding sugar in quantities sufficient to make the bread taste sweet will slow down the yeast growth, as opposed to making it quicker. There is even an upper limit for how much sugar you can add per 100 g of flour, and it's not recommended to use recipes which prescribe more, as they turn out poorly. So I wouldn't change the amount of yeast, unless you make the empirical observation that your yeast is overfed (recognizable by speed of raising and the changed smell).  <sep>  Q: Should I decrease the amount of yeast I add depending on how much sweet I add (I use jaggery) while making sweet bread?

input: CONTEXT: What you're describing is something that I'd consider normal in a cookie. Some cookies are more cake-like, some are chewy, some are crunchy, some are flatter than others - but they're all good. Almost any factor - from the type of fat, to the type of liquid, to the leavener, to the temperature of both the oven and the dough can affect the cookie's texture. I'd make two recommendations if you want your cookie less flat: 1) chill the dough for a few hours, or overnight. Then, form them and get them into the oven quickly, while the dough is stone cold. 2) Try a different recipe. Do a visual internet search for the type of cookie that you're after. Good recipes are hard to find, and sometimes you have to kiss a few frogs...  <sep>  Q: Why aren't my chocolate chip cookies coming out the way I'd like them?

input: CONTEXT: Chilis supply 2 things, chili flavor and heat. The flavor comes from the flesh while the heat comes from the seeds and especially the membrane that connects the seeds to the flesh. Ordinarily when someone wants to reduce the heat of a pepper I would suggest cutting it open and removing the seeds and membrane, however that's pretty much impossible with a dried pepper. My recommendation in this case would be to put the chipotles in whole, then remove them after cooking is done. Put the peppers in after all the other ingredients, just before simmering, then try to avoid stirring it if you can avoid it - be gentle so you don't burst the peppers open.

input: CONTEXT: Nutrition itself is off-topic. However, keep in mind the following:There are many compounds in tea leaves and some dissolve early, and some a little later. At some point (around 5-10 minutes of steeping at ~95Â°C), you will lose majority of the 'good stuff' and continue picking up less desirable compounds. You will notice that while colour might persist, the taste will be come less and less desirable.

input: CONTEXT: Basmati is classic. I am particularly fond of brown basmati rice, which has more flavor than white basmati, but it takes longer to cook and will go rancid after 6 months. If basmati is not available, any long-grain rice will suffice; short-grain rice tends to be too sticky. As for technique, rinse the rice until the rinse-water runs clear. For every cup of rice, use 2 cups of water and 1/2 tsp salt. Bring the water to a boil; add the rice and salt and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook covered until the liquid has been absorbed and the texture of the rice is tender.For additions to the rice, you have LOADS of options. You can add a pinch of saffron to the water for a vibrant yellow color and distinctive floral aroma (if you just want color, add 1/2 tsp ground turmeric). You can add chunks of peeled ginger, cracked peppercorns, whole peeled garlic cloves, whole cardamom pods, whole cloves, whole bay leaves, whole kaffir lime leaves, and/or whole stick cinnamon -- amounts and combinations are entirely up to your taste (just remember to remove any bay leaves before serving; remove the others or not as you like, but bay is inedible). You can also add cooked vegetables, such as peas, butter beans, pearl onions, and/or carrots.  <sep>  Q: What kind of rice to serve with Indian Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhani)? A: Basmati is classic.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Both crispy and caramelized onions are cooked for a long time, and will be very brown. However, they are cooked slightly differently.Caramelized onions are usually cross-cut on the onion to release its moisture, and then cooked over very low heat in a crowded pan, stirring infrequently, so that they gradually release their sugars and liquid and it turns to caramel. Depending on the onions and desired result, you may even cover them, an add a little liquid and/or sugar. The end result is very soft and very sweet.Arabic-style crispy onions are cut pole-to-pole in order to avoid rupturing cells in the onions. They are then fried over medium heat in an uncrowded pan, stirring regularly. This lets them dry out and become brown and crispy, even burning on thin ends. These onions should be a mix of crispy and chewy, and more savory than sweet.  <sep>  Q: What is the difference between caramelized onions and ""crispy onions""?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I've never tried steaming bok choy, but yes, the ribs and leafy bits cook at different speeds.For stir frys I trim the bottom so the ribs come free, clean off any dirt that's gotten trapped in between, then stack up the leaves and cut the leaves from the ribs. I slice the ribs into about 5mm / 3/16"" slices, and add them towards the end; the leaves I cut into ribbons (perpendicular to the ribs), and stir them in at the last second, so they barely cook. The center I just chop the top off the leafy bit, and slice the more rib-like bits a litte larger than the rest of the ribs (they're thinner, so cook faster).As I've never tried steaming it, and I don't tend to cook in bags (except for silver turtles when camping), this is going to be a complete guess. Now, it tastes fine al dente, so you could leave the ribs as large as I use for a stir fry, but en papillote tends to be fancier cooking, so I'd probably try for maybe 1/6"" slices or a little thicker (maybe 2-3mm), and if you had a mandoline so they all came out even, that'd be great. I'd still cut the leaves into ribbons, just because it's easier to eat than a huge intact leaf.I'd assume that the leaves would cook at a similar rate as spinich, and the ribs closer to fennel, if that helps at all.  <sep>  Q: How should I prepare Bok Choy before I cook it? A: trim the bottom so the ribs come free, clean off any dirt that's gotten trapped in between, then stack up the leaves and cut the leaves from the ribs  Q: Ok. How should I cook the Bok Choy after I prepare it? A: stir them in at the last second, so they barely cook  Q: Will the leaf cook faster than the rib? A: I'd assume that the leaves would cook at a similar rate as spinich, and the ribs closer to fennel  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Would the preparation be different if I wanted to prepare Bok Choy for another dish?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Gelatin sheets are soaked in cold-to-room-temp water in order to soften and rehydrate them slightly before stirring them into the (often hot) food. If you were to try to stir a sheet of gelatin directly into hot liquid, you'd find that it behaves a lot like cornstarch. It clumps up immediately and produces unpleasant-to-eat chunks that only a blender and a chinois have a hope of removing.You squeeze it after soaking to remove excess (unflavored) water from the exterior. Otherwise, each sheet might bring along quite a bit of water, which will seriously affect the consistency of a product you expect to set up, and might affect the taste of even something like a braise to which you are adding the gelatin just for body.  <sep>  Q: Why do we soak and squeeze gelatine?

input: CONTEXT: Marshmallows expand so much because the water in them becomes steam, and gas takes up a LOT more volume than liquid. Specifically, 1 mL of water becomes ~1.36 LITERS of vapor, before it gets heated further. That's 1000-fold expansion, before you add additional expansion as the gas is heated. Marshmallows don't have all that much water content, but when it's trapped in a stretchy gelatin matrix that holds gas readily, it only takes a bit to blow the whole thing up like a balloon.You are correct that the gas expansion on its own is insufficient; unless I've badly muddled my calculations, gas expansion from 20C to ~150C (caramelization temperature) will increase the gas volume by under 50%.  <sep>  Q: Why do marshmallows poof up so huge when put in the microwave?

input: CONTEXT: The professional (read: industrial) solution would be maltodextrin powder. It is rather tasteless, has good solubility in liquids, and doesn't change much texturewise. In homemade spice mixes, the popular filler solution are dried breadcrumbs of a very small size (like breadcrumbs for schnitzel breading). They are noticeable, because the mix gets gritty, but the consensus among those who do it is that this is a feature, not a bug. They could also slightly thicken a wet dish (soup, stew), but present no problem when strewn over dry food. You can also use a nut flour made of nuts without much of an own taste, like apricot kernels or low quality overdried almonds.

Epoxy is harder than other plastics, but there are epoxies that are BPA free anywayAluminium cans are more likely have a epoxy liner that will give off a trace of BPAMany steel cans do not use epoxy or other BPA plasticsHaving said that the tested BPA release from a can is 100's of times lower than the recommended maximum daily dose. So in theory there is nothing to really worry aboutThe common sense answer is, if epoxy dissolved into the cans contents they wouldn't use it would they. The whole reason it's there is to stop the contents 'eating' the can  <sep>  Q: Is there a definitive way to know if a tin can is lined with BPA? A: Probably not.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Your best choices would be top sirloin (#1 choice), tenderloin, or one of the other (less expensive) sirloin cuts. Those cuts will be tender, flavorful, and without pockets of fat or gristle to mar the appearance of your dish.I don't recommend round because I simply don't like its flavor. Using round in this application might be one of the best applications to use up round, but for the best possible beef bowl, I'd go with the sirloin or tenderloin.TIP: To thinly slice meat, put it in the freezer first until it just starts to get hard (not even close to fully frozen), or start with meat that is only partially defrosted. Partially frozen meat is much easier to neatly and thinly slice. For this application, thin even slices really are important, they make for a much nicer presentation.  <sep>  Q: What cut of beef can I use to make ""sukiyaki beef""?

input: CONTEXT: Iron is simply an element, so it cannot be destroyed by cooking (or generally temperature changes), as vitamins and other organic structures potentially can.Cooked spinach inevitably has a much lower water content, thus the relative density of all other components must increase.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: No, it won't work. Michael's comment explains why. Whipping cream is not just fat and water mixed, it is fat and water emulsified. This is a big difference. If you had some special reason to do this on a regular basis, you could get it to work by adding emulsifiers. You can beat any fat with water and lecithine or xanthan and get a creamy result. As far as I know, this is how plant based cream substitutes work. But if the issue is that you just don't have whipping cream right now at home, then it is easier to go buy whipping cream than to go find emulsifiers (I buy mine online, don't know if there are brick-and-mortar B2C stores which sell them). If for some reason you absolutely can't do it in time, I would suggest using a different filling. Pastry cream works well with millefeulle, buttercream can work too, lightened with whipped eggwhites if necessary.  <sep>  Q: Could I add butter to single cream to make whipped/double cream? A: it won't work  Q: If I added butter to single cream and whipped it, would that add enough butterfat to it to make it suitable for whipping? A: Whipping cream is not just fat and water mixed, it is fat and water emulsified  Q: What is the best way to make whipping cream from cream? A: you could get it to work by adding emulsifiers  Q: What are good emulsifiers to add to single cream, if I want to make whipping cream?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Scallions are very touchy. You don't want them to dry out, and yet you don't want them too wet or they will get slimy and disgusting.What works best for me is remove any binding holding them together (e.g. rubber band or twisty-tie), (and certainly trim off any parts of the scallions that are already damaged and/or slimy), don't wash until you are ready to use them, wrap the bunch of scallions loosely (but completely covered) in a paper towel, and then store that wrapped bundle in a flimsy plastic bag (maybe the one you brought them home from the supermarket in) in your refrigerator. Sounds ""fussy"" when you lay out all the steps like that, but really, it's not a whole lot of work. Removing the rubber band etc. prevents damage where it would cut into the veg. flesh, paper towel absorbs condensation & liquid water which will rot the scallions (paper towel will prob. become slightly damp after a while in the fridge, but this is OK), plastic bag prevents evaporation of moist air.I find this works well for lots of greens, esp. cilantro - the worst offender in the demanding vegetables category.P.S. If you aren't too squeamish, you can even remove the very outermost layer of a scallion which has begun to ""slime-out"", wash the remainder right before using - & it's fine!  <sep>  Q: How do I preserve scallions? A: Scallions are very touchy. You don't want them to dry out, and yet you don't want them too wet or they will get slimy and disgusting  Q: What is the best way to keep them fresh longer?

input: CONTEXT: It is not simply a matter of strong versus weak. Rather, different qualities are extracted from the coffee over different parts of the brewing process. The most volatile components are extracted early in the brew, and the less volatile components come out over the length of the brew.So the distribution of flavors varies over the brew. Total brew time is carefully calibrated in quality coffee makers to extract the most desirable flavors possible, and minimize the least desirable.By taking some out early, you are guaranteed a bad first cup, and are consigning the remainder of the pot to be less than it could be.For best quality, you should wait for the entire brew, so that the flavors are balanced from the entire brew time.  <sep>  Q: Which part of the coffee brew is best?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: There are two safe ways to defrost, one more rapid than the other.First method is to defrost in the refrigerator. This keeps temperature below 40 degrees F, in the safe zone. This will, also, take a while.Second method is to defrost in the sink under cold running water. The water doesn't have to run rapidly, but it should change regularly. This will defrost the fish more rapidly than in the air (water is a better conductor of heat than air) and will keep the fish in the danger zone for the shortest period of time. If you are not going to cook it immediately, then return to the refrigerator.If you are deep frying, there are some techniques that will allow you to go direct from frozen to fried, but that is generally done in a professional kitchen where they have powerful fryers that can take the temperature hit and come back strong.  <sep>  Q: How do you properly defrost frozen fish?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I'm sorry to say this, but I think prevention is the best answer. Once you're vegetables freeze things happen at the cellular level that changes the nature of the vegetables. For example, ice crystals pierce cell walls which destroys some of the structure, which is responsible for the crispness and crunch of the vegetable. I don't think there is really a way to ""fix"" this, once it happens.That said, cooking does something similar to vegetables. Cooking destroys cell walls, which is why cooked carrots are so much softer than raw carrots. I would think that vegetables that stand up to cooking would survive freezing the best (such as your mushrooms).

input: CONTEXT: It's my opinion that the ""proper temperature"" is a number set by lawyers, not by chefs. The government standard for a roast bird is 180Â°F (83Â°C)! Are you kidding me? HTST pasteurization is 161Â°F (72Â°C) for 20 seconds, but my turkey has to get to 180Â°F for safe human consumtion? What the hell kind of bacteria do they think live in there?165Â°F (74Â°C) is a common number, and a pretty decent one, though I always take mine out before that for the reason below.You need to remember that the internal temperature of the bird will continue to rise for a while after you take it out of the oven: the heat on the outside is still migrating inward. If you wait to take it out until the internal temperature is the ""right"" temperature, by the time it peaks, it'll be 10Â°F (~5Â°C) HIGHER than the right temperature, and that's in the dry zone. We're talking 190Â°F (88Â°C) thanksgiving football. Blech.Dark meat almost always handles being overcooked better than lighter meat. The breast is the hardest part of the turkey to cook correctly.

input: CONTEXT: Nutrition itself is off-topic. However, keep in mind the following:There are many compounds in tea leaves and some dissolve early, and some a little later. At some point (around 5-10 minutes of steeping at ~95Â°C), you will lose majority of the 'good stuff' and continue picking up less desirable compounds. You will notice that while colour might persist, the taste will be come less and less desirable. In some cultures re-using tea leaves is considered a faux-pas because of this.If you find your tea to be too strong after steeping, the best thing is to reduce the amount of leaves for the next time; as opposed to steeping them multiple times.  <sep>  Q: Steeping green tea leaves - how many times can I steep them, and do they lose flavanoids over steeps?

The onions naturally add flavour to your marinade: if you like it, leave them in, if you don't, take them out. The onions won't have any major chemical effect on the marination process.Personally I would ditch the olive oil, replace it with toasted sesame oil and add garlic and ginger for a more rounded and authentically flavoured East Asian marinade.  <sep>  Q: What's the use of onions in teriyaki sauce?

input: CONTEXT: Ok, first of all make sure you are getting French or Italian truffles, not Chinese or Oregon. Some people like the latter but they are quite a bit different. Black truffles do well cooked, while white truffles are usually only used shaved raw over a dish. When I use them, I like to use them in a situation where I will really be able to taste them. A few classic ideas are an omelette, risotto, or pasta with a cream sauce. Those all carry the flavor and aroma of truffles very well. Chop some of it very fine and put it in the dish and then slice the rest paper thin (with a mandoline if possible) over the finished food right before serving.  <sep>  Q: What should I look out for when cooking with truffles? A: first of all make sure you are getting French or Italian truffles, not Chinese or Oregon  Q: What is wrong with Chinese or Oregon truffles?

input: CONTEXT: Duck feet will render plenty of gelatin because of the amount of cartilage, same as chicken feet. Any bird's feet are a good choice.The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet. The only thing to keep in mind is that duck feet, like any other duck parts, are substantially more fatty than their chicken equivalents, so assuming you want a clear or mostly-clear stock, you'll have to spend a lot of time skimming.Alternatively you can clean the feet and other bones by boiling them in plain water for 5-10 minutes, then dumping it all out and starting over - which is what your linked recipe suggests. I don't usually do this for brown stocks because you lose a lot of flavour, but if you're starting from raw then it won't make much difference and it's an easy/lazy way to get rid of a lot of the fat at once. <sep> Q: Can I use duck feet to make duck stock A: The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet  Q: Does it add the same flavor and mouth feel?

input: CONTEXT: Yes, ceramic knives are the ""new thing,"" but that doesn't make them superior. The problem with ceramic knives is that you can never sharpen them, and, as mentioned in the comments, they may chip. Don't get a ceramic chef's knife or paring knife; the answer to your question is zero.If you really want a ceramic knife, then buy a ceramic bread knife, although you won't be getting any extra performance for the money.Ceramic blade mandolines, however, are great. The ceramic blade will be sharper and hold the edge longer than a steel mandoline, and since you don't sharpen a mandoline anyway, it doesn't matter that ceramic doesn't sharpen. Note, a separate, and good, question would be ""what knives do I need?"" The answer is it depends, but I concur that you should not buy a ""set"" of knives.  <sep>  Q: How many ceramic knives do I need?

input: CONTEXT: Preheat the pan for longer than you expect, then preheat the oil as well. Cast iron takes a long time to heat up. With some foods you can get away with not preheating so it may seem silly to just let the pan sit on the burner with nothing else happening, but the potatoes will test your patience because of how much they can stick to pans.Once you add the potatoes to the hot pan with hot oil, let them sit.

input: CONTEXT: For ramen, udon, and soba, it is not uncommon for Japanese restaurants to use multiple broths for layered flavors.My friend is from Yamagata in Japan and several of her favorite Udon places will make a sturdy broth with dashi as well as pork and chicken stocks. When I make noodles at home, I almost always start with dashi and fortify with chicken or pork stock. While the aroma of a good dashi is strong, often times it isn't solid enough to feel full-bodied.

And the same for the stuffing.Then you have to reheat them back up to a safe temperature ... the stuffing you can add extra liquid to, and make sure it gets up to the necessary temperature, but the turkey itelf is going to be difficult to reheat without drying out (maybe if it were brined it'd be better, but still less than ideal).I'd say in all, you'd save some time the day of, but the total time spent is going to be much longer, there's an increased risk of food-related illness, and there's an overall lower quality.If the main interest is in reducing cooking time, I'd start with not stuffing the bird. I'd also make sure that it's well thawed in advance (too many people leave it for the night before). If you really wanted to reduce time, you might be able to butterfly the bird, but it'd then be too wide for most ovens.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: So, just answering the new part of the question:You can simply season ""over the top"" of the existing seasoning. To do this, you'd go through the normal seasoning process, wiping the pan with oil, heating in a 500F oven, wiping again, heating again. This will fill in the ""holes"" in your seasoning and you'll be able to use the pan again.However, you will also end up with somewhat rough, uneven seasoning on the bottom. This will make things more likely to stick than if you completely reseasoned the pan. You can improve this by scrubbing the bottom of the pan with a mixture of course salt and oil. This will ""sand down"" the seasoning without completely removing it.You should also ask yourself if maybe the original seasoning of the pan wasn't faulty, given that some of it already scrubbed off.  <sep>  Q: Is there a way to re-season a cast iron pan if I scrubbed it all off?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Your metal bowl sitting in your 70Â°F room is 70Â°F (at least, if its been sitting there for a bit). Your plastic bowl, or glass bowl, or ceramic bowl, or any other bowl sitting in the same room is also 70Â°F. They're all actually the same temperature.Now, given, when you touch the metal bowl, it feels cooler than the plastic one. This is because your finger isn't 70Â°F, and your body heat is transferred away quicker by metal than (say) plastic.If the dough is room temperature, it won't matterâheat isn't flowing out of it. The dough itself doesn't generate much heat. If your dough started above room temperature, it will cool a little quicker in a metal bowl. But, if you wanted to keep it from cooling, putting it in a warm place is much more effective.A stainless steel bowl is fine. I'd avoid aluminum (and copper, if anyone makes a mixer with such a thing) due to them being reactive, especially if you're making sourdough.  <sep>  Q: Can I let my bread dough rise in the mixer bowl? A: A stainless steel bowl is fine. I'd avoid aluminum (and copper, if anyone makes a mixer with such a thing) due to them being reactive, especially if you're making sourdough.

The problem with ceramic knives is that you can never sharpen them, and, as mentioned in the comments, they may chip. Don't get a ceramic chef's knife or paring knife; the answer to your question is zero.If you really want a ceramic knife, then buy a ceramic bread knife, although you won't be getting any extra performance for the money.Ceramic blade mandolines, however, are great. The ceramic blade will be sharper and hold the edge longer than a steel mandoline, and since you don't sharpen a mandoline anyway, it doesn't matter that ceramic doesn't sharpen.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: There are several variables that need to be considered to properly and safely dry cure meat...temperature, humidity, ph level, for example. Just on the topic of moisture loss, however...you will not be able to tell simply by looking. People who do this for a living can tell by touching...most of us weigh our product before hanging. In general, when there is a 30% reduction in weight, the meat is properly cured (given that all of the other variables have been properly dealt with).Meat getting harder means it is drying, however it could be drying too fast. In this case the outside will dry before the inside has a chance to. If this is the case, the meat will not be pleasant to eat, but more importantly you could have a potential safety issue. Proper humidity and temperature will help control this....around 60 degrees F (15 C) and 60 - 70 percent humidity.As far as salt goes, be sure to use some sort of curing salt.I recommend reading up on the process. Many things can go wrong and you can make you and your guests sick very easily.  <sep>  Q: When curing meat I noticed I lose all the water in two days. Since there is no liquid does that mean I am done curing? A: There are several variables that need to be considered to properly and safely dry cure meat  Q: My meat is red and hard as the days go by. It that one of the signs? A: Meat getting harder means it is drying, however it could be drying too fast  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: How long should the cure take?

input: CONTEXT: Anything susceptible to moisture will go stale if exposed to air long enough. Storage will only get you so far, depending on the temperature and humidity in the storage area. In a restaurant kitchen, I don't have to tell you that both are rather high.I'd suggest blanching them after cutting. You could basically cook them through then store them in a relatively air-tight container for a period of several days. When a customer orders chips you'd just drop the blanched chips in the deep fryer long enough to brown and crisp them. This is what essentially every restaurant outfit that serves chips and/or french fries does and it works well. Experiment with blanching temperatures and liquids to see what works best.  <sep>  Q: I was wondering what the best way to store my homemade potato chips? A: I'd suggest blanching them after cutting.

In mine, it's 2:30 at 40 percent power and 1:30 at full power but depending on wattage, your particular times are going to vary.The trick to having an edible patty come out of the microwave is use low power to achieve the desired temp and then hit it at full power to get the outside done. It will always produce a slimy-er patty than cooking it on a stovetop or in an oven. Make sure that you cover the patty during cooking as it is going to spatter like crazy.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: A pizza stone in a normal oven will only get the maximum temperature of the oven (probably not more than 280 ÂºC / 530 ÂºF).A specific pizza oven will gett hotter (the one you linked gets 390 ÂºC / 735 ÂºF and, indeed has a stone inside).If you want to get Italian style pizzas, go for the pizza oven. They need that high temperature in order to be ready in (ideally) 90 seconds. Those Ferrari ovens are one of Italian's favourite ones, albeit they'll need a bit more time than 1.5 minutes achievable in wood fired traditional pizza ovens. You (probably) won't be able to achieve those high temperatures with a normal home kitchen oven, unless you have a pyrolytic home oven, and hack it in order to cook in it during the pyrolysis cycle.As for the waiting time between pizzas using a stone, consider it as a capacitor (or a rechargeable battery): It takes heat (until is soaked up), and then gives it back. Once you make 1 pizza (or a loaf of bread), it needs to soak (a bit) again.  <sep>  Q: Differences between the oven stone and the pizza oven? A: A pizza stone in a normal oven will only get the maximum temperature of the oven (probably not more than 280 ÂºC / 530 ÂºF  Q: I'm undecided between buying an oven stone, or a pizza oven (like http://j.mp/YXeiTr). I can't find any helpful suggestion - does anybody have any comment?

input: CONTEXT: Marshmallows expand so much because the water in them becomes steam, and gas takes up a LOT more volume than liquid. Specifically, 1 mL of water becomes ~1.36 LITERS of vapor, before it gets heated further. That's 1000-fold expansion, before you add additional expansion as the gas is heated. Marshmallows don't have all that much water content, but when it's trapped in a stretchy gelatin matrix that holds gas readily, it only takes a bit to blow the whole thing up like a balloon.You are correct that the gas expansion on its own is insufficient; unless I've badly muddled my calculations, gas expansion from 20C to ~150C (caramelization temperature) will increase the gas volume by under 50%.  <sep>  Q: Why do marshmallows poof up so huge when put in the microwave?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Chilis supply 2 things, chili flavor and heat. The flavor comes from the flesh while the heat comes from the seeds and especially the membrane that connects the seeds to the flesh. Ordinarily when someone wants to reduce the heat of a pepper I would suggest cutting it open and removing the seeds and membrane, however that's pretty much impossible with a dried pepper. My recommendation in this case would be to put the chipotles in whole, then remove them after cooking is done. Put the peppers in after all the other ingredients, just before simmering, then try to avoid stirring it if you can avoid it - be gentle so you don't burst the peppers open. Once the cooking is done you fish them out with a spoon and you can serve them as a side to the heat lovers if you like.  <sep>  Q: What effect does removing previously-dried peppers from a sauce have?

A: Once the cooking is done you fish them out with a spoon and you can serve them as a side to the heat lovers if you like  Q: How many peppers should I use? A: Chilis supply 2 things, chili flavor and heat. The flavor comes from the flesh while the heat comes from the seeds and especially the membrane that connects the seeds to the flesh  Q: can I take the seeds out of the peppers for less heat? A: Ordinarily when someone wants to reduce the heat of a pepper I would suggest cutting it open and removing the seeds and membrane, however that's pretty much impossible with a dried pepper  Q: Are there any other spices or peppers I should use? A: My recommendation in this case would be to put the chipotles in whole, then remove them after cooking is done  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: any other suggestions?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: In my experience, the most likely impact of a gentle boil vs. a furious rolling boil is going to be on texture of starchy foods, such as potatoes or other root vegetables, rather than flavor.I've found that a gentle simmer of potatoes will result in a mostly intact shape and consistent texture, whereas an aggressive boil without perfect timing can result in the outer layers of the potato breaking apart, sometimes before the center has time to cook fully.I've seen similar issues with stuffed parcels of pasta like ravioli or boiled won tons. I've also found that open pot egg poached eggs have much nicer results with a gentle simmer than an aggressive boil, perhaps for related reasons.Since part of how we experience taste is texture, you could say that the ""taste"" is affected.  <sep>  Q: Can food be boiled ""extra fast/hard"" in water?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Our brains are wired to consider food more palatable if the dedicated taste receptors (one of the six basic tastes) for salt are triggered. And in a non-urban world, salt/sodium is a valuable nutrient; the fact we might have it too readily available in the developed world doesn't change that we would DIE on a zero-sodium diet (mind that animal products like meat aren't zero-sodium, and that herbivores tend to love licking salt where they find it!). So our brains have a good evolutionary reason to like salt.Also, salt actively interferes (negatively) with another basic taste receptor - the receptor for bitterness (which can mean poison both in nature and in the developed world, or at least something we have no use for, eg an alkali). Most aromatic food (think green vegetables or spices) is bitter, and salt both attenuates that perception and balances it making the combined food still desirable for our brain. You end up with an even more palatable food since you can use an aromatic (desirable) and shut out the bitterness (not always desirable) response.Umami is a different basic taste, probably related to the presence of protein (glutamate, inosinate, guanylate... trigger it - these are amino acids or salts thereof, and an indicator of easily-digestible protein presence).  <sep>  Q: Why does salt enhance the flavor of food? A: Our brains are wired to consider food more palatable if the dedicated taste receptors (one of the six basic tastes) for salt are triggered  Q: What else does salt do?

input: CONTEXT: Being Filipino, I totally applaud you for such an excellent choice of an entree. The enemy of all fried food is moisture. Think of...potato chips. Immediately after you fry, make sure you let the food cool at room temperature before packaging. I would store the lechon in a non air-tight container, like a KFC bucket/box with parchment paper. Paper bags are good options as well. After the food has substantially cooled, feel free to refrigerate.

input: CONTEXT: Oversalting is best dealt with by serious dilution. I'd make a large, not very meaty dish from it, with lots of vegetables, cooked for a while. Fry onions and other veg, add liquid, and stir in the cooked beef. But soaking the meat should help as well. Either soak in plain water and discard the water, or soak in something you might add to the sauce (wine, beer, diluted citrus juice... ). I'd also cut it small before soaking/cooking. Most of the salt will be on the surface but you want to expose add much as possible of the meat to the liquid. Soaking should be done in the fridge, for a few hours.You could go for a tomato-based sauce, a curry using coconut milk, or a sticky orange and chilli sauce, so long as the ratio of beef to everything else (and beef to initial liquid) is small. The initial liquid shouldn't bring any more salt with it, which rules out most cmmercial stock preparations, and possbile home-made stock. These are just ideas, many beef in sauce dishes would adapt. I wouldn't add more meat, but many people would.  <sep>  Q: What can be done with accidentaly oversalted beef?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I don't think this has a single answer: The amount of alcohol would depend on the alcohol content of the soaking liquor or liqueur, soaking time, temperature of chocolate, and how thick the strawberry was. I suspect uncut strawberries would take at least several days to fully absorb alcohol and reach equilibrium, but the surface should take up alcohol fairly quickly. If they are cut up, exposing the more porous interior, I imagine an overnight soak would be sufficient to reach maximum alcohol content. The enormous, bloated mutant strawberries you sometimes see at stores could take considerably longer than others to absorb their maximum alcohol. Alcohol is much more volatile than water, so the immersion in warm, melted chocolate would remove some alcohol, but once the chocolate cools, it should trap any remaining content.The flavor of alcohol is easily masked by other flavors at under 20% content; this could explain why your friend didn't taste it, but you did. It's quite possible the strawberries packed a sobriety-busting punch, but it was disguised by the chocolate and fruit tastes.  <sep>  Q: How much alcohol remains in strawberries soaked in alcohol? A: The amount of alcohol would depend on the alcohol content of the soaking liquor or liqueur, soaking time, temperature of chocolate, and how thick the strawberry was  Q: Is the flavor a good indicator of how much alcohol is left?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Chocolate is an odd substance when it comes to melting and hardening. When chocolate hardens, its melting point will end up being just a few degrees higher than the hardening temperature.When chocolate crystallizes at high temperatures, it forms a strong, dense crystalline structure that, texture-wise, is quite brittle. Most bought chocolate (baker's chocolate and chips) is already tempered, but when you melt it, you break down that crystalline structure, and if you harden it at room temperature then it ends up forming very weak crystals that will melt in your hand.If you use a special coating chocolate (couverture or the lower-quality compound chocolate) then you don't need to worry so much about tempering (although it's still a good idea), but if you use ordinary chocolate and don't temper it then your coating will end up being messy and wet and rub off on your hands while you eat it. It might even melt while stored.Tempering is the key to making a room-temperature-stable chocolate coating. If you don't do this, you'll need to keep your pastries refrigerated until they're ready to consume.  <sep>  Q: What is the purpose of tempering chocolate? A: Tempering is the key to making a room-temperature-stable chocolate coating  Q: Can I just melt chocolate rather than tempering?

And the same for the stuffing.Then you have to reheat them back up to a safe temperature ... the stuffing you can add extra liquid to, and make sure it gets up to the necessary temperature, but the turkey itelf is going to be difficult to reheat without drying out (maybe if it were brined it'd be better, but still less than ideal).I'd say in all, you'd save some time the day of, but the total time spent is going to be much longer, there's an increased risk of food-related illness, and there's an overall lower quality.If the main interest is in reducing cooking time, I'd start with not stuffing the bird. I'd also make sure that it's well thawed in advance (too many people leave it for the night before). If you really wanted to reduce time, you might be able to butterfly the bird, but it'd then be too wide for most ovens.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: It is true, in my experience. However, if your recipe does not require salt, you should not be adding it, of course. Removing moisture from onion with the aid of salt helps it reach its desired state (brown or translucent, as desired) faster.I am most familiar with the use of onion in Indian cooking. I generally add a pinch or two of salt to onion when I start sauteing it. Onion starts sweating as soon as you add salt and start stirring. The reason that salt draws out moisture from onion is osmotic pressure. The surface of the onion acts as a semipermeable membrane barrier. Since the solution outside the onion is more concentrated with respect to salt, water moves out of the onion to the general liquid side, to balance the osmotic pressure on either side of the onion surface.  <sep>  Q: Is there any advantage to adding salt to onion while frying? A: Removing moisture from onion with the aid of salt helps it reach its desired state (brown or translucent, as desired) faster  Q: Why is removing moisture from onion important, for texture? A: helps it reach its desired state (brown or translucent, as desired) faster  Q: So, timing - Is there any advantage to adding salt to onion while frying itself rather than adding it the last? A: Onion starts sweating as soon as you add salt and start stirring  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: My friends say the salt removes moisture from onion, and that's best, although can you think of different methods for the same effect?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I have seen this happening more than once. While I don't know the whole theory behind it, each time it happened, there was something just below the hole, let's call it ""the lump"". What I think happens is that the lump is too heavy. When the batter below it tries to rise, it doesn't have the strength to push up the lump. This could be combined with differences in heat transfer throughout the batter vs. on the batter-lump transition in preventing rising (I am certain they exist, but I don't know whether they have an effect at all). The result is a hole where the batter didn't rise, surrounded by nicely risen batter. As to where the lump comes from: you say ""chocolate and pear cake"". If you have pear pieces in the batter, right under the surface, they can do this. I have certainly seen it happen when the recipe includes fruit pieces in the batter. If there are no pear pieces, my second guess is badly dissolved flour. The directions for this type of cake normally include folding the whites very gently, and generally erring on the side of too little whisking. This could contribute to uneven batter texture, resulting in lumps. In the second case, the cake may have some less-than-pleasant pieces, but will still be mostly good. If it is fruit, the holes are purely a cosmetic problem. So not much harm done either way, unless you are shooting for a prize at a baking competition.  <sep>  Q: I baked a chocolate and pear cake whose batter is made with yolks, sugar, butter, melted chocolate and amaretti, flour and baking powder and whisked whites. It was (not very evenly) divided in two layers, sandwiching a layer of pear pieces pre-cooked in rum.### My question is: what are the holes due to? A: I have seen this happening more than once. While I don't know the whole theory behind it, each time it happened, there was something just below the hole, let's call it ""the lump  Q: Uneven division of batter? A: What I think happens is that the lump is too heavy. When the batter below it tries to rise, it doesn't have the strength to push up the lump  Q: How can this be prevented A: folding the whites very gently, and generally erring on the side of too little whisking  Q: Any other suggestions? A: there are no pear pieces, my second guess is badly dissolved flour  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Could using a better source of flour work?

input: CONTEXT: For ramen, udon, and soba, it is not uncommon for Japanese restaurants to use multiple broths for layered flavors.My friend is from Yamagata in Japan and several of her favorite Udon places will make a sturdy broth with dashi as well as pork and chicken stocks. When I make noodles at home, I almost always start with dashi and fortify with chicken or pork stock. While the aroma of a good dashi is strong, often times it isn't solid enough to feel full-bodied. Try adding other stocks/broths and see where that gets you. Use neckbones and feet if you make your own pork stock.  <sep>  Q: I had delicious Udon soup at a Japanese restaurant, and my attempts to recreate have failed. what am I missing?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The key difference from my perspective is cleaning. Silicone is the easiest material in my kitchen to scrub clean, with the possible exception of stainless steel. Cloth is very far down the list.Also, depending on the texture of the cloth, more food will almost certainly stick to the cloth, unless it's sealed with something, in which case what is it sealed with? And how is it sealing the fiberglass in?I use the kind with a thin grid of fibers inside the silicone. It adds more stability and lets the overall thickness be thinner for better heat transmission, compared to a plain silicone silpat. As long as I don't use it as a cutting board, the fiberglass stays safely inside. It does add a very slight grid texture to the bottom of loaves, but it's barely noticeable and doesn't look bad at all.The pyramid kind, which would reduce food contact and increase drainage and airflow, sounds like it would be good for specific applications, but not something I'd make a batch of cookies on.  <sep>  Q: What are the differences between cloth, fiberglass and silicone baking mats?

input: CONTEXT: There are good quality vegan margarines (Earth balance, Alsan) on the market nowadays, often they are of the interesterified instead of the hydrogenated variety. They are designed to behave and taste similar to butter instead of (as many cheap margarines seem to do) staying spreadable at temperatures where butter would be very firm. Unlike pure coconut or palm oil, they do not act very brittle when cold, and also they soften gradually instead of suddenly melting like eutectic solder.

input: CONTEXT: I'm sorry to say this, but I think prevention is the best answer. Once you're vegetables freeze things happen at the cellular level that changes the nature of the vegetables. For example, ice crystals pierce cell walls which destroys some of the structure, which is responsible for the crispness and crunch of the vegetable. I don't think there is really a way to ""fix"" this, once it happens.That said, cooking does something similar to vegetables. Cooking destroys cell walls, which is why cooked carrots are so much softer than raw carrots. I would think that vegetables that stand up to cooking would survive freezing the best (such as your mushrooms). On the other hand, somthing like lettuce is a lost cause, once frozen.  <sep>  Q: Can you help me with recovering frozen vegetables from my crisper?

input: CONTEXT: Actually I would disagree to some extent with the other two answers - I think you can use creme fraiche instead. I agree with MStodd that it will certainly give a different flavour and texture to the sauce, but if you're just looking for a healthier base to a pasta sauce, I'd say it's fine to substitute. Also as daniel mentions, you have to be careful not to overheat it (although the same is true of cream), as it will curdle.In my experience, creme fraiche is great to make a very quick and easy pasta sauce. Put it in right at the end of cooking, once everything else is properly cooked and just heat enough so it is warmed through.It comes down to whether you are wanting to achieve the same flavours though - if you are, maybe you could try what I would call single cream (not sure what it would be called in the US), and thicken the sauce with a bit of cornflour mixed with cold water.  <sep>  Q: Can Creme Fraiche be substituted for Heavy Cream in a Cream Sauce?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Firstly - shop-bought ""packet"" bread will keep for several days because it contains a lot of preservatives.In his excellent book Bread Matters, Andrew Whitley claims that home-made sourdough breads with very long rises have better keeping properties than home-made bread made with baker's yeast and short rises. This, he claims, is because the sourdough yeast cultivates a culture of friendly bacteria and an acid environment, all of which become natural preservatives. My experience seems to confirm this.Bread recipes containing egg, oil or milk tend to keep for longer than those without.As @SAJ14SAJ says, bread freezes very well. Loss of flavour in the freezer is not a commonly recognised phenomenon.One option is to slice a loaf of bread, bag it and freeze it. Take as many slices as you need at a time. It will defrost very quickly at room temperature, due to its low mass and high surface area.Another option is to make rolls, part-bake, and freeze. When you need them, take as many rolls as you need from the freezer, and place in the oven, to both defrost and complete the baking. You will get fresh baking smells and flavours from this.I suspect that home-made unleavened breads (pita, chapati, tortilla), without added preservatives, will not last long out of the freezer. Their advantage is that with no rise, they are so quick to make that they can be made fresh on-demand.  <sep>  Q: What kind of homemade sandwich bread or wrap lasts longest?

As the chicken is already cooked it looks like all you're doing is cooking the pastry so you could just use thinner pastry which would cook quicker, or better you could use layers of phyllo pasty which would cook a lot quicker but of course wouldn't puff up like the puff pastry.If you follow this it could probably bake for just 25 minutes or there about.Hope this helps!  <sep>  Q: Can I par-bake this pot pie recipe?

It looks to be the built up bits of grease and other residues from the bottom of your cooking pans that have accumulated over the 5 years. Not saying you slopped lots but the smallest amounts of spatter from cooking will add up. I moved 6 months ago into a place with a new stove and I've done my best not to spill food and to always wipe up right away but I've noticed the burners getting marked. It doesn't wash off either. Do you find the elements you cook on the most are more marked?But to answer your original question whether the scratches affect the burners' performance, the answer is no.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: With online meat shopping in the UK you have to go with the reputation of the source, there's no grading system which you can refer to. Top end butchers and grocery stores carry top end beef, and most of the time you do get what you pay for. Many supermarket chains have premium labels, ie Tesco Finest and Sainsbury's Taste The Difference, which are definitely much better than their regular stuff, but I think the best mainstream grocery store premium brand for meat is Coop. At the end of the day there's no substitute for getting your own eyes on the meat you are buying, so I would recommend you try local butcher shops. There's still plenty of them around in the UK, and the quality varies dramatically. There are some that will pawn off legs of lamb that are about to turn, and others which control their entire supply chain and have some of the best meat in the world. You just have to try a few and see.  <sep>  Q: As a consumer in the UK, how can I choose well marbled beef?

input: CONTEXT: I'm not a professional fudger, but here is my theory: one should add it to the boiling mixture. The reason is that butter has milk solids that are said to âburnâ at low temperatures (somewhere in the range 120C-150C or 250F-300F) which just above the soft ball stage (113C or 235F) needed for making fudge. I interpret the burning to mean that those milk solids (sugars and proteins) get a chance to contribute to the Maillard reaction that gives caramel (and its grained cousin the fudge) its great and rich flavor. Given how unique and varied the flavors arising from butter are, I would not want to miss their contribution by adding them after the heat is gone.  <sep>  Q: How is butter used in fudge? A: one should add it to the boiling mixture  Q: My main question here is Why do some recipes put the butter ON the fudge once its hot whereas the professional videos (i.e. youtube mackinac fudge shops) seem to show the butter in the boiling mix?

input: CONTEXT: Wooden blocks are ideal for knife storage because they keep the blades dry (the wood absorbs some of the humidity in the air), preventing rusting. The motion of inserting and withdrawing blades over wood will not noticeably dull them, because you're not actually cutting the wood or indeed even applying any pressure as you do so.A good tip is to use a good quality steel to sharpen your knives with just one or two passes on each side before each use.

input: CONTEXT: First off, the ISO standard is not intended to produce a good cup of tea. It is designed to produce a consistent one for taste testing, so that no tea manufacturer can claim that his tea wasn't made ""properly"".It's title is ""Tea -- Preparation of liquor for use in sensory tests""As for the actual tea making, yes, leaving the bag in longer will make a stronger cup of tea. The concentration of caffeine (along with flavour molecules and everything else) will slowly trend towards an equal concentration in the leaf and in the water. The longer you leave the tea bag/leaves in the water, the closer to equilibrium you will get.There are other factors that affect this, such as the temperature of the water, cut of the leaves, bag versus loose leaf and so on, but the trend is always towards equilibrium as time progresses.I'm not sure where the upper limit of this lies, but I think that once the cup is cold there's no point in it anyway. Thus, leaving the bag in for an hour is a bit much. I usually steep my tea for 3-6 minutes, depending on how strong I want it to be.  <sep>  Q: Does brewing tea for longer result in higher caffeine content?

input: CONTEXT: There's not really anything easy you can do. Even adding lemon zest or essence isn't really going to help; it'll just give you a lemony but still sweet cake. I suppose theoretically you could add sour things, since that does tend to balance out sweetness, but it's tricky since acid will interact with the leavening. A sour icing, or a sour sauce to serve it with, might be a better bet in that vein.So unfortunately, you'd be best off shopping around for cake mixes that are more the level of sweetness you want. You might be able to use the nutrition facts to help get a sense of how sweet they are before you buy them.  <sep>  Q: How can I make cake mix less sweet?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: It is true, in my experience. However, if your recipe does not require salt, you should not be adding it, of course. Removing moisture from onion with the aid of salt helps it reach its desired state (brown or translucent, as desired) faster.I am most familiar with the use of onion in Indian cooking. I generally add a pinch or two of salt to onion when I start sauteing it. Onion starts sweating as soon as you add salt and start stirring. The reason that salt draws out moisture from onion is osmotic pressure. The surface of the onion acts as a semipermeable membrane barrier. Since the solution outside the onion is more concentrated with respect to salt, water moves out of the onion to the general liquid side, to balance the osmotic pressure on either side of the onion surface.  <sep>  Q: Is there any advantage to adding salt to onion while frying? A: Removing moisture from onion with the aid of salt helps it reach its desired state (brown or translucent, as desired) faster  Q: What is the right about of salt to add?

But that will only help if the problem is the bread getting hard too soon. That can also be prevented by keeping it in a plastic bag. You'll get the mold before the bread goes stale.If you're keeping the bread in a plastic bag, try paper bags.To solve the mold problem, the traditional way is to add some acidity. For example, you can add a sourdough starter. If you don't like the taste of sourdough, a poolish starter should also help. The bacteria it grows will prevent the mold growing.I know it's not what you're asking, but freezing will also help.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Fat doesn't spoil like other foods. No bacteria can live in fat. Going rancid is a chemical reaction in which the fat molecules break down. So ""leaving out"" is not a problem. The major factors in going rancid are light and air. The more light hits your fat, the sooner it goes rancid. Also, rancidity occurs when the fat is oxidized, meaning that if you prevent contact with air, your fat will last longer. Both factors are minimized by transferring the fat to a tightly closed opaque container. With liquid oils, you use a dark colored bottle. As bottles are impractical for solid fat, just strain your grease into a jar, close it, and put it in a cupboard. The shelf life should be many months, probably more than a year. Also, don't worry that you can get something nasty when the grease goes bad unnoticed. Rancid fat isn't a big safety risk, and ingesting it in small amounts is not problematic. If it stinks, throw it out. Before that, there is no problem eating it. The above assumes pure, well-strained fat. Pieces of fried meat left over in the fat are a safety risk, even tiny ones.  <sep>  Q: How long does grease take to go bad/rancid when sitting out? A: The more light hits your fat, the sooner it goes rancid  Q: If I make a skillet full of bacon, how long can I leave the grease sitting out before it is unsafe/rancid? A: if you prevent contact with air, your fat will last longer  Q: How long do you think that it's still safe to use? A: If it stinks, throw it out. Before that, there is no problem eating it  Q: Should I store it in the refrigerator or leave it out? A: just strain your grease into a jar, close it, and put it in a cupboard  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Is the answer different for ground beef grease?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The easy way: Use raspberry oil (preferably) or a raspberry extract in place of the peppermint oil.The (probably) much better way: Leave out the oil and food coloring and use raspberry puree as you suggested. Strain frozen or fresh raspberries through a fine strainer or cheese cloth. Weigh the resulting juice/puree and then put it on the stove an cook it until the puree is half of its original weight (roughly). This reduced puree will be more intensely raspberry, so it will get all of the raspberry flavor without having to add as much water to the recipe. You'll have to experiment with the amount of reduced raspberry puree to use.I wouldn't increase the corn syrup, but you certainly could if you want them sweeter. I would personally go for the opposite effect and add a small amount of lemon juice to the raspberry puree to give a little tartness to complement the sweetness of the marshmallow.As far as the chocolate, I would recommend a darker chocolate. 55% is quite sweet, especially around a marshmallow. You should also consider the type of chocolate. Cocoa percentage isn't everything in dark chocolate. Experiment with different types of chocolate and see what fits well with the marshmallows. Just like wine, chocolate should be paired with other foods according to the subtleties of the taste of the individual chocolate.  <sep>  Q: Converting Peppermint Marshmallow Recipe to Raspberry? A: The easy way: Use raspberry oil (preferably) or a raspberry extract in place of the peppermint oil  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Where can I find raspberry oil?

Poking the dough will not harm the dough in any way, so don't be afraid to poke the dough. The best way to test if the bread dough has risen enough is by poking it. As for the oven, if the temperature is too low, it can take longer to get additional rise in the oven. What I do, as do many other bread bakers, is to bake the bread at the hottest temperature it can reach for the first ten minutes, then turn it down to the regular temperature for the remainder of the time needed to bake the bread.

input: CONTEXT: No, bartenders do not shake carbonated beverages. I was a bartender for years and I have never known this to happen or be part of a recipe. The carbonated sodas are always put on the top of the glass after pouring. The foam comes from the sugar or egg whites in the sweet n sour mix. You can find that recipe on line. Here is one that is overly complicated, bars rarely (never to my knowledge) use fresh lemon or lime juice. However a good bar uses separate lemon & lime mix for different drinks, or they used to anyway. I personally use limeade or lemonade at home. You can use one of the other or mix them together. Throw that in a shaker & you will get some foam, it works in my blender.  <sep>  Q: I love mixing drinks in cocktail shakers but wonder if I use carbonated drinks in this is a good idea?

input: CONTEXT: We have a convection oven and almost always use it. I can't remember the last time we didn't use convection.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Chocolate is an odd substance when it comes to melting and hardening. When chocolate hardens, its melting point will end up being just a few degrees higher than the hardening temperature.When chocolate crystallizes at high temperatures, it forms a strong, dense crystalline structure that, texture-wise, is quite brittle. Most bought chocolate (baker's chocolate and chips) is already tempered, but when you melt it, you break down that crystalline structure, and if you harden it at room temperature then it ends up forming very weak crystals that will melt in your hand.If you use a special coating chocolate (couverture or the lower-quality compound chocolate) then you don't need to worry so much about tempering (although it's still a good idea), but if you use ordinary chocolate and don't temper it then your coating will end up being messy and wet and rub off on your hands while you eat it. It might even melt while stored.Tempering is the key to making a room-temperature-stable chocolate coating. If you don't do this, you'll need to keep your pastries refrigerated until they're ready to consume.  <sep>  Q: What is the purpose of tempering chocolate?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Marshmallows expand so much because the water in them becomes steam, and gas takes up a LOT more volume than liquid. Specifically, 1 mL of water becomes ~1.36 LITERS of vapor, before it gets heated further. That's 1000-fold expansion, before you add additional expansion as the gas is heated. Marshmallows don't have all that much water content, but when it's trapped in a stretchy gelatin matrix that holds gas readily, it only takes a bit to blow the whole thing up like a balloon.You are correct that the gas expansion on its own is insufficient; unless I've badly muddled my calculations, gas expansion from 20C to ~150C (caramelization temperature) will increase the gas volume by under 50%.  <sep>  Q: Why do marshmallow get so puffed up in the microwave?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Chocolate is an odd substance when it comes to melting and hardening. When chocolate hardens, its melting point will end up being just a few degrees higher than the hardening temperature.When chocolate crystallizes at high temperatures, it forms a strong, dense crystalline structure that, texture-wise, is quite brittle. Most bought chocolate (baker's chocolate and chips) is already tempered, but when you melt it, you break down that crystalline structure, and if you harden it at room temperature then it ends up forming very weak crystals that will melt in your hand.If you use a special coating chocolate (couverture or the lower-quality compound chocolate) then you don't need to worry so much about tempering (although it's still a good idea), but if you use ordinary chocolate and don't temper it then your coating will end up being messy and wet and rub off on your hands while you eat it. It might even melt while stored.Tempering is the key to making a room-temperature-stable chocolate coating. If you don't do this, you'll need to keep your pastries refrigerated until they're ready to consume.  <sep>  Q: What is the purpose of tempering chocolate? A: Tempering is the key to making a room-temperature-stable chocolate coating  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: If I'm dipping something in chocolate, can I get by with just melting the chocolate?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Lime juice isn't going to make it less spicy, if anything I've found it accentuates the spiciness a bit although I'm not sure of the mechanism. It could be that the acidity frees up more capsaicin compounds (what makes hot food hot), or wakes up your taste buds more. Most likely you have simply added a weak jalapeno. Peppers of the same variety can vary in heat strength quite a bit depending on the where and how it was grown, although you'll get weak and strong peppers from the same plant. You can make up for the lack of spice by adding more jalapeno or a bit of hot chili powder.  <sep>  Q: Does lime juice make jalapeÃ±os less spicy?

input: CONTEXT: You can wait as long as you need to between pre-cook (that's the simmering) and finish (the steaming), it's how things work in restaurants.The steaming time will only go up if you let the temperature drop appreciably. Even so, you shouldn't need more than an extra minute or so. Steaming is pretty benign to rice.As far as the safety concerns...if you keep the temperature above 135 F, you are out of the danger zone, and you can hold there forever. The danger zone is 41 to 135 F, but the goal in cooling foods is to get it from hot to cool in 6 hours...below 70 in two, and then 4 hours to make it below 41 (yes, I'm ServSafe certified). So your hypothetical 30-45 minutes shouldn't cause you a problem. But watch it if you start going long.  <sep>  Q: How long can I hold brown rice between boiling and steaming?###I use a technique from Cooks Illustrated for cooking my brown rice.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: @Rumtscho has some good points, especially around using non-non-stick pans. A cast iron frying pan would work better for that. However, if you don't have one my suggestion for pan-frying something like breaded fish would be to pull the fish through the oil puddle with your fingers or tongs as you put it in and then let the fish sit on the non-oily part of the pan. Repeat that for all the pieces. I think what you'll find doing that though is that the breading will soak up all the oil, and you'll need to add some more in anyway in order to have enough to coat the other side when you turn the fish over. Adding more oil will cool the pan and you won't get as good as a result, so it's counter-productive. You're better off adding more oil at the beginning. If you are worried about health, don't fry in oil!  <sep>  Q: What is the best oil for evenly distributing oils (butter, chicken or bacon fat, and other oils) around a non-stick pan###or best way sorry.

input: CONTEXT: Thanks for adding the photo, Ford, as I think I know what it is. Although your photo is nicely focused, it's not the real thing so I can't be 100% sure. It looks to be the built up bits of grease and other residues from the bottom of your cooking pans that have accumulated over the 5 years. Not saying you slopped lots but the smallest amounts of spatter from cooking will add up. I moved 6 months ago into a place with a new stove and I've done my best not to spill food and to always wipe up right away but I've noticed the burners getting marked. It doesn't wash off either. Do you find the elements you cook on the most are more marked?But to answer your original question whether the scratches affect the burners' performance, the answer is no. All they need to be able to do is heat up and even a knick in the metal wouldn't stop it from heating.  <sep>  Q: Do scratches on electric range burner elements affect its performance or function? A: the answer is no  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Is it possible to replace the heating elements and keep the stove?

input: CONTEXT: Propane and butane are pure alkanes. They don't produce anything nasty when burned. The worst you could possibly get should be carbon monoxide (and I am not even sure it can be produced in a torch, the dioxide ifs much more likely), but it being a gas, it won't stick to your food. The complex molecules you get from heating the food itself have more potential for being harmful than the combustion products of a propane butane torch. Ago yes, it is food safe. Another matter of safety is that it is easier to cause a fire with a hardware store torch, because it has more power than the kitchen ones. But a sensible adult should be able to handle the thing safely.  <sep>  Q: Is it safe to use a propane torch bought at a Hardware store? A: Propane and butane are pure alkanes.

input: CONTEXT: This isn't the ""quick"" nor the healthy answer, but I personally do a twice-cooked system. I leave the juice from the can in the mix, and boil it down, which takes 15 minutes or so. Retaining the flavor of the canned fluid is essential, in my opinion.Then I ""fry"" the dry-ish mixture which is beginning to separate in maybe 1 tbsp preheated lard per can of beans, stirring a lot at first. Lastly, very slightly simmer this on low heat for 1 hour or so, stirring occasionally. Flavor is awesome. Any kinds of beans can be prepared in this way, and it is similar (varying on oil and legume variety) to other paste concoctions created elsewhere.. such as in the middle east.Note that this method negates the need for lots of ""mashing"". So, if you're more looking for less effort, than necessarily for ""quick"".. this could be your answer :)  <sep>  Q: Is there any special way to liquidize the skins of the beans?

input: CONTEXT: @Rumtscho has some good points, especially around using non-non-stick pans. A cast iron frying pan would work better for that. However, if you don't have one my suggestion for pan-frying something like breaded fish would be to pull the fish through the oil puddle with your fingers or tongs as you put it in and then let the fish sit on the non-oily part of the pan. Repeat that for all the pieces. I think what you'll find doing that though is that the breading will soak up all the oil, and you'll need to add some more in anyway in order to have enough to coat the other side when you turn the fish over. Adding more oil will cool the pan and you won't get as good as a result, so it's counter-productive. You're better off adding more oil at the beginning. If you are worried about health, don't fry in oil!  <sep>  Q: Distributing small amounts of oil around a non-stick pan

input: CONTEXT: The recipe calls for ground almonds. This can be done in a food processor. You may wish to remove the almonds' skins beforehand, and you also may wish to toast them. Both of those are very common, even though neither is essential. With this particular recipe, I'd be inclined to toast them but leave the skins on. Once you've made those decisions, measure out the sugar called for in the recipe. Set it aside. Then place the almonds in the processor and add two or three heaping tablespoons of the measured sugar. Pulse until you reach a grind that resembles a meal, or very course flour. The finer you grind the almonds, the more carefully you must watch them. Eventually, the almonds will begin to turn to a paste. The sugar is helping to prevent it, and that's helping you to get a finer grind. However, overprocess and the almonds will turn to paste. If you're carefully watching for it, though, you'll see it begin to happen before it goes too far.  <sep>  Q: How do I grind almonds for making marzipan?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: You cooked it at too low a temperature. Sous vide is intended for meat where you want the protein to remain tender. It shouldn't have any sinews. Think chicken breasts, or the long filet along the spine of a pig. This meat gets nicely cooked at 60-65Â°C (depends on the animal), and tough and dry above that. Meat marbled with sinews has to be cooked at a temperature where the sinews (collagen) melt into gelatin. This happens at about 70Â°C at least, and takes hours. Since the muscle fibres are already toughened at that temperature, there is no reason to hold it low; you can put it at full boil in a normal pot and cook it there, you just have to wait long enough. In theory, you could do it in a sous vide bath too, but you won't get any of the benefits sous vide gives to tender meat.  <sep>  Q: I tried cooking sous vide chicken and it came out tough and stringy, can you tell me why?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Mast O Khiar, as you mention mainly consist of plain yogurt and cucumbers and most recipe do not require much more than that. Because of such, the shelf life for the yogurt product will be the shelf life of the yogurt itself. If it is a store bought yogurt, then the shelf life should be about 2 weeks in the refrigerator.Make sure to store the sauce in an air-tight container. Most tubberware should work. Those soup containers from Chinese takeout orders work perfectly.EDIT: After a bit of a debate in cooking chat, I decided to change my answer a little. The reason I said 2 week is because personally I had eaten 2 week old Mast O Khiar. However it could be recipe dependant so it could be different for a different recipe. However it is very easy to tell whether yogurt OR cucumber is bad.Mast O Khiar should have a very fresh/clean aroma. When yogurt turn bad, it releases a rancid smell. If it smells bad, dont eat it.If you see fuzzy mold it's a good idea to throw it out.  <sep>  Q: What is the Shelf life of a yogurt product? A: If it is a store bought yogurt, then the shelf life should be about 2 weeks in the refrigerator  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Do you have any advice about storing cucumbers in yogurt?

input: CONTEXT: Duck feet will render plenty of gelatin because of the amount of cartilage, same as chicken feet. Any bird's feet are a good choice.The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet. The only thing to keep in mind is that duck feet, like any other duck parts, are substantially more fatty than their chicken equivalents, so assuming you want a clear or mostly-clear stock, you'll have to spend a lot of time skimming.Alternatively you can clean the feet and other bones by boiling them in plain water for 5-10 minutes, then dumping it all out and starting over - which is what your linked recipe suggests. I don't usually do this for brown stocks because you lose a lot of flavour, but if you're starting from raw then it won't make much difference and it's an easy/lazy way to get rid of a lot of the fat at once. <sep> Q: Can I use duck feet to make duck stock A: The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet  Q: Does it add the same flavor and mouth feel?

input: CONTEXT: Are you just using eggs for your filling? Most quiche fillings are a custard, with milk, cream, or other dairy as well as eggs, and often cheese as well. It sounds like you are over beating your egg or custard mixture, and inadvertently incorporating air.In general you want minimum air in a quiche filling, so whisk or stir it briefly until it comes together, but not extra.Its harder to tell from the description, but you may also be over baking the quiche. You want to cook it until the center just barely jiggles, about 180 F / 82 C.  <sep>  Q: Why is my quiche always coming out rubbery? A: It sounds like you are over beating your egg or custard mixture, and inadvertently incorporating air  Q: I have been whisking them before hand, should I not be doing that? A: In general you want minimum air in a quiche filling, so whisk or stir it briefly until it comes together, but not extra  Q: Ok thank you.###Are there any fillings that would cause this problem? A: Are you just using eggs for your filling? Most quiche fillings are a custard, with milk, cream, or other dairy as well as eggs, and often cheese as well  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: I have just been using bacon, peppers, and mushrooms. What sort of cheese should I use?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I may be wrong but I'll give it a shot.When you heat chicken (or any other muscle for that matter) it tenses up. As it tenses up it is essentially squeezing juices out, because all the fibres are closer together. Just think what happens when you slice a rare steak without letting it rest, there will be blood everywhere. In general I believe boiling anything is bad practice. A slow simmer maximum is required to retain all the desired qualities. Hence the saying ""low and slow"" which I take quite literally band apply to just about everything culinary wise. From cooking stew to proving bread, the longer the better. Edit:I wrote that then went in the shower and remembered pasta & potatoes, so maybe low and slow unless it's a starchy carbohydrate. Or if you are searing, but often a blazing hot seat is accompanied by a nice rest.  <sep>  Q: Why does my chicken go dry when I boil it?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Yes, you can roast the beans some more. However the results will probably not be great. Roasting results in quite a bit of smoke. If you are going low tech, I would do it in a wok in a very well ventilated area. It's pretty easy to set off smoke detectors. A stove top with a range hood might be good enough if you have a particularly good range hood. Outside with the wok on a BBQ is probably best.Roast over a low heat and stir continuously. You want to get the beans as even as possible, trying not to burn them. The beans will continue to roast after taking them off the heat. So stop one or two roast levels before the desired colour and tip your beans out into a colander and continue stirring to cool. The residual heat will cook the bean some more. To aim for a desired roast level, compare the current roast colour to your desired roast colour and maybe to a roast level chart. Google image search ""coffee roast level chart"". Guesstimate the roast level that is one or two levels below your desired colour to stop at.Once again there will be a lot of smoke.  <sep>  Q: How to improve the taste of sour coffee beans?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: With Olive oils, the more refined they are, the higher their burning point. So you are correct, an Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil would be a terrible choice for Indian cooking (would cause effect on taste, smell, and nutrition) which has prolonged periods of sauteing on high heat. Lower quality olive oils, or a light olive oil, interestingly, would be a better choice. They are much more refined like vegetable oils, so have a higher burning point. But at that point, you'd consider why are you using Olive oil?Consider using refined butter (ghee) or coconut oil for Indian cooking. Ghee and Coconut oil will rarely smoke or burn and can stand high heat pretty well. I believe traditional Indian cooking uses ghee.  <sep>  Q: What oils are suitable for Indian cooking (i.e. extended frying duration)? A: Lower quality olive oils, or a light olive oil, interestingly, would be a better choice  Q: The oil is on the stove for a long time, I have extra virgin olive oil, will that do?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Gelatin sheets are soaked in cold-to-room-temp water in order to soften and rehydrate them slightly before stirring them into the (often hot) food. If you were to try to stir a sheet of gelatin directly into hot liquid, you'd find that it behaves a lot like cornstarch. It clumps up immediately and produces unpleasant-to-eat chunks that only a blender and a chinois have a hope of removing.You squeeze it after soaking to remove excess (unflavored) water from the exterior. Otherwise, each sheet might bring along quite a bit of water, which will seriously affect the consistency of a product you expect to set up, and might affect the taste of even something like a braise to which you are adding the gelatin just for body.  <sep>  Q: Why do we soak and squeeze gelatine?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The professional (read: industrial) solution would be maltodextrin powder. It is rather tasteless, has good solubility in liquids, and doesn't change much texturewise. In homemade spice mixes, the popular filler solution are dried breadcrumbs of a very small size (like breadcrumbs for schnitzel breading). They are noticeable, because the mix gets gritty, but the consensus among those who do it is that this is a feature, not a bug. They could also slightly thicken a wet dish (soup, stew), but present no problem when strewn over dry food. You can also use a nut flour made of nuts without much of an own taste, like apricot kernels or low quality overdried almonds. Again, this will be somewhat gritty, but not as hard as the breadcrumn solution.  <sep>  Q: Hello, I am trying to find an extender/filter for my spice mix. Any recommendations? A: The professional (read: industrial) solution would be maltodextrin powder. It is rather tasteless, has good solubility in liquids, and doesn't change much texturewise  Q: It does not change the texture much but will it change any other properties of the mix?

input: CONTEXT: I'm not sure I've ever seen chipotle paste called for in recipes; I searched around a bit and what I found was consistent with my experience. I saw chipotle en adobo, ground chipotle, and even whole dried chipotle. I also easily found recipes for chipotle en adobo. I don't think you'll have any trouble figuring out what to do with them.The most common way I've seen chipotles, both in grocery stores and in recipes, is chipotle en adobo. You can make your own by simmering dried chipotles in tomato paste with vinegar, garlic, onion (search for recipes if that's not specific enough). I suspect that most chipotle pastes you might find are something like this, but pureed, and possibly cooked until thicker.The other common way to use chipotles is as a powder; that's as easy as grinding them in a spice grinder. If you're using them in something that gets cooked for a decent amount of time, I'd just do this and add them, instead of making chipotle en adobo or a paste out of them.

input: CONTEXT: The old thin utensils were made of Nylon.The reasons they are hard to find is that traditional Nylon is difficult to manufacture within food standard guidelines for PAA (Primary Aromatic Amines) migration, and does not bio-degrade or burn safely. For relevant references, your local government health department will have papers on PAA migration.Given that, many utensil manufactures have moved on to other plastics, mostly silicone. Though some use PA66 (Nylon 6,6), which is that thick chunky black plastic stuff.Try wooden spatulas. They are simple, clean, disposable, and you can get them in thin wedge shapes (e.g. at Asian supply shops).  <sep>  Q: Where did the thin, smooth plastic spatulas go?###20 years ago, the most common type of rigid spatula (or ""turner"") was smooth, thin (as in 3mm or less with a sharp edge), and generally made of nylon.### These spatulas were not very durable (leading edges tended to melt), but they were very very good for making eggs and other delicate non-stick-pan dishes. A: they are hard to find is that traditional Nylon is difficult to manufacture within food standard guidelines for PAA (Primary Aromatic Amines) migration, and does not bio-degrade or burn safely  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Why did manufacturers stop making thin, smooth plastic turner spatulas?

input: CONTEXT: There are good quality vegan margarines (Earth balance, Alsan) on the market nowadays, often they are of the interesterified instead of the hydrogenated variety. They are designed to behave and taste similar to butter instead of (as many cheap margarines seem to do) staying spreadable at temperatures where butter would be very firm. Unlike pure coconut or palm oil, they do not act very brittle when cold, and also they soften gradually instead of suddenly melting like eutectic solder. These should be on the top of the list of things to try...Also, some recipes recommend using more than one type of fat in pastry, for more interesting texture (eg such margarine, and smaller flakes of a hardened coconut fat).  <sep>  Q: Are there any butter alternatives for baking pastry?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: From a cooking perspective any imitation sauce or marinade is never going to deliver the quality that venison has to deliver. We have a massive deer farm close and the price is still ridiculous .My suggestion is that you find a good butcher that will age beef for you on the bone ,or you could age it yourself if you have a climate control area to keep it at the correct temperature. Anything over 30 days on the bone will start to give you the gaming flavour you are craving.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The great benefit of brining is that it opens the fibers of the meat and allows the water, and what is dissolved in the water, into the meat. I suggest you convince yourself of this by adding a fragrant herb such as rosemary to a chicken breast brine, and comparing it side-by-side with an unbrined breast. The difference, deep into the meat, will be noticeable. It is not large chunks of the herbs that find their way into the meat, but the oils and dissolved parts.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Grana padano and pecorino romano are two other very savory, hard grating cheeses that work well on pasta. They taste a bit different than Parmigiano-Reggiano, but are quite good in their own right and often less expensive. You can also look at parmesan type cheeses that are not actually Parmigiano-Reggiano. For example, Whole Foods often has one from Argentina that offers a reasonable price/performance tradeoff. All of that said, in many people's opinion, nothing is really quite as delicious as true Parmigiano-Reggiano.  <sep>  Q: Is there a Cheaper alternative to parmesan cheese?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: In the fridge, an hour should not be a problem, but could still end up bitter depending on the kind of onion used. Usually, Marinades, Pestos etc. that use mashed onions and/or garlic taste best if they are made the way the name ""Pesto"" suggests: Cutting stuff very fine, then using a mortar and pestle. Most explanations WHY that is the case have to with the fact that blenders tend to disintegrate cell walls with relatively rough cuts of a fast but half-sharp or blunt blade, releasing more enzymes etc. from the cell walls as opposed to from the cell contents. These are plausible, since some of the compounds in different parts of onion cells are known to actively react when the onion is disintegrated.Also, try adding oil (which you often want in a marinade anyway. No unrefined olive oil in a blender, though - that is known to get bitter!) while mortaring or blending - this will help extract flavor compounds and probably provide some oxidation protection.There is a well known marinade working with onions, garlic etc: Bulgogi marinade.  <sep>  Q: How long can blended onions stay relatively fresh?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: It is true, in my experience. However, if your recipe does not require salt, you should not be adding it, of course. Removing moisture from onion with the aid of salt helps it reach its desired state (brown or translucent, as desired) faster.I am most familiar with the use of onion in Indian cooking. I generally add a pinch or two of salt to onion when I start sauteing it. Onion starts sweating as soon as you add salt and start stirring. The reason that salt draws out moisture from onion is osmotic pressure. The surface of the onion acts as a semipermeable membrane barrier. Since the solution outside the onion is more concentrated with respect to salt, water moves out of the onion to the general liquid side, to balance the osmotic pressure on either side of the onion surface.  <sep>  Q: Is there any advantage to adding salt to onion while frying?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: There's no right or wrong answer as there are advantages to both and it's about what you want out of a burger. The advantage of the minimal disturbance method is that the strands of the meat give the burger structural strength. It also gives a pure beef flavor as you aren't adding anything to it. The mix up method breaks up the strands of meat which come out of the grinder which makes patties more fragile, however flavorings are distributed evenly. Some people add binding agents like egg and breadcrumbs to hold it together when using the mix up method in which case it becomes more of a flat meatball than a burger. My personal preference is the minimal disturbance method as it is fast, the patties hold together, and I like the flavor of pure beef. After forming the patties I salt them on both sides. After the final flip I grind fresh pepper on the cooked side - pepper gets bitter when burned. If I did want to add flavorings I would grind my own meat for the burgers and add the flavorings then.  <sep>  Q: How should burger patties be prepared in terms of flavourings? A: My personal preference is the minimal disturbance method as it is fast, the patties hold together, and I like the flavor of pure beef. After forming the patties I salt them on both sides  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: So should I form the patty to a bare minimum so the strands of ground beef are still visible?

input: CONTEXT: I'm afraid you interpret the tables wrong. You aren't destroying calories, you are adding water (=0 cal) to the dry rice. As the rice absorbs the water, you are in fact measuring rice + water for cooked rice.This is true for calorie tables that measure by volume (like here) and by weight.If you are cooking your rice by boiling and straining, you are effectively losing a few calories due to the starch that gets drained with the water, but that's not what you asked here.  <sep>  Q: How to maintain the calories in rice (which were present in it in its raw form) after cooking it?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: What to doA dough should be generally risen by size anyway, not by time. But it is also very forgiving, so it will probably still give you decent edible bread if you do it by time. The best way is to wait until it has doubled, no matter what the clock shows. But you insist on going by the clock, don't change the time, wait the 30 minutes. It may be underproofed (with such a short time given by the recipe, there is virtually no chance of overproofing it), but the same would have happened if you were using the original amounts and going by the clock. Dough proofing and timeThe rising time for dough at room temperature is not affected by recipe scaling, the time it takes a specific dough to double will be the same regardless of the size of your batch. If the temperature in your proofing container is significantly different from the dough temperature, you will see some effect on rising times with different batch sizes and dough shapes, as the center of the dough will need some time to get to the same temperature as the proofing container, and warmer dough rises quicker than cold dough. This is unlikely to have a measurable effect at dough amounts used by home bakers, especially considering that the possible proofing temperature window is rather narrow.  <sep>  Q: How does halving a bread recipe impact rising time? A: the time it takes a specific dough to double will be the same regardless of the size of your batch  Q: Would doubling or tripleing the recipe make it to heavy to rise as fast? A: If the temperature in your proofing container is significantly different from the dough temperature, you will see some effect on rising times with different batch sizes and dough shapes  Q: So the temperature will effect the rising time? A: warmer dough rises quicker than cold dough  Q: Is there a suggested temperature to proof your bread at? A: room temperature  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Is that why recipes call for adding warm milk or water?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: As you probably know, volkornbrot and similar breads are designed to bake at a lower temperature for a longer time. 240 C sounds way too high to me. 150-180 C should be about right, and leave the bread in for a long time (up to 3 hours), until the loaf starts to pull away from the sides of the pan. Even after this baking process, because the bread batter is much wetter than a standard bread, you should not slice or eat the bread until it has had time to cool and ""rest,"" about 24 hours. If you slice it right away, the heat and moisture escape and the inside is still doughy/raw. If you wait, the moisture will have time to distribute throughout the loaf and the inside will firm up. Just be patient! The benefit is that the loaf should last for a very long time wrapped in plastic, especially if you put the unused portion in the fridge.  <sep>  Q: I tried to make black bread in the microwave, but why didn't it work?

input: CONTEXT: Some ingredients do not dissolve well in hot water - the starch swells and thickens, forming lumps that may have raw powder in them and are nasty. They need to be added to cold or lukewarm water and heated after they are dissolved. Other ingredients, most notably pasta, will partially dissolve in cold water making a thick gloppy soup. But if you add them to hot water they will ""seal"" (in a way) and stay together as they cook.  <sep>  Q: Why are some kind of packets-soups boiled up in lukewarm water, while normally just stirred into already boiling water?

input: CONTEXT: Adding herbs directly to baked goods usually results in very strong flavours. Infusing the sugar with the herbs gives a more subtle overtone rather than a full-on explosion. In some cases, of course, you might want a strong herb flavour, but where you just want a hint, infusing the sugar is great.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Generally speaking, frying gives a better crust due to the higher direct heat producing more Maillard flavours. A good, heavy, screaming hot pan is required. Oil the steak, not the pan, with vegetable or groundnut oil (olive oil will burn), and baste with butter towards the end for extra flavour.If your steak is thick, you might try a reverse sear - roast the steak at about 150Â°C until the centre is 10Â°C off your desired doneness level (if you don't have a digital probe thermometer, invest the small amount they cost, it is completely worth it), then sear the outside on your mega hot pan. This avoids you having to overdo the outside just to get the inside right.  <sep>  Q: Is it better to fry or grill a steak? A: frying  Q: What are the benefits of frying a steak?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: In my experience, rice can be cooked in any pot. I cook quite a lot of Japanese style dishes, and as far as I can tell the rice is cooked in the same way as any other.For myself, I've done it in good ""induction-able"" steel pots, as well as huge (navy galley) aluminium pots, and a couple of low-quality stainless steel things too. They're all fine.Normally, as soon as the pot is at/near boiling, turn the heat down to a low setting and leave it in the pot until it's ready. Then take it off the heat, but leave it covered (don't peek) for another five minutes.Generally, once you've added the water, you put the lid on. You only start the timer when it's boiled and you turn it down, though. That's probably why a glass lid is better, so you can see the boiling. It's not critical to the process, though.  <sep>  Q: Do I need a specific pot to cook Japanese-style rice?

input: CONTEXT: If the yeast isn't out of date then the most likely sounding culprit is the temperature of your water. It should be between 105-110. If it's too cool then you won't activate the yeast and if you get it too warm you'll start to kill it.Another possible case can be when you're adding the salt.

input: CONTEXT: It sounds very much like you didn't manage to completely dissolve the sugar. It's also possible to get a bad texture from ice crystals in your ice cream, but I don't think you'd describe it as gritty or sandy, just icy.It can be rather difficult to dissolve that much sugar in liquid, especially if it's cold straight from the fridge. You might want to try heating it gently and stirring, and being careful to go until there's no undissolved sugar hiding at the bottom.

input: CONTEXT: When metal is exposed to microwave radiation, an electric potential difference can develop as the microwaves generate electric charge in parts of the metal. Flowing electricity can cause sparks as electrons migrate to places of lower potential. Solid metal is susceptible to this because its electrons are relatively loose, making it a good conductor of electricity.Calcium (Ca) in milk is bonded with other atoms (mostly as calcium phosphate), so it doesn't behave as a solid metal would: first because its electrons are secured in bonds with other atoms, and second, because the Ca atoms are not aggregated together but intermixed with nonconducting ones.  <sep>  Q: How come heating milk in the microwave is safe? A: Calcium (Ca) in milk is bonded with other atoms (mostly as calcium phosphate), so it doesn't behave as a solid metal would: fi  Q: Why doesn't it behave the same?

And the same for the stuffing.Then you have to reheat them back up to a safe temperature ... the stuffing you can add extra liquid to, and make sure it gets up to the necessary temperature, but the turkey itelf is going to be difficult to reheat without drying out (maybe if it were brined it'd be better, but still less than ideal).I'd say in all, you'd save some time the day of, but the total time spent is going to be much longer, there's an increased risk of food-related illness, and there's an overall lower quality.If the main interest is in reducing cooking time, I'd start with not stuffing the bird. I'd also make sure that it's well thawed in advance (too many people leave it for the night before). If you really wanted to reduce time, you might be able to butterfly the bird, but it'd then be too wide for most ovens.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: There are arguments of the universal validity of such rules, but there has long been an argument that reheated meat that was pre-cooked should always be brought to full safe temperature.The general idea is that cooked or not there is bacteria present. If heated to only the 100-120F range, you have reached the temperature of highest active growth of many pathogens, without killing them. Some will argue that this is safe, as long as you eat the item immediately, not let it sit and give time for that bacterial growth to bloom. I would even put credence to this for items which I knew the preparation and handling history, but for prefab type foods, like ground meats and especially poultry, I personally would be reluctant to take risks, I would bring it to temp. There also has always been disclaimers that the reheating to temp rule only applies to if you reheat at all, for instance, medium rare roast beef is often eaten cold as leftover, but the rule stated if you reheat, the reheat to what would have originally be considered a safe temperature, not part way. With something like a prepped burger, again, I personally would not eat it cold, and just thawing it might put you into an unknown zone. I would heat it.  <sep>  Q: What is the minimum internal temperature for chicken? A: the 100-120F range  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Why do I need to hit a minimum temperature?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I haven't seen your recipe, but from looking at others, steamed pudding takes on the order of a couple hours of steaming. Doing it in the oven won't be any faster or less boring than steaming it - it may even be slower, since heat transfer from steam is pretty efficient. 45 minutes at 120Â°C would probably leave it undercooked, and if you cook at a higher temperature, you'll be missing the point - steaming for a long time lets it cook slowly and more evenly. You could work out how to cook it hotter and faster, but it wouldn't be a steamed pudding anymore, it'd be a ""normal"" pudding.If you want to do it in the oven, you should use a water bath to keep it from getting too hot - put the vessel with the pudding into a larger vessel, and add water to come most of the way up the sides of the pudding. Then you can increase the temperature of the oven, perhaps to 150-175Â°C, without overheating the pudding. But I doubt you'll be able to get the cooking time very much less than the original cooking time with steam without significantly changing the results.Finally (thanks Elendil), steaming helps keep the pudding moist, and an oven even with a water bath is not a terribly humid environment, so it might still be drier than desired. Covering tightly, and possibly adding a tiny bit more liquid, might help with that.  <sep>  Q: Is it okay to bake caramel pudding rather than steaming it?

input: CONTEXT: You're comparing different quantities. A serving of cream (per your label) is a tablespoon. You're comparing that to 1 cup (or 16 tablespoons) of milk. The percentage that you're seeing is not what percentage of your dairy product is fat, but the percentage of the recommended daily amount of that nutrient found in a single serving. % Daily Value is figured using 2000 total calories per person, per day.From @Jefromi in comments: ""And a tablespoon of cream is 15g, so with 5g of fat, that's indeed about 33%, right in the expected range.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: There's no reason why you couldn't boil vegetables as you make the stock and then puree them in as a base. It's really about taste and the result you want. Making the stock without vegetables in it will give you a clear broth with a simple pork flavor and the vegetables will be distinct in it. If you add vegetables while cooking the stock and then puree them in your base will be much more vegetable-y, and opaque - the color will be determined by the vegetables added. The pork taste will be a bit more hidden by vegetable flavors. Spices and herbs are 2 separate matters. In general you can overcook herbs very easily but it's hard to overcook spices (although some spices can change during long cooking times). Adding bay (laurel) is one of the exceptions herb-wise. Spice-wise adding at the beginning will make the spice permeate the meat, careful not to overdo it though.Like I said it's all about the look and taste you want.  <sep>  Q: Should I add vegetables and spices in the stock-making stage of pig-knuckle soup?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Yes, it can go bad.It's pretty much the same as the way flour can go bad: the fats can go rancid. Grains are mostly starch, but they contain enough fat for rancidity to be a noticeable problem. There's a huge amount of variability in how long that takes, though. If it's airtight and kept in a cool, dark place, it'll last much longer than the best before date. But if it's been exposed to air, light, or heat, it can go pretty fast, perhaps even before the best before date.So, smell it. If you detect any unpleasant smells, you probably don't want to eat it. Even if you don't smell anything obvious, it could still be subtly rancid, so if you're planning on serving it to anyone, you might want to cook a small bit to test.  <sep>  Q: Does polenta go off'?

input: CONTEXT: I have used excess ginger by candying it- I boil it for about twenty minutes in a simple syrup, when I take the ginger out of the syrup I place it on a cooling grate and let it cool completely. I then roll each individual piece in turbinado sugar(I have used white sugar too.) To store I place it in a plastic bag with a little extra sugar to prevent the pieces from sticking to each other. I also keep the syrup tightly sealed in the freezer, the syrup is great for cocktails, or as a remedy for an upset stomach. I have also peeled leftover ginger and stored it in a tightly sealed container inside my freezer.

input: CONTEXT: Marshmallows expand so much because the water in them becomes steam, and gas takes up a LOT more volume than liquid.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I haven't seen your recipe, but from looking at others, steamed pudding takes on the order of a couple hours of steaming. Doing it in the oven won't be any faster or less boring than steaming it - it may even be slower, since heat transfer from steam is pretty efficient. 45 minutes at 120Â°C would probably leave it undercooked, and if you cook at a higher temperature, you'll be missing the point - steaming for a long time lets it cook slowly and more evenly. You could work out how to cook it hotter and faster, but it wouldn't be a steamed pudding anymore, it'd be a ""normal"" pudding.If you want to do it in the oven, you should use a water bath to keep it from getting too hot - put the vessel with the pudding into a larger vessel, and add water to come most of the way up the sides of the pudding. Then you can increase the temperature of the oven, perhaps to 150-175Â°C, without overheating the pudding. But I doubt you'll be able to get the cooking time very much less than the original cooking time with steam without significantly changing the results.Finally (thanks Elendil), steaming helps keep the pudding moist, and an oven even with a water bath is not a terribly humid environment, so it might still be drier than desired. Covering tightly, and possibly adding a tiny bit more liquid, might help with that.  <sep>  Q: Is it okay to bake caramel pudding rather than steaming it? A: steaming helps keep the pudding moist, and an oven even with a water bath is not a terribly humid  Q: What if i put a pan of water in the oven?

input: CONTEXT: Either oil will work just fine for infusing with chillies, at the end of the day just about any cooking oil will work. Infusing oil with chilli won't change its cooking properties, and both those oils will store fine long-term. If you are going to go for a cold infusion then it's highly recommended that you dry your chillies first so you get a long lasting result. If you don't dry them they will get mushy and rot in the oil, which isn't very pleasant. Drying them in your oven will stink up your house big-time, but it's worth it. Alternatively you can make chili strings with them and they will air dry, or you can freeze them for years and they'll stay good.  <sep>  Q: Can I use olive oil to infuse with chili?

input: CONTEXT: I have used excess ginger by candying it- I boil it for about twenty minutes in a simple syrup, when I take the ginger out of the syrup I place it on a cooling grate and let it cool completely. I then roll each individual piece in turbinado sugar(I have used white sugar too.) To store I place it in a plastic bag with a little extra sugar to prevent the pieces from sticking to each other. I also keep the syrup tightly sealed in the freezer, the syrup is great for cocktails, or as a remedy for an upset stomach. I have also peeled leftover ginger and stored it in a tightly sealed container inside my freezer. This is convienent because when you need ginger, you can easily grate the frozen ginger for your recipe. Generally you can store it frozen for at least a good three months. Hope this helps.  <sep>  Q: What to do with ginger leftover from ginger ale production? A: I have used excess ginger by candying it  Q: some kind of candy?

input: CONTEXT: Unless you're straining the soup, I'd assume that the whole vs. cracked isn't going to be helpful in removing them, although I will admit that I can't recall seeing a recipe that called for whole peppercorns that didn't require cracking them.Part of the reason for whole pepercorns is the surface area -- if you crack it, you'll create more surface area, and for the same amount of pepper, there'd be more pepper flavor.It's also possible that there's a difference between the chemicals available in the outer hull of the peppercorn vs. the middle, but I don't know how you'd compare, simply because the cracked pepper would be more overpowering.  <sep>  Q: Why whole peppercorns in recipes?

input: CONTEXT: Sure you can. It will not taste salty, but it also will not taste bland, it will have a ""seasoned"" taste. Will you like it that way, or miss the salt? That's not something we can predict (or you, for that matter, if you have not tried it before). You have to taste it so you can know if you personally enjoy eating saltless, umami food. When trying, make sure that you are using very small quantities. Measure in knifetips, not in teaspoons, add one at the time and stir well. You can easily overdo it, and there is no way to go back. Pay speciall attention to the feeling of ""It's not good yet"" - it can come from ""not enough seasoning"" or from ""not enough salt"", in the second case adding more MSG won't help.  <sep>  Q: Ran out of salt can I use MSG (monosodium glutamate) instead?

A sour icing, or a sour sauce to serve it with, might be a better bet in that vein.So unfortunately, you'd be best off shopping around for cake mixes that are more the level of sweetness you want. You might be able to use the nutrition facts to help get a sense of how sweet they are before you buy them.  <sep>  Q: Can you tell me how to make a cake mix less sweet?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The recipe calls for ground almonds. This can be done in a food processor. You may wish to remove the almonds' skins beforehand, and you also may wish to toast them. Both of those are very common, even though neither is essential. With this particular recipe, I'd be inclined to toast them but leave the skins on. Once you've made those decisions, measure out the sugar called for in the recipe. Set it aside. Then place the almonds in the processor and add two or three heaping tablespoons of the measured sugar. Pulse until you reach a grind that resembles a meal, or very course flour. The finer you grind the almonds, the more carefully you must watch them. Eventually, the almonds will begin to turn to a paste. The sugar is helping to prevent it, and that's helping you to get a finer grind. However, overprocess and the almonds will turn to paste. If you're carefully watching for it, though, you'll see it begin to happen before it goes too far.  <sep>  Q: How do I grind almonds for making marzipan?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Substitution in preserved foods are generally considered unsafe. Food chemistry is a complicated affair, and cooking is inherently imprecise. Sure, you can find a way to reduce the pH to that of the original recipe. But a salami is a fermented food. Your pH might be the same, but other things will change, for example the composition of the available sugars, and you can catch a different strain of bacteria. Safe preservation recipes have either been extensively tested in a lab, or used for centuries. Making a small change can destroy the delicate balance which leads to a tasty, safe food. The solution here is to look for another recipe, one which is safe but does not contain wine. For something as risky as cured meat, I'd suggest not getting some random recipe off the Internet, but choosing from a book, or maybe from the blog of a known, respectable author. This way, you get both good taste and safety, things which are hit-and-miss when making your own substitutions.  <sep>  Q: What can you substitute for wine when making homemade salami? A: The solution here is to look for another recipe, one which is safe but does not contain wine  Q: Most of the recipes I found use wine. Would citric acid work as a replacement?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Mast O Khiar, as you mention mainly consist of plain yogurt and cucumbers and most recipe do not require much more than that. Because of such, the shelf life for the yogurt product will be the shelf life of the yogurt itself. If it is a store bought yogurt, then the shelf life should be about 2 weeks in the refrigerator.Make sure to store the sauce in an air-tight container. Most tubberware should work. Those soup containers from Chinese takeout orders work perfectly.EDIT: After a bit of a debate in cooking chat, I decided to change my answer a little. The reason I said 2 week is because personally I had eaten 2 week old Mast O Khiar. However it could be recipe dependant so it could be different for a different recipe. However it is very easy to tell whether yogurt OR cucumber is bad.Mast O Khiar should have a very fresh/clean aroma. When yogurt turn bad, it releases a rancid smell. If it smells bad, dont eat it.If you see fuzzy mold it's a good idea to throw it out.  <sep>  Q: I made kubideh kabobs with saffron rice for my fiance and I last night, and it was a huge success. However, my fiance wished we had some mast o khiar (yogurt-cucumber sauce) to go with it, as what we would normally get from a kabob takeout place### Now, given that this is the first time Persian food has ever been made in this house, I have concerns about any reasonably sized batch of this yogurt sauce being consumed in time.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Garlic flavors are soluble in oil, simply chopping up garlic and putting it in with the rice will not distribute the flavor well. I would recommend you chop the garlic finely and then infuse into a tablespoon of oil or butter by putting the pan on very low heat for a few minutes. Then add the rice and stir to coat the grains with the infused oil before adding water and cooking as normal. How much garlic to use depends on how strong your garlic is and how garlic-y you want it to taste. 5 tbsp of rice isn't much, for a medium garlic flavor using average strength garlic a whole small clove or half a large is probably enough. With the garlic I grow I'd add a few slices from a clove at most. Another option would be to cook the rice and then stir in the garlic infused oil afterwards, The benefits to this option are that you can drain the rice after cooking without all the flavor going down the drain.  <sep>  Q: What is the best way to infuse garlic flavor in the bland brown rice?

input: CONTEXT: Marshmallows expand so much because the water in them becomes steam, and gas takes up a LOT more volume than liquid. Specifically, 1 mL of water becomes ~1.36 LITERS of vapor, before it gets heated further. That's 1000-fold expansion, before you add additional expansion as the gas is heated. Marshmallows don't have all that much water content, but when it's trapped in a stretchy gelatin matrix that holds gas readily, it only takes a bit to blow the whole thing up like a balloon.You are correct that the gas expansion on its own is insufficient; unless I've badly muddled my calculations, gas expansion from 20C to ~150C (caramelization temperature) will increase the gas volume by under 50%.  <sep>  Q: Why do marshmallow get so puffed up in the microwave?

I've had problems making foam because of hard/basic tap water (a lot of chalk in the water) - making frape though, not garlic foam:) Foam will more easily form in soft water as you can easily test with a piece of soap. If you have hard tap water you could try using boiled water (some of the chalk in the water will react and leave a residue on the bottom of the pot) or bottled water with pH 7 (neutral).

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I've never tried steaming bok choy, but yes, the ribs and leafy bits cook at different speeds.For stir frys I trim the bottom so the ribs come free, clean off any dirt that's gotten trapped in between, then stack up the leaves and cut the leaves from the ribs. I slice the ribs into about 5mm / 3/16"" slices, and add them towards the end; the leaves I cut into ribbons (perpendicular to the ribs), and stir them in at the last second, so they barely cook. The center I just chop the top off the leafy bit, and slice the more rib-like bits a litte larger than the rest of the ribs (they're thinner, so cook faster).As I've never tried steaming it, and I don't tend to cook in bags (except for silver turtles when camping), this is going to be a complete guess. Now, it tastes fine al dente, so you could leave the ribs as large as I use for a stir fry, but en papillote tends to be fancier cooking, so I'd probably try for maybe 1/6"" slices or a little thicker (maybe 2-3mm), and if you had a mandoline so they all came out even, that'd be great. I'd still cut the leaves into ribbons, just because it's easier to eat than a huge intact leaf.I'd assume that the leaves would cook at a similar rate as spinich, and the ribs closer to fennel, if that helps at all.  <sep>  Q: How should I prepare Bok Choy before I cook it?

Since it has plenty of sugar in it, you can use it for pretty much anything, including things like coatings, or even just eat some.The 100% is unsweetened (there's no room for any sugar in there) so it's really only usable for things like baking, where you'll add some sugar. It's unlikely to be pleasant to eat on its own.For what it's worth, usually in English you'll hear cacao only when referring to the overall cacao seeds and their use as a component of chocolate.

input: CONTEXT: Gelatin sheets are soaked in cold-to-room-temp water in order to soften and rehydrate them slightly before stirring them into the (often hot) food. If you were to try to stir a sheet of gelatin directly into hot liquid, you'd find that it behaves a lot like cornstarch. It clumps up immediately and produces unpleasant-to-eat chunks that only a blender and a chinois have a hope of removing.You squeeze it after soaking to remove excess (unflavored) water from the exterior. Otherwise, each sheet might bring along quite a bit of water, which will seriously affect the consistency of a product you expect to set up, and might affect the taste of even something like a braise to which you are adding the gelatin just for body.  <sep>  Q: Why do we soak and squeeze gelatine?###I can only assume we use gelatine with liquids (or at least the majority of time it's to set a liquid) - so why soak it first?

input: CONTEXT: Ripening of the avocado is slowed down greatly by refrigeration, so it is usually a good idea to let the avocado ripen fully at room temperature. Once it is ripe, it can be stored in the refrigerator for at least a week. This way, it is ready to use whenever you want it. Fortunately, there is a day or two when the avocado is ripe, but not too ripe, so if you check on it everyday when ripening, you will be able to save it at the correct ripeness without worrying about it too much.Putting an unripened avocado in the refrigerator may prevent it from ever ripening completely. Once cooled to near freezing (40F in most refrigerators), it seems that some avocados (maybe it depends on the type) don't ripen anymore, even when removed to room temperature.  <sep>  Q: Will avocado stay fresh longer if stored in the refrigerator?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Chocolate is an odd substance when it comes to melting and hardening. When chocolate hardens, its melting point will end up being just a few degrees higher than the hardening temperature.When chocolate crystallizes at high temperatures, it forms a strong, dense crystalline structure that, texture-wise, is quite brittle. Most bought chocolate (baker's chocolate and chips) is already tempered, but when you melt it, you break down that crystalline structure, and if you harden it at room temperature then it ends up forming very weak crystals that will melt in your hand.If you use a special coating chocolate (couverture or the lower-quality compound chocolate) then you don't need to worry so much about tempering (although it's still a good idea), but if you use ordinary chocolate and don't temper it then your coating will end up being messy and wet and rub off on your hands while you eat it. It might even melt while stored.Tempering is the key to making a room-temperature-stable chocolate coating. If you don't do this, you'll need to keep your pastries refrigerated until they're ready to consume.  <sep>  Q: What is the purpose of tempering chocolate?

input: CONTEXT: Fish sauce! I think the clam juice is probably already a substitute for fish sauce anyway, so it should make a very good substitute. (If you look up recipes for Thai beef salad you'll find tons of things with fish sauce, and probably not much with clam juice.)You probably want to use less, though, maybe starting with 2-4 tablespoons, though I've seen recipes using more.It should be fine for the dietary restriction too; it's just made with anchovies, not an unknown blend of seafood, but of course check the label just in case.  <sep>  Q: What can I use instead of clam juice?

input: CONTEXT: The most common reason for leakage with Cordon Bleu Chicken is that the packets are too thick, which makes it impossible to get a perfect fold; you need to pound the breasts very thin - less than 1/2"", maybe a little more than 1/4"".The other ""trick"" is to make a small cut along the folded edge of the breast after you fold and seal the packets, which essentially makes it almost like a sandwich; the top and bottom parts can move independently and you don't have tension trying to pull the top piece away.Just don't cut so deep that you cause an immediate leak; if you've pounded the breast to 1/3"" thickness, then your cut should be no more than about 1/8"".If you do it this way, you shouldn't even need to use toothpicks; I never do, and I haven't sprung a single leak in my last 20 or so preparations.  <sep>  Q: How can I keep the cheese from leaking out of my cordon bleu during cooking?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: In the fridge, an hour should not be a problem, but could still end up bitter depending on the kind of onion used. Usually, Marinades, Pestos etc. that use mashed onions and/or garlic taste best if they are made the way the name ""Pesto"" suggests: Cutting stuff very fine, then using a mortar and pestle. Most explanations WHY that is the case have to with the fact that blenders tend to disintegrate cell walls with relatively rough cuts of a fast but half-sharp or blunt blade, releasing more enzymes etc. from the cell walls as opposed to from the cell contents. These are plausible, since some of the compounds in different parts of onion cells are known to actively react when the onion is disintegrated.Also, try adding oil (which you often want in a marinade anyway. No unrefined olive oil in a blender, though - that is known to get bitter!) while mortaring or blending - this will help extract flavor compounds and probably provide some oxidation protection.There is a well known marinade working with onions, garlic etc: Bulgogi marinade.  <sep>  Q: How long can blended onions stay relatively fresh?

input: CONTEXT: I'd say it depends. If you are dead-set on observing all food safety rules, the pizzas are probably unsafe to eat. But in the real world, it is possible to bend some of those rules and get by unscathed. But you have to be smart about it--not all rules safely bend as far as others.What was on the pizzas? Shrimp? Chicken? Raw sausage? Those things have a pretty short safety window. Cured meats like pepperoni are safer longer (that's why they're cured in the first place).How hot was your kitchen?How long did they sit out?And then of course it comes down also to how long and how hot you're cooking things. You might well be able to kill off germs in things that aren't outright spoiled. Pizza isn't that long-cooking, so there's risk there.Ultimately, you have to be the arbiter of safety. Check the USDA website about food safety and follow every rule if you want to feel certain.  <sep>  Q: Homemade pizza left out overnight, is it safe to eat? A: I'd say it depends.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I don't think this has a single answer: The amount of alcohol would depend on the alcohol content of the soaking liquor or liqueur, soaking time, temperature of chocolate, and how thick the strawberry was. I suspect uncut strawberries would take at least several days to fully absorb alcohol and reach equilibrium, but the surface should take up alcohol fairly quickly. If they are cut up, exposing the more porous interior, I imagine an overnight soak would be sufficient to reach maximum alcohol content. The enormous, bloated mutant strawberries you sometimes see at stores could take considerably longer than others to absorb their maximum alcohol. Alcohol is much more volatile than water, so the immersion in warm, melted chocolate would remove some alcohol, but once the chocolate cools, it should trap any remaining content.The flavor of alcohol is easily masked by other flavors at under 20% content; this could explain why your friend didn't taste it, but you did. It's quite possible the strawberries packed a sobriety-busting punch, but it was disguised by the chocolate and fruit tastes.  <sep>  Q: How much alcohol remains in strawberries soaked in alcohol?

input: CONTEXT: I think grilling is probably a bad plan for duck legs; the fat content is a real danger like you said, and duck legs are tough enough you probably want to confit them or braise them.If you absolutely have to grill them, I would suggest confiting them at 200 degrees for three or four hours first (you could use veggie oil in a pinch) and then resting them in the fridge for a day or so in oil. As for finishing them on the grill, rinse them off gently, re-season if needed, cook flesh side down on a medium heat portion of the grill for a while until mostly heated through, then flip them over on a high heat portion of the grill to crisp up the skin, watching out for flares.  <sep>  Q: Tips for grilling duck legs?

input: CONTEXT: Advance warning: I haven't tried this.It seems that you don't want to remove the ovaries because that would affect the shape, but you do want to remove the capsaicin from them. It's soluble in fat and alcohol, so you could try making a small hole in the bottom and pumping a light vegetable oil or vodka through from the other end using a syringe. Obviously you're likely to end up with some solvent trapped inside, and you might also wash away some of the flavours you're trying to preserve, so experimentation would be necessary.  <sep>  Q: toning down the fresh chilli picquancy###I like to use green finger chillies in my curries more for the flavour than for the heat, but in order for me to be able to cook out the rawness of the chillies, I end up with the chillies all ""melted"" in the pan, looking more like leaves, i.e they lose shape.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Chilis supply 2 things, chili flavor and heat. The flavor comes from the flesh while the heat comes from the seeds and especially the membrane that connects the seeds to the flesh. Ordinarily when someone wants to reduce the heat of a pepper I would suggest cutting it open and removing the seeds and membrane, however that's pretty much impossible with a dried pepper. My recommendation in this case would be to put the chipotles in whole, then remove them after cooking is done. Put the peppers in after all the other ingredients, just before simmering, then try to avoid stirring it if you can avoid it - be gentle so you don't burst the peppers open. Once the cooking is done you fish them out with a spoon and you can serve them as a side to the heat lovers if you like.  <sep>  Q: What other changes could I expect?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Basically, you can refreeze the raspberries.When a fruit or veg. is frozen, the water inside the plant cell expands, and bursts the cell wall, which is why there is so much 'juice' when you thaw. If you refreeze, you can be sure that the raspberries will freeze into a giant block. If you are using them to make a sauce or a jam, this is not significant. That being said, if you are using frozen raspberries in the first place, you are obviously not looking for a perfectly intact raspberry, you are using them for some other purpose. Therefor, refreezing is no big deal. I recently answered another question about freezing and refreezing, and how it is basically a myth that it renders the refrozen product inedible. Any time you freeze you know that you are not going to get 'exactly' the same product when you thaw it, and the same goes with refreezing, there is always a 'slight' degredation of the product with each successive freeze (do you like my liberal usage of quotes?) You won't poison yourself or anything like that, you should have no worries.That being said, what are you doing with the berries? Certainly a refrozen raspberry should be no worse that a raspberry frozen once.  <sep>  Q: Can I re-freeze fruit? A: f you refreeze, you can be sure that the raspberries will freeze into a giant block  Q: I had let them thaw but have put them in the fridge since I realised my mistake. Am I able to refreeze the berries or should I find some immediate use for them? A: refreezing is no big deal  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: What are the risks / consequences if I do refreeze?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The primary reason is definitely convenience. If you don't want skin and seeds in your sauce, then you have to do some work to avoid it. Yes, it's possible, e.g. passing through a food mill, or blanching and peeling plus retaining only the flesh, but having it already done is a whole lot easier.Passata is usually much thicker too, so it won't need as long a cooking time to reduce into a non-watery sauce as fresh tomatoes. On top of that, you don't have to worry about whether you can find good fresh tomatoes, e.g. if it's winter and they're out of season.Your two cases for comparison seem to overlook this: if you just chop and cook, you'll have skin and seeds in your sauce, as well as excess liquid to cook down, while if you use passata, you won't. (Also, for what it's worth, you'd need pretty giant tomatoes to get the equivalent of 3/4 cup of passata out of one tomato.)Of course, if you don't mind skin and seeds, it's also perfectly fine to simply cook fresh tomatoes and be done with it.Note that you can often get similar advantages from other canned tomato products. In the US, crushed tomatoes are far more common, and a roughly similar texture. (Peeled whole tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste can also be useful depending on what texture you're aiming for.)  <sep>  Q: Why specifically use Passata, rather than tomatoes, in Ragu? A: The primary reason is definitely convenience. If you don't want skin and seeds in your sauce, then you have to do some work to avoid it  Q: Are there any other reasons to use passata? A: much thicker too, so it won't need as long a cooking time to reduce into a non-watery sauce as fresh tomatoes.

input: CONTEXT: Sous vide cooking is a function of temperature and the surface area to volume ratio of the food in question.If you have a high surface area to volume the cooking time will be shorter. Steaks would have a higher ratio than the roast so they would take less time than the roast. The amount of the time difference is difficult to predict exactly over such a long time scale, but a rough calculation of the ratio I spoke of would be a good starting point for a compensation factor.If you have the time and your water bath can accommodate, I'd suggest keeping the roast whole and finishing in a skillet.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Yes, it can go bad.It's pretty much the same as the way flour can go bad: the fats can go rancid. Grains are mostly starch, but they contain enough fat for rancidity to be a noticeable problem. There's a huge amount of variability in how long that takes, though. If it's airtight and kept in a cool, dark place, it'll last much longer than the best before date. But if it's been exposed to air, light, or heat, it can go pretty fast, perhaps even before the best before date.So, smell it. If you detect any unpleasant smells, you probably don't want to eat it. Even if you don't smell anything obvious, it could still be subtly rancid, so if you're planning on serving it to anyone, you might want to cook a small bit to test.  <sep>  Q: Does polenta 'go off'?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Water absorption by flour varies by variety, brand, and even batch within brand. For example, I have an American bread book where I quite often have to use far more water than the recipe suggests to achieve the consistency stated. This is down to my British flour apparently absorbing more water.Therefore, it's a good idea to simply use enough flour to get the desired consistency rather than worry too much about being precise. Having said that, when it comes to bread, wetter is better, so only add enough so that you can just work it comfortably.  <sep>  Q: do you know anything about Salt stick dough and shaping?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: In my experience, that is completely normal and will not harm its flavor at all. You just need to warm it up before serving so that you can re-mix / emulsify your sauce / dressing. It congeals in the fridge much like any other fat will (think butter or bacon grease). Apparently, extra virgin olive oil may suffer from condensation in the bottle affecting the flavor. It may also turn cloudy. But in general, you should be fine. Even if it does go bad, it should just affect the flavor and not be harmful, just gross. So if it tastes bad, toss it.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: As baka has said, more volatile components of the wine will be released with more wine surface exposed.Also, this not only releases aroma but also helps the wine to ""breathe"" and oxidize, which is why you open the red wine bottle half an hour before serving it (so that this process starts), and why you might pour the wine into a decanter.This process accentuates the flavors and aromas of the wine. It is not very much necessary with younger, colder served wines (e.g. vinho verde).In young, sparkling wine, a larger glass will disperse the bubbles faster, as well as warming it. This is undesireable, hence the smaller, narrower glasses.Aged white wine should behave similarly to aged red wine, although it doesn't need to breathe as much.  <sep>  Q: Why are red wine glasses wider than white wine glasses? A: In young, sparkling wine, a larger glass will disperse the bubbles faster, as well as warming it. This is undesireable, hence the smaller, narrower glasses  Q: that's interesting.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Generally speaking, frying gives a better crust due to the higher direct heat producing more Maillard flavours. A good, heavy, screaming hot pan is required. Oil the steak, not the pan, with vegetable or groundnut oil (olive oil will burn), and baste with butter towards the end for extra flavour.If your steak is thick, you might try a reverse sear - roast the steak at about 150Â°C until the centre is 10Â°C off your desired doneness level (if you don't have a digital probe thermometer, invest the small amount they cost, it is completely worth it), then sear the outside on your mega hot pan. This avoids you having to overdo the outside just to get the inside right.  <sep>  Q: Is it better to fry or grill a steak? A: Generally speaking, frying gives a better crust due to the higher direct heat producing more Maillard flavours  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Would a grill pan be good to use on the hob instead of a standard frying pan?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The key difference from my perspective is cleaning. Silicone is the easiest material in my kitchen to scrub clean, with the possible exception of stainless steel. Cloth is very far down the list.Also, depending on the texture of the cloth, more food will almost certainly stick to the cloth, unless it's sealed with something, in which case what is it sealed with? And how is it sealing the fiberglass in?I use the kind with a thin grid of fibers inside the silicone. It adds more stability and lets the overall thickness be thinner for better heat transmission, compared to a plain silicone silpat. As long as I don't use it as a cutting board, the fiberglass stays safely inside. It does add a very slight grid texture to the bottom of loaves, but it's barely noticeable and doesn't look bad at all.The pyramid kind, which would reduce food contact and increase drainage and airflow, sounds like it would be good for specific applications, but not something I'd make a batch of cookies on.  <sep>  Q: What are the differences between cloth, fiberglass and silicone baking mats?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: To prevent the sticking, you might want to use a spray oil, maybe even just on the foil before you put the vegetables and potatoes on. It's a tiny amount of oil, not enough to make things noticeably greasy, but will be pretty effective. Another spray over the top will make them brown a little more nicely and may even prevent a little drying out. Alternatively, you can just toss them all in a bowl with a small amount of oil; it really doesn't take much, and I'd hardly describe it as ""covering with a lot of oil.""As for preventing things from drying out, first and foremost, don't overcook them. Broccoli and onions both roast very nicely, but you definitely want to pull it out before it starts browning/burning too much. If you slice the potatoes thinly enough, they'll cook in roughly the same amount of time as the broccoli and onions. So if things are getting overcooked, just don't leave them in the oven as long.You can also always try covering them. Another sheet of foil over the top will trap a fair amount of moisture, letting them steam a bit and probably preventing some burning as well.(I suppose it's also possible that it's all drying out because you're cooking them too slowly, so they have plenty of time for moisture to escape, but that seems less likely given the way you described things.)  <sep>  Q: When I cook my meat, I usually bake or broil it, I basically use the oven. I like using the oven to make the side dish while baking the meat. Usually the side dish consists of a combination of sweet potatoes / yams, broccoli and onions. I slice the potatoes and make sure the broccoli pieces and onions are large enough so they will not overcook / burn. However, usually this combination ends up being really dry, and everything sticks to the aluminum foil. ###So im looking to bake side dishes, having problems with dryness A: To prevent the sticking, you might want to use a spray oil, maybe even just on the foil before you put the vegetables and potatoes on  Q: what kind of oil is best? A: Another spray over the top will make them brown a little more nicely and may even prevent a little drying out  Q: Do you know of any alternatives to prevent the dryness? A: preventing things from drying out, first and foremost, don't overcook them. Broccoli and onions both roast very nicely, but you definitely want to pull it out before it starts browning  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: I might just have to revert to boiling the potatoes and broccoli, although I have never heard of boiling onions.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: For the same reason that fast food burgers are often dry :) When beef hits high heat, the juices go in the opposite direction. This is why when pan-frying a steak, you know it's close to medium rare once you see the juices start to come through the top. The fat in burgers does the same thing, it moves away from the heat source, and back into the rest of the meat. That's just what happens when meat cooks and constricts. Many fast food joints use a double grill (you pull an inverted flat top down on top of the burger on the flat top). Whoops, there goes practically everything moist in the 3 or so minutes they cook them.Using steam, you make this a much gentler process. As the patty is cooking from the top and bottom and sides at once, but with a more gentle heat, the fat (and some juices) come out instead of going to hide on the other side of the patty that isn't on a heat source.  <sep>  Q: How does adding water to the pan help the burger become better ? A: Using steam, you make this a much gentler process. As the patty is cooking from the top and bottom and sides at once  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Will the burger get too soggy if I add water ?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: The professional (read: industrial) solution would be maltodextrin powder. It is rather tasteless, has good solubility in liquids, and doesn't change much texturewise. In homemade spice mixes, the popular filler solution are dried breadcrumbs of a very small size (like breadcrumbs for schnitzel breading). They are noticeable, because the mix gets gritty, but the consensus among those who do it is that this is a feature, not a bug. They could also slightly thicken a wet dish (soup, stew), but present no problem when strewn over dry food. You can also use a nut flour made of nuts without much of an own taste, like apricot kernels or low quality overdried almonds. Again, this will be somewhat gritty, but not as hard as the breadcrumn solution.  <sep>  Q: What would make a good, flavorless extender/filler for my spice mix?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: I don't think this has a single answer: The amount of alcohol would depend on the alcohol content of the soaking liquor or liqueur, soaking time, temperature of chocolate, and how thick the strawberry was. I suspect uncut strawberries would take at least several days to fully absorb alcohol and reach equilibrium, but the surface should take up alcohol fairly quickly. If they are cut up, exposing the more porous interior, I imagine an overnight soak would be sufficient to reach maximum alcohol content. The enormous, bloated mutant strawberries you sometimes see at stores could take considerably longer than others to absorb their maximum alcohol. Alcohol is much more volatile than water, so the immersion in warm, melted chocolate would remove some alcohol, but once the chocolate cools, it should trap any remaining content.The flavor of alcohol is easily masked by other flavors at under 20% content; this could explain why your friend didn't taste it, but you did. It's quite possible the strawberries packed a sobriety-busting punch, but it was disguised by the chocolate and fruit tastes.  <sep>  Q: How much alcohol remains in strawberries soaked in alcohol?

input: CONTEXT: Unless you're straining the soup, I'd assume that the whole vs. cracked isn't going to be helpful in removing them, although I will admit that I can't recall seeing a recipe that called for whole peppercorns that didn't require cracking them.Part of the reason for whole pepercorns is the surface area -- if you crack it, you'll create more surface area, and for the same amount of pepper, there'd be more pepper flavor.It's also possible that there's a difference between the chemicals available in the outer hull of the peppercorn vs. the middle, but I don't know how you'd compare, simply because the cracked pepper would be more overpowering.  <sep>  Q: Why whole peppercorns?

input: CONTEXT: The brown stringy fibers form in the avocado flesh after it is bruised or the avocado is past ripe.The way to avoid this is to plan ahead. Buy your avocados when they are green and very hard. Try to select ones that have not been abused (at least if you see one being knocked around, take a different one). When you get the avocados home, set them aside in a safe place for a couple/few days, & don't drop or manhandle them in the meantime. When they are ripe (yield slightly to gentle pressure, as they say) you have a couple days to use them. Putting them in the refrigerator can prolong their niceness a little bit if you are not quite ready to use them.

Lastly, very slightly simmer this on low heat for 1 hour or so, stirring occasionally. Flavor is awesome. Any kinds of beans can be prepared in this way, and it is similar (varying on oil and legume variety) to other paste concoctions created elsewhere.. such as in the middle east.Note that this method negates the need for lots of ""mashing"".

input: CONTEXT: Your clarification means a lot -- ""baked"" potato in the U.S. tends to be a whole potato cooked on its own, where the insides become fluffy and creamy, and is done with larger starchy white potatoes, or sweet potatoes work well, too.Roasted potatoes, on the other hand, tends to be (in the U.S.) be smaller ""new"" potatoes, waxy potatoes, or even larger starchy potatoes cut up (eg, 'oven fries').The starchy potatoes only really hold up well when roasting if it's very high heat or a short amount of time -- if you're going to be cooking them with the roast as there's going to be moisture in there, I'd go for a waxy potato (eg, Red Bliss).As for the browning -- probably coat them well with oil, and if they're not brown enough for your liking when you pull the roast, as you're going to have to rest it anyway, drain the meat juices, crank the oven up to somewhere around 450F (230C) and leave the potatoes in for a few extra minutes.ps. yes, I know a sweet potato isn't a potato. And I also tend to use Yukon Gold for just about everything, as it makes great baked potatoes, and roasted potatoes (although, not sure how well with a roast at the same time) and they're good in pot roast and stews if you don't add them too early.  <sep>  Q: What are the best potatoes for baking? A: I also tend to use Yukon Gold for just about everything, as it makes great baked potatoes  Q: Are those suitable for baking with a roast that will give a nice golden brown finish on the outside? A: they're good in pot roast and stews if you don't add them too early  Q: Do you have any other suggestions for cooking/baking with potatoes? A: if you're going to be cooking them with the roast as there's going to be moisture in there, I'd go for a waxy potato (eg, Red Bliss  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: This is different from Yukon Gold then?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: If the flour is self-rising flour, then it shouldn't be allowed to sit for too long. However, this wouldn't result in it being ""impossible to pour"" - it would just prevent the item(s) from rising properly when baked.If I had to guess, I would point to the chocolate as the culprit. If your batter/dough recipe uses melted chocolate (as opposed to just cocoa powder) then it is almost certainly going to solidify again as it cools.

input: CONTEXT: I'd suggest skinless bone-in chicken thighs, as they have plenty of fat and collagen to keep them moist and tasty. I've cooked them in French-style wine-based stews, not to mention cacciatorre, for 2-3 hours before now and they just fall off the bone. It is virtually impossible to overcook them, unless you boil them mercilessly for hours. Just get a nice gentle simmer going - not only will this make the meat tender, but it will improve the flavour of the tomato sauce as well.Do not use chicken breast - it is far too lean.  <sep>  Q: what is a Substitution for beef (veal) in a stew?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Some of the volatile flavors will be diminished, but I've managed to make fairly good drinks with the help of mint that I kept frozen. In my experience, freezer burn starts to become visible after two or three months, and starts to harm flavor probably around 4-6 months.I'm not sure preparing the drink will work really well, but if you just defrost the drink in the refrigerator, it probably won't be terrible. Active thawing with heat will probably cause some harm. Many infusions and teas become a bit cloudy and lose color after bottling or freezing, which is why most bottled teas use an enzyme (not usually a listed ingredient) designed to mitigate that.  <sep>  Q: Would freezing affect the flavour of mint tea?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: There's no reason why you couldn't boil vegetables as you make the stock and then puree them in as a base. It's really about taste and the result you want. Making the stock without vegetables in it will give you a clear broth with a simple pork flavor and the vegetables will be distinct in it. If you add vegetables while cooking the stock and then puree them in your base will be much more vegetable-y, and opaque - the color will be determined by the vegetables added. The pork taste will be a bit more hidden by vegetable flavors. Spices and herbs are 2 separate matters. In general you can overcook herbs very easily but it's hard to overcook spices (although some spices can change during long cooking times). Adding bay (laurel) is one of the exceptions herb-wise. Spice-wise adding at the beginning will make the spice permeate the meat, careful not to overdo it though.Like I said it's all about the look and taste you want.  <sep>  Q: Should I add vegetables and spices in the stock-making stage of pig-knuckle soup?

That is a long time for the food to cool down/seal, etc. The processing time is usually carefully calculated so that the core of the product in the jar gets to the proper temp. With the processing time only being 10 mins it would mean only the jar and maybe a small amount on the edges would have gotten to 240 deg F. I suppose it could make a difference if it was a hot pack vs. cold pack, but I would still not risk it.Since you're an experienced canner, I assume you already know that it's possible to lose pressure during the process and then restart the time when the canner gets back up to pressure, but that is usually a few minutes at most, not hours.  <sep>  Q: If there was an interruption in canning process, would the meat still be safe?

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: Mixing it with milk (or liquid in general) is probably just to remove clumps. It clumps easily, especially when things aren't perfectly airtight (probably more common in your grandmother's time), and mixing in a small amount of liquid is an easy way to make sure it all breaks up.I'm less sure about the alternating. It is pretty common to alternate wet and dry as a way of getting things evenly mixed and avoiding lumps, so it's possible it's a variation on that. The paste might be too thick to easily mix into the wet, but also wet enough that it'd tend to stay as a lump if you mix it straight into the dry, so alternating wet-dry-paste might get you more even mixing? But if you're able to mix the paste smoothly into the wet, it's completely fine to just do that.  <sep>  Q: Why pre-mix baking soda into 2 tsp of milk? A: Mixing it with milk (or liquid in general) is probably just to remove clumps  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: it has to be added to the milk to form a tiny little bit of wet paste?

input: CONTEXT: You can neutralize the acidity of your drink by adding a half teaspoon of baking soda, but don't do this. Apart from fizzing up like a volcano, your lemon drink, or what is left of it, will taste pretty awful.What you want to do is reduce the perceived acidity. This can be done simply by adding more honey. I suggest adding a teaspoon at a time until it tastes about right.

Now complete the following example-
input: CONTEXT: From a cooking perspective any imitation sauce or marinade is never going to deliver the quality that venison has to deliver. We have a massive deer farm close and the price is still ridiculous .My suggestion is that you find a good butcher that will age beef for you on the bone ,or you could age it yourself if you have a climate control area to keep it at the correct temperature. Anything over 30 days on the bone will start to give you the gaming flavour you are craving. Nothing is going to match deer, but aged beef or really any type of cattle (eg buffalo etc) will give you the gaminess if it is aged. Restaurants are getting up to 180 days, which I could only imagine would melt in your mouth but the flavour would be intense.  <sep>  Q: How can I reproduce a ""gamey"" flavor?

The paste is ground so fine it will avoid the texture problems without any effort.The commonest flavours are mint or chilli, sometimes both together. Those get served with chopped onion, cucumber and tomato - or with papadoms/pappads.I find the most popular dipping versions result from the inclusion of a little mango chutney, Major Grey is good because it has ginger, too.  <sep>  Q: Do you know how to make a delicious yogurt sauce with yogurt/cream/mint/garlic?
