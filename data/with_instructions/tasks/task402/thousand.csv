answer type: Wine.
auxiliary information: Canada is a country, consisting of ten provinces and three territories, in the northern part of the continent of North America. It extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres in total, making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's common border with the United States forms the world's longest land border. The land now called Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the late 15th century, British and French colonies were established on the region's Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost North American territories until left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867, three colonies joined to form the autonomous federal Dominion of Canada. This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the new self-governing Dominion.

input: original question: What is the facility access of [Royal Montreal Golf Club]
answer: private
answer type: Golf Facility Access.
auxiliary information: 'The Royal Montreal Golf Club' is the oldest golf club in North America, founded 142 years ago in 1873. On the 4th day of November 1873, in the youthful but growing port city of Montreal, a small group of eight gentlemen sat in a dockside office and formed the Montreal Golf Club. This was the first effort to place golf on an organized basis, not only in Canada but in North America and it is, therefore, the oldest golf club in continuous existence on the continent. Eleven years later, in 1884, permission was granted by Queen Victoria to use the ""Royal"" prefix. The first golf course was a 9-hole layout on Fletcher's Field, part of Mount Royal Park, which was shared by the red-coated golfers and other citizens relaxing in what was then the outskirts of Montreal. The first female member, Mrs. William Wallis Watson, was elected in 1891 - the first woman of any golf club in North America. With her election, began the Ladies' Branch of the Royal Montreal Golf Club. In 1899, the Ladies moved into their own clubhouse at Dixie. In 1896, the club had moved to Dixie, in the parish of Dorval, where it remained until the pressures of urban growth again dictated a decision to move.

input: original question: Which softwares use the protocol of [User Datagram Protocol]?
answer: apple remote desktop, twisted
answer type: Software.
auxiliary information: The User Datagram Protocol is one of the core members of the Internet protocol suite. The protocol was designed by David P. Reed in 1980 and formally defined in RFC 768. UDP uses a simple connectionless transmission model with a minimum of protocol mechanism. It has no handshaking dialogues, and thus exposes any unreliability of the underlying network protocol to the user's program. There is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection. UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and port numbers for addressing different functions at the source and destination of the datagram. With UDP, computer applications can send messages, in this case referred to as datagrams, to other hosts on an Internet Protocol network without prior communications to set up special transmission channels or data paths. UDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction is either not necessary or is performed in the application, avoiding the overhead of such processing at the network interface level. Time-sensitive applications often use UDP because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for delayed packets, which may not be an option in a real-time system.

answer: radian per second
answer type: Unit of Angular Frequency.
auxiliary information: The International System of Units is the modern form of the metric system and is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both commerce and science. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. It defines twenty-two named units, and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram.

answer: volt
answer type: Unit of Potential.
auxiliary information: The International System of Units is the modern form of the metric system and is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both commerce and science. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. It defines twenty-two named units, and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram.

As a member of group 14 on the periodic table, it is nonmetallic and tetravalent‚Äîmaking four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. There are three naturally occurring isotopes, with ¬π¬≤C and ¬π¬≥C being stable, while ¬π‚Å¥C is radioactive, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity. There are several allotropes of carbon of which the best known are graphite, diamond, and amorphous carbon. The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, graphite is opaque and black, while diamond is highly transparent. Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper, while diamond is the hardest naturally-occurring material known. Graphite is a very good conductor, while diamond has a very low electrical conductivity. Under normal conditions, diamond, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials. All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form.

input: original question: Which constellation contains the galaxies [3C 279]?
answer: virgo
answer type: Constellation.
auxiliary information: 3C 279 is an optically violent variable quasar, which is known in the astronomical community for its variations in the visible, radio, and x-ray bands. The quasar was observed to have undergone a period of extreme activity from 1987 until 1991. The Rosemary Hill Observatory started observing 3C 279 in 1971, and was further observed by the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory in 1991, when it was unexpectedly discovered to be one of the brightest gamma ray objects in the sky. It is also one of the most bright and variable sources in the gamma ray sky monitored by the Fermi Space Telescope. Apparent superluminal motion was detected during observations first made in 1973 in a jet of material departing from the quasar, though it should be understood that this effect is an optical illusion caused by naive estimations of the speed, and no truly superluminal motion is occurring.

input: original question: Find telescope whose type is [Neutrino detector].
answer: icecube neutrino observatory
answer type: Telescope.
auxiliary information: A neutrino detector is a physics apparatus designed to study neutrinos. Because neutrinos only weakly interact with other particles of matter, neutrino detectors must be very large in order to detect a significant number of neutrinos. Neutrino detectors are often built underground, to isolate the detector from cosmic rays and other background radiation. The field of neutrino astronomy is still very much in its infancy ‚Äì the only confirmed extraterrestrial sources so far are the Sun and supernova SN1987A. Neutrino observatories will ""give astronomers fresh eyes with which to study the universe."" Various detection methods have been used. Super Kamiokande is a large volume of water surrounded by phototubes that watch for the Cherenkov radiation emitted when an incoming neutrino creates an electron or muon in the water. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory is similar, but uses heavy water as the detecting medium. Other detectors have consisted of large volumes of chlorine or gallium which are periodically checked for excesses of argon or germanium, respectively, which are created by neutrinos interacting with the original substance.

input: original question: Which product ingredient is a variety of [Sugar substitute]?
answer: glycerol
answer type: Product ingredient.
auxiliary information: A sugar substitute is a food additive that provides a sweet taste like that of sugar while containing significantly less food energy. Some sugar substitutes are natural and some are synthetic. Those that are not natural are, in general, called artificial sweeteners. An important class of sugar substitutes is known as high-intensity sweeteners. These are compounds with many times the sweetness of sucrose, common table sugar. As a result, much less sweetener is required and energy contribution is often negligible. The sensation of sweetness caused by these compounds is sometimes notably different from sucrose, so they are often used in complex mixtures that achieve the most natural sweet sensation. If the sucrose that is replaced has contributed to the texture of the product, then a bulking agent is often also needed. This may be seen in soft drinks or sweet tea that are labeled as ""diet"" or ""light"" that contain artificial sweeteners and often have notably different mouthfeel, or in table sugar replacements that mix maltodextrins with an intense sweetener to achieve satisfactory texture sensation.
output: ",[Sugar substitute] has a variety of what product ingredients?

answer: platinum, palladium, darmstadtium...
answer type: Chemical Element.
auxiliary information: Group 10, numbered by current IUPAC style, is the group of chemical elements in the periodic table that consists of nickel, palladium, platinum, and darmstadtium. All are d-block transition metals. All known isotopes of Ds are radioactive with short half-lives, and are not known to occur in nature; only minute quantities have been synthesized in laboratories. Like other groups, the members of this group show patterns in electron configuration, especially in the outermost shells, although for this group they are particularly weak, with palladium being an exceptional case. The relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital is the explanation to the predicted electron configuration of darmstadtium, which, unusually for this group, conforms to that predicted by the Aufbau principle.

answer: megahertz, gigahertz, hertz...
answer type: Unit of frequency.
auxiliary information: The International System of Units is the modern form of the metric system and is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both commerce and science. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. It defines twenty-two named units, and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram.

answer: suspension bridge
answer type: TV episode segment.
auxiliary information: American Gladiators is an American competition television program that aired weekly in syndication from September 1989 to May 1996. The series matched a cast of amateur athletes against each other, as well as against the show's own gladiators, in contests of strength and agility. The concept was created by Dan Carr and John C. Ferraro, who held the original competition at Erie Tech High School in Erie, Pennsylvania. They sold the show to The Samuel Goldwyn Company where the concept was enhanced and became American Gladiators. An effort in 2004 to launch a live American Gladiators show on the Las Vegas Strip became mired in a securities fraud prosecution. However, the television series was restarted in 2008. Episodes from the original series were played on ESPN Classic from 2007 to 2009. Several episodes are available for download on Apple's iTunes Service.

input: original question: Which religion's adherents are called [Hindu]?
answer: hinduism
answer type: Religion.
auxiliary information: Hindu can refer to either a religious or cultural identity associated with the philosophical, religious and cultural systems that are indigenous to the Indian subcontinent. In common use today, it refers to an adherent of Hinduism. However, in the Constitution of India, the word ""Hindu"" has been used in places to denote persons professing any religion originated in India. Further, the terms Hindu or Hindi are also used as a cultural identity to denote people living on the other side of the Indus river, thus poets like Iqbal, ministers like M.C.Chagla and organisations like the RSS used the terms Hindu and Hindi to represent any person living south and east of the Indus river, irrespective of religion. The word Hindu is derived from the Sanskrit word Sindhu, the historic local name for the Indus River in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. According to Gavin Flood, ""The actual term Hindu first occurs as a Persian geographical term for the people who lived beyond the river Indus"". The term Hindu then was a geographical term and did not refer to a religion.

input: original question: Which unit of capacitance is in the measurement system of [International System of Units]?
answer: farad
answer type: Unit of Capacitance.
auxiliary information: The International System of Units is the modern form of the metric system and is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both commerce and science. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. It defines twenty-two named units, and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram.

input: original question: Which measurement system use [Kilogram] as mass unit?
answer: international system of units
answer type: Measurement System.
auxiliary information: The kilogram or kilogramme, is the base unit of mass in the International System of Units and is defined as being equal to the mass of the International Prototype of the Kilogram. The gram, 1/1000th of a kilogram, was originally defined in 1795 as the mass of one cubic centimeter of water at the melting point of water. The original prototype kilogram, manufactured in 1799 and from which the IPK is derived, had a mass equal to the mass of 1.000025 liters of water at 4 ¬∞C. The kilogram is the only SI base unit with an SI prefix as part of its name. It is also the only SI unit that is still directly defined by an artifact rather than a fundamental physical property that can be reproduced in different laboratories. Three other base units in the SI system are defined relative to the kilogram, so its stability is important. The International Prototype Kilogram was commissioned by the General Conference on Weights and Measures under the authority of the Metre Convention, and is in the custody of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures who hold it on behalf of the CGPM.

John McCarthy, who coined the term in 1955, defines it as ""the science and engineering of making intelligent machines"". AI research is highly technical and specialized, and is deeply divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other. Some of the division is due to social and cultural factors: subfields have grown up around particular institutions and the work of individual researchers. AI research is also divided by several technical issues. Some subfields focus on the solution of specific problems. Others focus on one of several possible approaches or on the use of a particular tool or towards the accomplishment of particular applications.

answer: motor torpedo boat
answer type: Ship type.
auxiliary information: The Fairmile D motor torpedo boat was a type of British Motor Torpedo Boat designed by Bill Holt and conceived by Fairmile Marine for the Royal Navy. Nicknamed ""Dog Boats"", they were designed to combat the known advantages of the German E-boats over previous British coastal craft designs. They were bigger than earlier MTB or Motor Gun Boat designs but slower, at 30 knots compared to 40 knots. Unlike the Fairmile B designs, the Dog Boats were only produced in component form in Britain. Some were built for the RAF's Marine Branch for use in the long range air-sea rescue for downed airmen. 229 boats were built between 1942 and 1945. Many versions were produced or converted from existing boats; MGB, MTB, MA/SB, LRRC and post-war FPB. Since the Fairmile D could be fitted out with a mix of armament that gave it the capabilities of both a Motor Gun Boat and a Motor Torpedo boat, the MGB designation was dropped. Today the D-type is a popular choice among boat modelers. There are no known survivors, other than two abandoned wrecks, one in Chatham, England and the other in Ellings√∏y, Norway.

input: original question: Which unit of density use the measurement system of [Centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system of units]?
answer: gram per cubic centimetre
answer type: Unit of Density.
auxiliary information: The centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system of units is a variant of the metric system based on the centimetre as the unit of length, the gram as the unit of mass, and the second as the unit of time. All CGS mechanical units are unambiguously derived from these three base units, but there are several different ways of extending the CGS system to cover electromagnetism. The CGS system has been largely supplanted by the MKS system based on the metre, kilogram, and second, which was in turn extended and replaced by the International System of Units. In many fields of science and engineering, SI is the only system of units in use but there remain certain subfields where CGS is prevalent. In measurements of purely mechanical systems, the differences between CGS and SI are straightforward and rather trivial; the unit-conversion factors are all powers of 10 as 100 cm = 1 m and 1000 g = 1 kg. For example, the CGS unit of force is the dyne which is defined as 1 g¬∑cm/s¬≤, so the SI unit of force, the newton, is equal to 100,000 dynes. On the other hand, in measurements of electromagnetic phenomena, converting between CGS and SI is much more subtle and involved.

input: original question: What is the unit of radiant intensity in [International System of Units]?
answer: watt per steradian
answer type: Unit of Radiant Intensity.
auxiliary information: The International System of Units is the modern form of the metric system and is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both commerce and science. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. It defines twenty-two named units, and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram.

auxiliary information: The United States presidential election of 2012 was the 57th quadrennial presidential election. It was held on Tuesday, November 6, 2012. The Democratic nominee, incumbent President Barack Obama, and his running mate, Vice President Joe Biden, were elected to a second term, defeating the Republican nominee, former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney, and his running mate, Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. As the incumbent president, Obama secured the Democratic nomination with no serious opposition. The Republican Party was more fractured; Mitt Romney was consistently competitive in the polls, but faced challenges from a number of more conservative contenders whose popularity each fluctuated, often besting Romney's. Romney effectively secured the nomination by early May as the economy improved, albeit at a persistently laggard rate. The campaign was marked by a sharp rise in fundraising, including from new nominally independent Super PACs. The campaigns focused heavily on domestic issues: debate centered largely around sound responses to the Great Recession in terms of economic recovery and job creation.

input: original question: Which measurement system has the luminous flux units of [Lumen]?
answer: international system of units
answer type: Measurement System.
auxiliary information: The lumen is the SI derived unit of luminous flux, a measure of the total ""amount"" of visible light emitted by a source. Luminous flux differs from power in that luminous flux measurements reflect the varying sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths of light, while radiant flux measurements indicate the total power of all electromagnetic waves emitted, independent of the eye's ability to perceive it. Lumens are related to lux in that one lux is one lumen per square meter. The lumen is defined in relation to the candela as 1 lm = 1 cd‚ãÖsr. A full sphere has a solid angle of 4œÄ steradians, so a light source that uniformly radiates one candela in all directions has a total luminous flux of 1 cd √ó 4œÄ sr = 4œÄ cd‚ãÖsr ‚âà 12.57 lumens.

auxiliary information: Drag is used for any clothing carrying symbolic significance but usually referring to the clothing associated with one gender role when worn by a person of the other gender. The origins of the word are debated, but ""Drag"" has appeared in print as early as 1870. One suggested etymological root is 19th-century theatre slang, from the sensation of long skirts trailing on the floor. ""Drag queen"" appeared in print in 1941. The verb is to ""do drag"". A folk etymology whose acronym basis reveals the late-20th-century bias, would make ""drag"" an abbreviation of ""dressed as girl"" in description of male transvestism. The opposite, ""drab"" for ""dressed as boy"", is unrecorded. Drag is practiced by people of all sexual orientations and gender identities.

answer: btu per pound-mass per degree f
answer type: Unit of Specific Heat Capacity.
auxiliary information: United States customary units are a system of measurements commonly used in the United States. The U.S. customary system developed from English units which were in use in the British Empire before American independence. However, the British system of measures was overhauled in 1824 to create the Imperial system, changing the definitions of some units. Therefore, while many U.S. units are essentially similar to their Imperial counterparts, there are significant differences between the systems. The majority of U.S. customary units were redefined in terms of the meter and the kilogram with the Mendenhall Order of 1893 and, in practice, for many years before. These definitions were refined by the international yard and pound agreement of 1959. Americans primarily use customary units in commercial activities, as well as for personal and social use. In science, medicine, many sectors of industry and some of government, metric units are used. The International System of Units, the modern form of the metric system, is preferred for many uses by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology.

input: original question: which chemical compound's phase, at stp is [Liquid]?
answer: 2-methylhexane
answer type: Chemical Compound.
auxiliary information: A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a constant volume independent of pressure. As such, it is one of the four fundamental states of matter, and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container. Most liquids resist compression, although others can be compressed. Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. A distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena. The density of a liquid is usually close to that of a solid, and much higher than in a gas. Therefore, liquid and solid are both termed condensed matter. On the other hand, as liquids and gases share the ability to flow, they are both called fluids.

answer type: Coat of Arms.
auxiliary information: The current Emblem of France has been a symbol of France since 1953, although it does not have any legal status as an official coat of arms. It appears on the cover of French passports and was adopted originally by the French Foreign Ministry as a symbol for use by diplomatic and consular missions in 1912 using a design by the sculptor Jules-Cl√©ment Chaplain. In 1953, France received a request from the United Nations for a copy of the national coat of arms to be displayed alongside the coats of arms of other member states in its assembly chamber. An interministerial commission requested Robert Louis, heraldic artist, to produce a version of the Chaplain design. This did not, however, constitute an adoption of an official coat of arms by the Republic. It consists of: A wide shield with, on the one end a lion-head and on the other an eagle-head, bearing a monogram ""RF"" standing for R√©publique Fran√ßaise. A laurel branch symbolises victory of the Republic. An oak branch symbolises perennity or wisdom. The fasces, a symbol associated with the exercise of justice. This use of the fasces predates the adoption of this symbol by Benito Mussolini as the emblem of Italian Fascism.

answer: bit per second, kilobit per second, gigabit per second...
answer type: Unit of Data Transmission Rate.
auxiliary information: The International System of Units is the modern form of the metric system and is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both commerce and science. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. It defines twenty-two named units, and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram.

answer: joule per kelvin
answer type: Unit of Heat Capacity.
auxiliary information: The International System of Units is the modern form of the metric system and is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both commerce and science. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. It defines twenty-two named units, and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram.

input: original question: Find pistons that use [V12 engine]
answer: rolls-royce merlin, f133 engine
answer type: Piston engine.
auxiliary information: A V12 engine is a V engine with 12 cylinders mounted on the crankcase in two banks of six cylinders, usually but not always at a 60¬∞ angle to each other, with all 12 pistons driving a common crankshaft. Since each cylinder bank is essentially a straight-6 which is by itself in both primary and secondary balance, a V12 is automatically in primary and secondary balance no matter which V angle is used, and therefore it needs no balance shafts. A four-stroke 12 cylinder engine has an even firing order if cylinders fire every 60¬∞ of crankshaft rotation, so a V12 with cylinder banks at a multiples of 60¬∞ will have even firing intervals without using split crankpins. By using split crankpins or just ignoring minor vibrations, any V angle is possible. The 180¬∞ configuration is usually referred to as a Flat-twelve engine or even a boxer although it is in reality a 180¬∞ V since the pistons can and normally do use shared crankpins.

As of October 2014 this is the final and complete fifth revision of the HTML standard of the World Wide Web Consortium. The previous version, HTML 4, was standardized in 1997. Its core aims have been to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML. Following its immediate predecessors HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.1, HTML5 is a response to the fact that the HTML and XHTML in common use on the World Wide Web are a mixture of features introduced by various specifications, along with those introduced by software products such as web browsers, those established by common practice. It is also an attempt to define a single markup language that can be written in either HTML or XHTML.

input: original question: Which spaceport is launched in [Soyuz-2]?
answer: baikonur cosmodrome site 31
answer type: Spaceport.
auxiliary information: Soyuz-2, GRAU index 14A14, is the collective designation for the new version of the Russian Soyuz rocket. In its basic form, it is a three-stage carrier rocket for placing payloads into low Earth orbit. The first-stage boosters and two core stages feature uprated engines with improved injection systems, compared to the previous versions of the Soyuz. Digital flight control and telemetry systems allow the rocket to be launched from a fixed launch platform, whereas the launch platforms for earlier Soyuz rockets had to be rotated as the rocket could not perform a roll to change its heading in flight. Soyuz-2 is often flown with an upper stage, which allows it to lift payloads into higher orbits, such as Molniya and geosynchronous orbits. The upper stage is equipped with independent flight control and telemetry systems from those used in the rest of the rocket. The NPO Lavochkin manufactured Fregat is the most commonly used upper stage. Soyuz-2 rockets are currently launched from LC-31 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, and LC-43 at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, launch facilities shared with earlier R-7 derived rockets including the Soyuz-U and Molniya.

input: original question: Find writing systems with [Nabataean alphabet]
answer: syriac alphabet
answer type: Language Writing System.
auxiliary information: The Nabataean alphabet is a consonantal alphabet that was used by the Nabataeans in the 2nd century BC. Important inscriptions are found in Petra, Jordan. The alphabet is descended from the Syriac alphabet, which was itself descended from the Aramaic alphabet. In turn, a cursive form of Nabataean developed into the Arabic alphabet from the 4th century, which is why Nabataean's letterforms are intermediate between the more northerly Semitic scripts and those of Arabic. As compared to other Aramaic scripts, Nabataean developed more loops and ligatures, likely to increase speed of writing. The ligatures seem to have not been standardized and vary across time and space. There were no spaces between words. Numerals in Nabataean script were built from characters of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, and 100. Note that the Syriac and Arabic alphabets are always cursive and that some of their letters look differently in medial or initial position.

Clifford Shaw at RAND was first implemented, in beta form, on the JOHNNIAC computer in May 1963. The full implementation was deployed in January 1964, supporting five terminals and the final version, supporting ten terminals, was deployed in January 1965. JOSS was written in a symbolic assembly language called EasyFox. EasyFox was also developed by Cliff Shaw. JOSS was dubbed ""The Helpful Assistant"" and is renowned for its conversational user interface. Originally green/black typewriter ribbons were used in its terminals with green being used for user input and black for the computer's response. Any command that was not understood elicited the response ""Eh?"". JOSS II, was developed by Charles L. Baker, Joseph W. Smith, Irwin D. Greenwald, and G. Edward Bryan for the PDP-6 computer between 1964 and February 1966. Many variants of JOSS were developed and implemented on a variety of platforms. Some of these variants remained very similar to the original: TELCOMP, FOCAL, CAL, CITRAN, ISIS, PIL/I, JEAN, AID; while others, such as MUMPS, developed in distinctive directions.

input: original question: What geological formations are formed during [Cambrian]?
answer: nama group
answer type: Geological formation.
auxiliary information: The Cambrian is the first geological period of the Paleozoic Era, lasting from 541.0 ¬± 1.0 to 485.4 ¬± 1.9 million years ago and is succeeded by the Ordovician. Its subdivisions, and indeed its base, are somewhat in flux. The period was established by Adam Sedgwick, who named it after Cambria, the Latin name for Wales, where Britain's Cambrian rocks are best exposed. The Cambrian is unique in its unusually high proportion of lagerst√§tte sedimentary deposits. These are sites of exceptional preservation, where ""soft"" parts of organisms are preserved as well as their more resistant shells. This means that our understanding of the Cambrian biology surpasses that of some later periods. The Cambrian marked a profound change in life on Earth; prior to the Cambrian, the majority of living organisms on the whole were small, unicellular and simple; the Precambrian Charnia being exceptional. Complex, multicellular organisms gradually became more common in the millions of years immediately preceding the Cambrian, but it was not until this period that mineralized ‚Äì hence readily fossilized ‚Äì organisms became common.

auxiliary information: The House of Bourbon is a European royal house of French origin, a branch of the Capetian dynasty. Bourbon kings first ruled Navarre and France in the 16th century. By the 18th century, members of the Bourbon dynasty also held thrones in Spain, Naples, Sicily, and Parma. Spain and Luxembourg currently have Bourbon monarchs. The royal Bourbons originated in 1268, when the heiress of the lordship of Bourbon married a younger son of King Louis IX. The house continued for three centuries as a cadet branch, while more senior Capetians ruled France, until Henry IV became the first Bourbon king of France in 1589. Bourbon monarchs then unified France with the small kingdom of Navarre, which Henry's father had gained by marriage in 1555, and ruled until the 1792 overthrow of the monarchy during the French Revolution. Restored briefly in 1814 and definitively in 1815 after the fall of the First French Empire, the senior line of the Bourbons was finally overthrown in the July Revolution of 1830. A cadet branch, the House of Orl√©ans, then ruled for 18 years, until it too was overthrown.

auxiliary information: The Andromeda Galaxy is a spiral galaxy approximately 780 kiloparsecs from Earth. Also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224, it is often referred to as the Great Andromeda Nebula in older texts. The Andromeda Galaxy is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way. It gets its name from the area of the sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which was named after the mythological princess Andromeda. The Andromeda Galaxy is the largest galaxy of the Local Group, which also contains the Milky Way, the Triangulum Galaxy, and about 44 other smaller galaxies. The Andromeda Galaxy is the most massive galaxy in the Local Group as well. Despite earlier findings that suggested that the Milky Way contains more dark matter and could be the most massive in the grouping, the 2006 observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope revealed that Andromeda contains one trillion stars: at least twice the number of stars in the Milky Way, which is estimated to be 200‚Äì400 billion. The Andromeda Galaxy is estimated to be 1.5√ó10^ solar masses, while the mass of the Milky Way is estimated to be 8.5√ó10^ solar masses.

input: original question: Which organism classification has the latest fossil record of [Pleistocene]?
answer: mesotheriidae
answer type: Organism Classification.
auxiliary information: The Pleistocene /Ààpla…™st…µsiÀên/ is the geological epoch which lasted from about 2,588,000 to 11,700 years ago, spanning the world's recent period of repeated glaciations. Charles Lyell introduced this term in 1839 to describe strata in Sicily that had at least 70% of their molluscan fauna still living today. This distinguished it from the older Pliocene Epoch, which Lyell had originally thought to be the youngest fossil rock layer. He constructed the name ""Pleistocene"" from the Greek œÄŒªŒµ·øñœÉœÑŒøœÇ, pleƒ´stos, ""most"", and Œ∫Œ±ŒπŒΩœåœÇ, kain√≥s, ""new""; this contrasting with the immediately preceding Pleiocene, and the immediately subsequent Holocene epoch, which extends to the present time. The Pleistocene is the first epoch of the Quaternary Period or sixth epoch of the Cenozoic Era. The end of the Pleistocene corresponds with the end of the last glacial period. It also corresponds with the end of the Paleolithic age used in archaeology. In the ICS timescale, the Pleistocene is divided into four stages or ages, the Gelasian, Calabrian, Ionian and Tarantian. All of these stages were defined in southern Europe.

According to the Scotch Whisky Association's 2013 annual report, unlike the European Union, ""there is no compulsory definition of whisky in India, and the Indian voluntary standard does not require whisky to be distilled from cereals or to be matured. Very little Indian 'whisky' qualifies as whisky in the EU owing to the use of molasses or neutral alcohol, limited maturation and the use of flavourings. Such spirits are, of course, considerably cheaper to produce than genuine whisky."" Ninety percent of the whisky consumed in India is molasses-based, although whisky wholly distilled from malt and other grains, is also manufactured and sold.

answer: fourth generation ford thunderbird
answer type: Automobile generation.
auxiliary information: The fifth generation of the Ford Thunderbird is a large personal luxury car that was produced by Ford for the 1967 to 1971 model years. This fifth generation saw the second major change of direction for the Thunderbird. The Thunderbird had fundamentally remained the same in concept through 1966, even though the styling had been updated twice. The introduction of the Ford Mustang in early 1964 had, however, challenged the Thunderbird's market positioning. It, like the Thunderbird, was a small, two-door, four-seater with sporting pretensions, but it was substantially cheaper. The Thunderbird's sales suffered. Ford's response was to move the Thunderbird upmarket. For 1967 the Thunderbird would be a larger car, moving it closer to Lincoln as the company chose to emphasize the ""luxury"" part of the ""personal luxury car"" designation. Ford chose to abandon the Thunderbird's traditional unibody construction for this larger car, turning to a body-on-frame method with sophisticated rubber mountings between the two to reduce vibration and noise.

input: original question: What is the gender of [Columbina]?
answer: female
answer type: Character Gender.
auxiliary information: Colombina is a stock character in the Commedia dell'Arte. She is Harlequin's mistress, a comic servant playing the tricky slave type and wife of Pierrot. Rudlin and Crick use the Italian spelling Colombina in Commedia dell'arte: A Handbook for Troupes. She is dressed in a ragged and patched dress, appropriate to a hired servant. Occasionally, under the name Arlecchina she would wear a motley, similar to her counterpart Arlecchino. She was also known to wear heavy makeup around her eyes and carry a tambourine, which she could use to fend off the amorous advances of Pantalone. She was often the only functional intellect on the stage. Columbina aided her mistress, the innamorata, to gain the affections of her one true love, by manipulating Arlecchino and counter-plotting against Pantalone, while simultaneously managing the whereabouts of the innamorato. She may be a flirtatious and impudent character, indeed a soubrette but without losing her judgment. In the verismo opera Pagliacci by Ruggero Leoncavallo, the head troup's wife, Nedda, plays as Colombina, cheating on her husband, onstage with Arlecchino and offstage with Silvio.
output: ",Is [Columbina] a male or female?

answer: automatic transmission
answer type: Transmission Classification.
auxiliary information: The Ford C4 is a three-speed, medium-duty automatic transmission introduced on 1964 model year vehicles and produced through 1981. The C4 was designed to be a lighter and more simple replacement for the original Ford-O-Matic two speed transmission being used in smaller, less powerful cars. Because of its cast iron construction, the Ford-O-Matic was very heavy. In designing the C4, Ford used an aluminum alloy, three-piece case. The aluminum case and the use of a more simple Simpson planetary gearset reduced the weight significantly. It was primarily used with Ford's inline six-cylinder engines and small V8 engines, usually up to 302 in¬≥. By comparison, the 351 Windsor and 351 Cleveland small and intermediate-block engines were backed by the medium-duty FMX or the heavy-duty C6 that debuted in 1966. Some C4s were built with a larger spread bell housing to use with 351M V8s, but these are rare. A few were also used with FE engines, mostly the 390. in full-size cars. The early model C4 used a .788-inch 24-spline input shaft, which was upgraded in 1970 to 26-spline and .839-inch. The upgrade also included a matching clutch hub of 26-spline.

answer type: Telescope type.
auxiliary information: A reflecting telescope is an optical telescope which uses a single or combination of curved mirrors that reflect light and form an image. The reflecting telescope was invented in the 17th century as an alternative to the refracting telescope which, at that time, was a design that suffered from severe chromatic aberration. Although reflecting telescopes produce other types of optical aberrations, it is a design that allows for very large diameter objectives. Almost all of the major telescopes used in astronomy research are reflectors. Reflecting telescopes come in many design variations and may employ extra optical elements to improve image quality or place the image in a mechanically advantageous position. Since reflecting telescopes use mirrors, the design is sometimes referred to as a ""catoptric"" telescope.

answer type: Disaster.
auxiliary information: The Brown Building is a ten-story building that is part of the campus of New York University. It is located at 23-29 Washington Place, between Greene Street and Washington Square East in Greenwich Village, New York City. It was built in 1900‚Äì01, designed by John Woolley in the neo-Renaissance style. It was originally named the Asch Building after its owner, Joseph J. Asch. The top three floors of the building were at one time occupied by the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, which was the site of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire that killed 146 garment workers on March 25, 1911. The fire led to wide-ranging legislation requiring improved factory safety standards and helped spur the growth of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. The building survived the fire and was refurbished. Three plaques on the southeast corner of the building commemorate the men and women who lost their lives in the fire. NYU began to use the eighth floor of the building for a library and classrooms in 1916. Real estate speculator and philanthropist Frederick Brown later bought the building and subsequently donated it to the university in 1929, where it was renamed as the Brown Building.

answer: lumen
answer type: Unit of Luminous Flux.
auxiliary information: The International System of Units is the modern form of the metric system and is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both commerce and science. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. It defines twenty-two named units, and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram.

input: original question: Which TV program origins from [Ivory Coast]
answer: ma famille
answer type: TV Program.
auxiliary information: Ivory Coast or C√¥te d'Ivoire, officially the Republic of C√¥te d'Ivoire, is a country in West Africa. Ivory Coast's de jure capital is Yamoussoukro and its biggest city is the port of Abidjan. Prior to its colonization by Europeans, Ivory Coast was home to several states, including Gyaaman, the Kong Empire, and Baoul√©. There were two Anyi kingdoms, Ind√©ni√© and Sanwi, which attempted to retain their separate identity through the French colonial period and after independence. Ivory Coast became a protectorate of France in 1843‚Äì44 and was later formed into a French colony in 1893 amid the European scramble for Africa. Ivory Coast achieved independence in 1960, led by F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny, who ruled the country until 1993. It maintained close political and economic association with its West African neighbours, while at the same time maintaining close ties to the West, especially France. Since the end of Houphou√´t-Boigny's rule in 1993, Ivory Coast has experienced one coup d'√©tat, in 1999, and two religiously-grounded civil wars: the first taking place between 2002 and 2007, and the second during 2010-2011.

input: original question: What's the unit of wavenumber in the measurement system [International System of Units]?
answer: reciprocal metre
answer type: Unit of Wavenumber.
auxiliary information: The International System of Units is the modern form of the metric system and is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both commerce and science. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. It defines twenty-two named units, and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram.

Therefore a player has to run less distance when forced to move towards the ball.  2. A one-handed backhand also allows doesn't force the player to still really deep when hitting a ball 3. Generally a one-handed backhand allows for more touch when hitting the ball 4. Hitting slice backhands is also easier when hit one-handed. Double handed slice is a tough shot which often misses the needed touch. 5. It's easier to switch from full swing to slice when the backhand is hit one-handed. Players like Nadel of Djokovic have mastered this skill but it doesn't come naturally  6. From an esthetic point of view a one-handed backhand is considered a beautiful shot, regardsless of its effectiveness  Downside of playing a one-handed backhand is the need for excellent timing and precision. If done correctly the one-handed backhand is a fierce shot with great pace. Maximum relaxation in the hitting arm is required. With a double handed backhand there is more room for correction. It often allows players to become more solid in rallyplay.

auxiliary information: Asteroids are minor planets, especially those of the inner Solar System. The larger ones have also been called planetoids. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not show the disc of a planet and was not observed to have the characteristics of an active comet. As minor planets in the outer Solar System were discovered and found to have volatile-based surfaces that resemble those of comets, they were often distinguished from asteroids of the asteroid belt. In this article, the term ""asteroid"" is restricted to the minor planets of the inner Solar System or co-orbital with Jupiter. There are millions of asteroids, many thought to be the shattered remnants of planetesimals, bodies within the young Sun's solar nebula that never grew large enough to become planets. The large majority of known asteroids orbit in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, or are co-orbital with Jupiter. However, other orbital families exist with significant populations, including the near-Earth asteroids.

input: original question: what culinary tool is used in [Cajun Roux]?
answer: wooden spoon, cast iron skillet
answer type: Culinary tool.
auxiliary information: Pronounced ""roo"", Roux is traditionally an equal blend of Flour and Oil.  Used as the base for many Cajun and Creole recipes. Heat the oil in a large cast iron skillet on medium. Beginners should start on medium low until you're successful with not burning it and creating small pieces of black bits of flour, yuck! Once the oil is hot, add flour and begin stirring slowly and constantly since Roux has a tendancy to burn quickly. (some smoke is normal since you are technically slowly burning and darkening the flour with hot oil) Never stop stirring. If the Cajun Roux sits in one spot for too long, it will burn. If your roux burns, toss it out and start over. A light roux should be the color of a Manila Folder with a slight brownish tint beyond the white color of flour. A dark roux (Traditional) should be the color of saddle leather brown, which can take up to 20 mins.

input: original question: Which game has the genre of [Board game]?
answer: three men's morris, 7 wonders, poleconomy...
answer type: Game.
auxiliary information: A board game is a game that involves counters or pieces moved or placed on a pre-marked surface or ""board"", according to a set of rules. Games can be based on pure strategy, chance, or a mixture of the two, and usually have a goal that a player aims to achieve. Early board games represented a battle between two armies, and most modern board games are still based on defeating opposing players in terms of counters, winning position, or accrual of points. There are many varieties of board games. Their representation of real-life situations can range from having no inherent theme, to having a specific theme and narrative. Rules can range from the very simple, to those describing a game universe in great detail ‚Äì although most of the latter are role-playing games where the board is secondary to the game, serving to help visualize the game scenario. The time required to learn to play or master a game varies greatly from game to game. Learning time does not necessarily correlate with the number or complexity of rules; some games having profound strategies possess relatively simple rulesets.
output: ",[Board game] is the same genre of which game?

answer: joule per mole per kelvin
answer type: Unit of Molar Heat Capacity.
auxiliary information: The International System of Units is the modern form of the metric system and is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both commerce and science. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. It defines twenty-two named units, and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram.

answer: engineered language

auxiliary information: Lojban is a constructed, syntactically unambiguous human language based on predicate logic, succeeding the Loglan project. The name ""Lojban"" is a compound formed from loj and ban, which are short forms of logji and bangu. The Logical Language Group began developing Lojban in 1987. The LLG sought to realize Loglan's purposes, and further improve the language by making it more usable and freely available. After a long initial period of debating and testing, the baseline was completed in 1997, and published as The Complete Lojban Language. In an interview in 2010 with the New York Times, Arika Okrent, the author of In the Land of Invented Languages, stated: ""The constructed language with the most complete grammar is probably Lojban‚Äîa language created to reflect the principles of logic."" Lojban was developed to be a worldlang; to ensure that the gismu of the language sound familiar to people from diverse linguistic backgrounds, they were based on the six most widely spoken languages as of 1987‚ÄîMandarin, English, Hindi, Spanish, Russian, and Arabic. Lojban has also taken components from other constructed languages, notably the set of evidential indicators from L√°adan.

answer: cassini‚äìhuygens
answer type: Space Mission.
auxiliary information: Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. Although only one-eighth the average density of Earth, with its larger volume Saturn is just over 95 times more massive. Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture, its astronomical symbol represents the god's sickle. Saturn's interior is probably composed of a core of iron‚Äìnickel and rock. This core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally outside the Frenkel line a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth the strength of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear.

answer: present laughter, present laughter, present laughter...
answer type: Theater Production.
auxiliary information: Present Laughter is a comic play written by No√´l Coward in 1939 and first staged in 1942 on tour, alternating with his lower middle-class domestic drama This Happy Breed. Later Coward's new play Blithe Spirit was added to the repertory for the tour. The play's title comes from a song in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, which urges carpe diem, and so the word present in the title should be pronounced as the adjective, not the verb. The plot follows a few days in the life of the successful and self-obsessed light comedy actor Garry Essendine as he prepares to travel for a touring commitment in Africa. Amid a series of events bordering on farce, Garry has to deal with women who want to seduce him, placate both his long-suffering secretary and his estranged wife, cope with a crazed young playwright, and overcome his impending mid-life crisis. The story was described by Coward as ""a series of semi-autobiographical pyrotechnics"". Coward starred as Garry Essendine in Present Laughter during the original run. Later productions have featured actors such as Nigel Patrick, Albert Finney, Peter O'Toole, Simon Callow and Ian McKellen in the lead role.

auxiliary information: Neisseria meningitidis, often referred to as meningococcus, is a gram negative bacterium that can cause meningitis and other forms of meningococcal disease such as meningococcemia, a life-threatening sepsis. The bacterium is referred to as a coccus because it is round, and more specifically, diplococcus because of its tendency to form pairs. About 10% of adults are carrier of the bacteria in their nasopharynx. As an exclusively human pathogen it is the main cause of bacterial meningitis in children and young adults, causing developmental impairment and death in about 10% of cases. It causes the only form of bacterial meningitis known to occur epidemically, mainly in Africa and Asia. N. meningitidis is spread through saliva and respiratory secretions during coughing, sneezing, kissing, and chewing on toys. It infects the cell by sticking to it with long thin extensions called pili and the surface-exposed proteins Opa and Opc and has several virulence factors.

input: original question: Which measurement system uses [Newton metre] as the moment of force unit?
answer: international system of units
answer type: Measurement System.
auxiliary information: The newton metre is a unit of torque in the SI system. The symbolic form is N m or N¬∑m. One newton metre, sometimes hyphenated newton-metre, is equal to the torque resulting from a force of one newton applied perpendicularly to a moment arm which is one metre long. It is also used less commonly as a unit of work, or energy, in which case it is equivalent to the more common and standard SI unit of energy, the joule. In this very different usage the metre term represents the distance travelled or displacement in the direction of the force, and not the perpendicular distance from a fulcrum as it does when used to express torque. This usage is discouraged by the SI authority, since it can lead to confusion as to whether a given quantity expressed in newton metres is a torque or a quantity of energy. However, since torque represents energy transferred or expended per angle of revolution, one newton metre of torque is equivalent to one joule per radian. Newton metres and joules are ""dimensionally equivalent"" in the sense that they have the same expression in SI base units:

auxiliary information: Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the ""Red Planet"" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the volcanoes, valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. The rotational period and seasonal cycles of Mars are likewise similar to those of Earth, as is the tilt that produces the seasons. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and second-highest known mountain in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan. Until the first successful Mars flyby in 1965 by Mariner 4, many speculated about the presence of liquid water on the planet's surface.

answer: clock, water clock, cuckoo clock...
answer type: Measuring Instrument.
auxiliary information: Time is a measure in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future, and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions. Time has long been a major subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science, but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars. Nevertheless, diverse fields such as business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the performing arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring systems. Some simple definitions of time include ""time is what clocks measure"", which is a problematically vague and self-referential definition that utilizes the device used to measure the subject as the definition of the subject, and ""time is what keeps everything from happening at once"", which is without substantive meaning in the absence of the definition of simultaneity in the context of the limitations of human sensation, observation of events, and the perception of such events. Two contrasting viewpoints on time divide many prominent philosophers.

The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram.

auxiliary information: The National Register of Historic Places is the United States federal government's official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects deemed worthy of preservation. A property listed in the National Register, or located within a National Register Historic District, may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred preserving the property. The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it. Of the more than one million properties on the National Register, 80,000 are listed individually. The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts. Each year approximately 30,000 properties are added to the National Register as part of districts or by individual listings. For most of its history the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service, an agency within the United States Department of the Interior. Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups, such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation, coordinate, identify, and protect historic sites in the United States.

input: original question: [Tidal locking] is a type of which orbital relationship?
answer: moon
answer type: Orbital Relationship.
auxiliary information: Tidal locking occurs when the gravitational gradient makes one side of an astronomical body always face another, an effect known as synchronous rotation. For example, the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth. A tidally locked body takes just as long to rotate around its own axis as it does to revolve around its partner. This causes one hemisphere constantly to face the partner body. Usually, at any given time only the satellite is tidally locked around the larger body, but if the difference in mass between the two bodies and their physical separation is small, each may be tidally locked to the other, as is the case between Pluto and Charon. This effect is employed to stabilize some artificial satellites.

input: original question: Which poem character appears in [A Supermarket in California]?
answer: federico garc√≠a lorca, walt whitman
answer type: Poem character.
auxiliary information: ""A Supermarket in California"" is a poem by American poet Allen Ginsberg first published in Howl and Other Poems in 1956. In the poem, the narrator imagines visiting a supermarket in California where he finds Federico Garc√≠a Lorca and Walt Whitman shopping. Whitman, who is also discussed in ""Howl"", is a character common in Ginsberg's poems, and is often referred to as Ginsberg's poetic model. ""A Supermarket in California"", written in Berkeley and published in 1956, was intended to be a tribute to Whitman in the centennial year of the first edition of Leaves of Grass. For its critique of mainstream American culture, the poem is considered to be one of the major works of the Beat Generation, which included other authors of the era such as Jack Kerouac, William Seward Burroughs, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Ginsberg achieved critical success in 1956 with the publication of Howl and Other Poems, with ""Howl"" being the most popular of the works in the collection. Like ""Howl"", ""A Supermarket in California"" was a critique of postwar America, yet in the poem the narrator focuses more on consumerist aspects of society by contrasting his generation with Whitman's.

input: original question: Which satellite is primary used for [Communications satellite]
answer: tdrs-k, palapa-d, indostar-1...
answer type: Satellite.
auxiliary information: A communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies certain telecommunications signals, acting as a middleman between a source and a receiver. These satellites are used for television, telephone, radio, internet, and military applications. As of May 11, 2015, there are over 2,000 communications satellites in Earth‚Äôs orbit, used by both private and government organizations. Wireless communication uses electromagnetic waves to carry signals. These waves require line-of-sight, and are thus obstructed by the curvature of the Earth. In order to communicate over great distances, satellites are used to redirect the signal. There are two major classes of communications satellites. The first class is called the ‚Äúpassive satellite‚Äù. This type of satellite only redirects the signal coming from the source, and points in the direction of the receiver. With passive satellites, the transmitting signal has the tendency to be weak. This is because, as the electromagnetic wave moves through the atmosphere, particles will interrupt the wave and cause it to be muffled. Active satellites, on the other hand, allow for a signal that is much more clear.

answer: environmental insurance
answer type: Product line.
auxiliary information: Insurance is the equitable transfer of the risk of a loss, from one entity to another in exchange for money. It is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent, uncertain loss. An insurer, or insurance carrier, is selling the insurance; the insured, or policyholder, is the person or entity buying the insurance policy. The amount of money to be charged for a certain amount of insurance coverage is called the premium. Risk management, the practice of appraising and controlling risk, has evolved as a discrete field of study and practice. The transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively small loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer's promise to compensate the insured in the case of a financial loss. The insured receives a contract, called the insurance policy, which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insured will be financially compensated.

input: original question: Which fictional character's species is [Elephant]?
answer: elephant prissy, dumbo, great granny wrinkle...
answer type: Fictional Character.
auxiliary information: Elephants are large land mammals in two extant genera of the family Elephantidae: Elephas and Loxodonta, with the third genus Mammuthus extinct. Three species of elephant are recognized: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant and the Indian or Asian elephant] although some group the two African species into one and some researchers also postulate the existence of a fourth species in West Africa. All other species and genera of Elephantidae are extinct. Most have been extinct since the last ice age, although dwarf forms of mammoths might have survived as late as 2,000 BCE. Elephants and other Elephantidae were once classified with other thick-skinned animals in a now invalid order, Pachydermata. Elephants are the largest living land animals on Earth today. The elephant's gestation period is 22 months, the longest of any land animal. At birth, an elephant calf typically weighs 105 kilograms (230 lb). They typically live for 50 to 70 years, but the oldest recorded elephant lived for 82 years. The largest elephant ever recorded was shot in Angola in 1955. This male weighed about 10,900 kg (24,000 lb), with a shoulder height of 3.96 metres (13.0 ft), 1 metre (3.3 ft) taller than the average male African elephant. The smallest elephants, about the size of a calf or a large pig, were a prehistoric species that lived on the island of Crete during the Pleistocene epoch. Elephants are a symbol of wisdom in Asian cultures and are famed for their memory and intelligence, where their intelligence level is thought to be equal to that of dolphins and primates. Aristotle once said the elephant was ""the beast which passeth all others in wit and mind."" The word ""elephant"" has its origins in the Greek ·ºêŒªŒ≠œÜŒ±œÇ, meaning ""ivory"" or ""elephant"". Healthy adult elephants have no natural predators, although lions may take calves or weak individuals. They are, however, threatened by human intrusion and poaching.

answer: siemens per meter, microsiemens per centimeter
answer type: Unit of Conductivity.
auxiliary information: The International System of Units is the modern form of the metric system and is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both commerce and science. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. It defines twenty-two named units, and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram.

answer: remus, s/2003 j 16, prospero...
answer type: Celestial Object.
auxiliary information: A natural satellite or moon is a celestial body that orbits another body, which is called its primary, and that is not artificial. In the Solar System there are 173 known natural satellites orbiting within 6 planetary satellite systems. In addition, several other planetary-mass objects are known to have satellite systems, including those of the IAU-listed dwarf planets, the moons of Pluto, Haumea and the Eris‚ÄìDysnomia systems. As of January 2012, over 200 minor-planet moons have been discovered. There are 76 known objects in the asteroid belt with satellites, four Jupiter trojans, 39 near-Earth objects, and 14 Mars-crossers. There are also 84 known natural satellites of trans-Neptunian objects. Some 150 additional small bodies have been observed within the rings of Saturn, but only a few were tracked long enough to establish orbits. Planets around other stars are likely to have satellites as well, and although numerous candidates have been detected to date, none have yet been confirmed. Of the inner planets, Mercury and Venus have no natural satellites; Earth has one large natural satellite, known as the Moon; and Mars has two tiny natural satellites, Phobos and Deimos.

input: original question: What is the orbit type of [Pluto]
answer: heliocentric orbit
answer type: Orbit Type.
auxiliary information: Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond Neptune. It was the first Kuiper belt object to be discovered. It is the largest and second-most-massive known dwarf planet in the Solar System and the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the Sun. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume but is less massive than Eris, a dwarf planet in the scattered disc. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small‚Äîabout one-sixth the mass of the Moon and one-third its volume. It has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 30 to 49 astronomical units or AU from the Sun. This means that Pluto periodically comes closer to the Sun than Neptune, but a stable orbital resonance with Neptune prevents them from colliding. In 2014, Pluto was 32.6 AU from the Sun. Light from the Sun takes about 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its average distance. Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh, and was originally considered the ninth planet from the Sun.

answer: palestine
answer type: Fictional Setting.
auxiliary information: In William Blake's mythology, Beulah, originally Hebrew ◊ë÷∞÷º◊¢◊ï÷º◊ú÷∏◊î is ""the realm of the Subconscious, the source of poetic inspiration and of dreams."" It is also, according to Blake scholar Alexander S. Gourlay, ""a dreamy paradise where the sexes, though divided, blissfully converse in shameless selflessness. Beulah is available through dreams and visions to those in Ulro, the utterly fallen world."" Between Eternity and Ulro, it is imagined as a place without conflict similar to a conventional image of heaven or Eternity. However, for Blake, the idea of an everlasting peaceful Eternity is misguided and fallen.

answer: chicago midway international airport
answer type: Airport.
auxiliary information: Midway Airlines was a United States airline founded on October 13, 1976, by investor Irving T. Tague. Although it received its operating certificate from the Civil Aeronautics Board prior to the passage of the Airline Deregulation Act in 1978, it is widely recognized as the first post-deregulation start-up. The airline commenced operations in 1979. The airline was intended to breathe new life into Chicago Midway International Airport, then called Chicago Midway Airport, which had lost most of its scheduled flights to O'Hare International Airport. Midway Airlines and the revitalized airport were advertised as a trouble-free alternative to O'Hare, and both of these spurred re-development and growth on Chicago's South Side. The airport was billed as a convenient ten- to fifteen-minute drive from downtown Chicago.

input: original question: What's the position of [Volleyball]?
answer: receiver
answer type: Sports position.
auxiliary information: Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules. It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since 1964. The complete rules are extensive. But simply, play proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball, from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court. The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. The team may touch the ball up to 3 times but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively. Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack, an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court. The rally continues, with each team allowed as many as three consecutive touches, until either: a team makes a kill, grounding the ball on the opponent's court and winning the rally; or: a team commits a fault and loses the rally.

answer type: Sports League Draft.
auxiliary information: Major League Baseball is a professional baseball organization that is the oldest of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. A total of 30 teams now play in the American League and National League, which operated as separate legal entities from 1901 and 1876 respectively. In 2000, the leagues merged into a single organization led by the Commissioner of Baseball. The organization also oversees minor league baseball leagues, which comprise about 240 teams affiliated with the major-league clubs. With the World Baseball Softball Confederation, the league manages the international World Baseball Classic tournament. Baseball's first professional team was founded in Cincinnati in 1869. The first few decades of professional baseball were characterized by rivalries between leagues and by players who often jumped from one team or league to another. The period before 1920 in baseball was known as the dead-ball era; players rarely hit home runs during this time. Baseball survived a game-throwing incident known as the Black Sox Scandal in the 1919 World Series.

input: original question: Which type of planetographic feature of [Pedestal crater]
answer: impact crater
answer type: Type of planetographic feature.
auxiliary information: In planetary geology, a pedestal crater is a crater with its ejecta sitting above the surrounding terrain and thereby forming a raised platform. They form when an impact crater ejects material which forms an erosion-resistant layer, thus causing the immediate area to erode more slowly than the rest of the region. Some pedestals have been accurately measured to be hundreds of meters above the surrounding area. This means that hundreds of meters of material were eroded away. The result is that both the crater and its ejecta blanket stand above the surroundings. Pedestal craters were first observed during the Mariner missions. With further study, researchers have divided related craters into three different classes. and have advanced ideas about how they were formed. Excess ejecta craters and perched craters are larger than pedestal craters. All three have similar shapes with the bowl of the crater and an area around the bowl sitting above the surrounding surface. Excess ejecta craters and perched craters show ejecta deposits, but pedestal craters usually do not.

input: original question: In which measurement system, the amount of substance unit is [Mole]?
answer: international system of units
answer type: Measurement System.
auxiliary information: The mole is a unit of measurement for amount of substance. It is defined as the amount of any chemical substance that contains as many elementary entities, e.g., atoms, molecules, ions, or electrons, as there are atoms in 12 grams of pure carbon-12, the isotope of carbon with relative atomic mass 12 by definition. This number is expressed by the Avogadro constant, which has a value of 6.02214129√ó10^. It is one of the base units in the International System of Units; it has the unit symbol mol. The mole is widely used in chemistry as a convenient way to express amounts of reactants and products of chemical reactions. For example, the chemical equation 2 H‚ÇÇ + O‚ÇÇ ‚Üí 2 H‚ÇÇO implies that 2 mol of dihydrogen and 1 mol of dioxygen react to form 2 mol of water. The mole may also be used to express the number of atoms, ions, or other elementary entities in a given sample of any substance. The concentration of a solution is commonly expressed by its molarity, defined as the number of moles of the dissolved substance per litre of solution.

input: original question: Which product line use [Black] theme?
answer: lace closures
answer type: Product line.
auxiliary information: Black people is a term used in certain countries, often in socially based systems of racial classification or of ethnicity, to describe persons who are perceived to be dark-skinned compared to other given populations. As such, the meaning of the expression varies widely both between and within societies, and depends significantly on context. For many other individuals, communities and countries, ""black"" is also perceived as a derogatory, outdated, reductive or otherwise unrepresentative label, and as a result is neither used nor defined. Different societies, such as Australia, Brazil, the United Kingdom, the United States and South Africa, apply differing criteria regarding who is classified as ""black"", and these social constructs have also changed over time. In a number of countries, societal variables affect classification as much as skin color, and the social criteria for ""blackness"" vary. For example, in North America the term black people is not necessarily an indicator of skin color or ethnic origin but is instead a socially based racial classification related to being African American, with a family history associated with institutionalized slavery.

input: original question: Which sports league season has the championship event of [1979 World Series] ?
answer: 1979 major league baseball season
answer type: Sports League Season.
auxiliary information: The 1979 World Series matched the National League's Pittsburgh Pirates against the American League's Baltimore Orioles, with the Pirates coming back from a three games to one deficit to win the Series in seven games. The Pirates were famous for adopting Sister Sledge's hit anthem ""We Are Family"" as their theme song. Willie Stargell, pitcher Bruce Kison, and catcher Manny Sanguill√©n were the only players left over from the Pirates team that last faced the Orioles in the 1971 World Series, and Orioles' pitcher Jim Palmer, Mark Belanger, and manager Earl Weaver were the only ones who were still with the team that faced the Pirates in that same previous meeting. Grant Jackson pitched for the Orioles in the 1971 series and for the Pirates in the 1979 series. In this Series, it was the American League team's ""turn"" to play by National League rules, meaning no designated hitter and the Orioles' pitchers would have to bat. While this resulted in Tim Stoddard getting his first major league hit and RBI in Game 4, overall, it hurt the Orioles because Lee May, their designated hitter for much of the season and a key part of their offense, was only able to bat three times in the whole series.

answer: appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e
answer type: Cheese certification.
auxiliary information: Abondance is a semi-hard, fragrant, raw-milk cheese made in the Haute-Savoie department of France. Its name comes from a small commune also called Abondance. A round of Abondance weighs approximately 10 kg and its aroma is similar to that of Beaufort, also from France. Abondance is made exclusively from milk produced by the Abondance; montb√©liarde and tarine breed of cattle. By 2022, the herd producing the milk for Abondance cheese will need to be constituted of a minimum of 55% of the herd. In 1998, 873 tonnes were produced, 34% from local farms. Abondance cheese was granted an Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e or AOC in 1990. The region has been known for its cheese since at least the 14th century when monks from the Sainte Marie d'Abondance Monastery are recorded to have supplied cheese to the papal conclave at Avignon. Abondance cheese can be either artisanal or farm-made; it is now made exclusively in the area of Abondance in Chablais, Haute-Savoie. The ageing period for Abondance is a minimum of three months on specially-prepared spruce boards.

auxiliary information: The Arms of Canada, also known as the Royal Coat of Arms of Canada or formally as the Arms of Her Majesty The Queen in Right of Canada, is, since 1921, the official coat of arms of the Canadian monarch and thus also of Canada. It is closely modelled after the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom with distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British. The maple leaves in the shield, blazoned ""proper"", were originally drawn vert but were redrawn gules in 1957 and a circlet of the Order of Canada was added to the arms for limited use in 1987. The shield design forms the monarch's royal standard and is also found on the Canadian Red Ensign. The Flag of the Governor General of Canada, which formerly used the shield over the Union Flag, now uses the crest of the arms on a blue field.

answer type: Automotive Class.
auxiliary information: The Autobianchi Stellina is a small spider from the Italian automaker, Autobianchi, built for only two years, 1964 and 1965. It was based on the mechanicals of the chassis Fiat 600D, but had a unique unibody structure, with the outside panels made of fibreglass reinforced plastics, based on a steel frame. It was the first Italian car with a fibreglass body, and one of the first in the world. Powered by Fiat 600D's rear-mounted, water-cooled 767 cc straight-4 engine, delivering 29 hp, the Stellina had drum brakes on all four wheels. With sleek styling penned by Luigi Rapi, the Stellina was first presented as a prototype at the 1963 Turin Motor Show, and went on sale a year later with a price tag of almost a million lira. Only 502 Stellinas were made until production ceased in 1965, when Fiat launched a, slightly larger, similar Fiat 850 Spider.

answer type: Artwork.
auxiliary information: In Greek mythology, Clio, also spelled Kleio, is the muse of history, or in a few mythological accounts, the muse of lyre playing. Like all the muses, she is a daughter of Zeus and the Titaness Mnemosyne. Along with her sisters, she was considered to dwell either Mount Helicon or Mount Parnassos. Other common locations for the Muses were Pieria in Thessaly, near to Mount Olympus. She had one son, Hyacinth, with one of several kings, in various myths‚Äîwith Pierus, King of Macedon, or with king Oebalus of Sparta, or with king Amyclas, progenitor of the people of Amyclae, dwellers about Sparta. Some sources say she was also the mother of Hymenaios. Other accounts credit her as the mother of Linus, a poet that was buried at Argos, but Linus has a number of differing parents depending upon the account, including several accounts where he is the son of Clio's sisters Urania or Calliope. All of the Muses were considered to be the best practitioners of their fields, and any mortal challenging them in their sphere was destined to be defeated. They were often associated with Apollo. The most common number of the Muses is 9, but the number is not always consistent in earlier mythologies.

Calamus is a software RIP application which generates high-quality output in any resolution. It was one of the first DTP applications supporting an own vector font format, notable for its support for automatic kerning even where adjacent characters are set in different fonts or at different sizes. Its high modularity offers features for almost every purpose in desktop publishing. Calamus also was one of the first DTP apps to support real virtual objects and frames, nondestructive vector masks, and editable PS/PDF import. Its measurement base of 1/10,000mm allows accurate positioning of elements. Calamus was ported to Windows by MGI Software and was released as Calamus 95. The current version of Calamus is Calamus SL2006, also available as SLC2006 and L2006.

answer: marquess of milford haven, marquess of stafford, marquess of lothian...
answer type: Noble title.
auxiliary information: A marquess is a nobleman of hereditary rank in various European peerages and in those of some of their former colonies. The term is also used to translate equivalent Asian styles, as in imperial China and Japan. In Great Britain and Ireland, the correct spelling of the aristocratic title of this rank is marquess. In Great Britain and Ireland, the title ranks below a duke and above an earl. A woman with the rank of a marquess, or the wife of a marquess, is called a marchioness /Àåm…ëÀêr É…ôÀàn…õs/ in Great Britain and Ireland or a marquise /m…ërÀàkiÀêz/ elsewhere in Europe. The dignity, rank or position of the title is referred to as a marquisate or marquessate. The theoretical distinction between a marquess and other titles has, since the Middle Ages, faded into obscurity. In times past, the distinction between a count and a marquess was that the land of a marquess, called a march, was on the border of the country, while a count's land, called a county, often was not. As a result of this, a marquess was trusted to defend and fortify against potentially hostile neighbors and was thus more important and ranked higher than a count.

answer: newton
answer type: Unit of Force.
auxiliary information: The International System of Units is the modern form of the metric system and is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both commerce and science. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. It defines twenty-two named units, and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram.

auxiliary information: Cytarabine or cytosine arabinoside is a chemotherapy agent used mainly in the treatment of cancers of white blood cells such as acute myeloid leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is also known as ara-C. It kills cancer cells by interfering with DNA synthesis. It is called cytosine arabinoside because it combines a cytosine base with an arabinose sugar. Cytosine normally combines with a different sugar, deoxyribose, to form deoxycytidine, a component of DNA. Certain sponges, where it was originally found, use arabinoside sugars to form a different compound. Cytosine arabinoside is similar enough to human cytosine deoxyribose to be incorporated into human DNA, but different enough that it kills the cell. This mechanism is used to kill cancer cells. Cytarabine is the first of a series of cancer drugs that altered the sugar component of nucleosides. Other cancer drugs modify the base. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medication needed in a basic health system.
output: ",[Cytarabine] has been tested for which medical trial?

answer type: Deity.
auxiliary information: Satanism is a broad term referring to a group of social movements with diverse ideological and philosophical beliefs. Satanism includes symbolic association with, or admiration for, Satan, whom Satanists see as an inspiring and liberating figure. It was estimated that there were 50,000 Satanists in 1990. There may now be as many as one hundred thousand Satanists in the world. Although the public practice of Satanism began with the founding of The Church of Satan in 1966, historical precedents exist: a group called the Ophite Cultus Satanas was founded in Ohio by Herbert Arthur Sloane in 1948. Satanist groups that appeared after the 1960s are widely diverse, but two major trends are theistic Satanism and atheistic Satanism. Theistic Satanists venerate Satan as a supernatural deity, viewing him not as omnipotent but rather as a patriarch. In contrast, atheistic Satanists regard Satan as merely a symbol of certain human traits. There are signs that Satanistic beliefs have become more socially tolerated.

auxiliary information: The International System of Units is the modern form of the metric system and is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both commerce and science. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. It defines twenty-two named units, and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram.

auxiliary information: SheiKra is a steel Dive Coaster roller coaster at the Busch Gardens Tampa Bay amusement park in Tampa, Florida, United States. The roller coaster was proposed by Mark Rose, vice-president of design and engineering for the park, and designed by Bolliger & Mabillard. The ride was planned to be 160 feet high, but the park's executives rejected this and the height was changed to 200 feet.

It first opened on May 21, 2005, and was converted to a floorless roller coaster on June 16, 2007, following the opening of its sister Dive Coaster Griffon at Busch Gardens Williamsburg that year. SheiKra was the first Dive Coaster to be constructed in North America; its track includes a splashdown and an Immelmann loop, both a first for its kind. It broke the records for the world's longest, tallest, and fastest Dive Coaster, but lost these records when Griffon in Williamsburg, Virginia, United States and Dive Coaster at Chime-Long Paradise in Guangzhou, China opened. The name SheiKra is derived from the word ""shikra"", an Asian-African hawk that is known to dive vertically for its prey.

answer type: Aircraft type.
auxiliary information: The Republic F-84 Thunderjet was an American turbojet fighter-bomber aircraft. Originating as a 1944 United States Army Air Forces proposal for a ""day fighter"", the F-84 first flew in 1946. Although it entered service in 1947, the Thunderjet was plagued by so many structural and engine problems that a 1948 U.S. Air Force review declared it unable to execute any aspect of its intended mission and considered canceling the program. The aircraft was not considered fully operational until the 1949 F-84D model and the design matured only with the definitive F-84G introduced in 1951. In 1954, the straight-wing Thunderjet was joined by the swept-wing F-84F Thunderstreak fighter and RF-84F Thunderflash photo reconnaissance aircraft. The Thunderjet became the USAF's primary strike aircraft during the Korean War, flying 86,408 missions and destroying 60% of all ground targets in the war as well as eight Soviet-built MiG fighters. Over half of the 7,524 F-84s produced served with NATO nations, and it was the first aircraft to fly with the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds demonstration team. The USAF Strategic Air Command had F-84 Thunderjets in service from 1948 through 1957.

input: original question: Which risk factor is related to [Bacterial vaginosis]?
answer: sexually transmitted infection, unsafe sex, pregnancy...
answer type: Risk Factor.
auxiliary information: Bacterial vaginosis, also known as vaginal bacteriosis or Gardnerella vaginitis, is a disease of the vagina caused by excessive bacteria. Common symptoms include increased vaginal discharge that often smells like fish. The discharge is usually white or gray in color. Burning with urination may occur. Itching is uncommon. Occasionally there may be no symptoms. Having BV increases the risk of infection by a number of other sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS. It also increases the risk of early delivery among pregnant women. BV is caused by an imbalance of the naturally occurring bacteria in the vagina. There is a change in the most common type of bacteria and a hundred to thousandfold increase in total numbers of bacteria present. Risk factors include douching, new or multiple sex partners, antibiotics, and using an intrauterine device among others. However, it is not considered a sexually transmitted infection. Diagnosis is suspected based on the symptoms and may be verified by testing the vaginal discharge and finding a higher than normal vaginal pH and large numbers of bacteria. BV is often confused with a vaginal yeast infection or infection with Trichomonas.

auxiliary information: Transcendentalism was a philosophical movement that was developing by the late 1820s and '30s in the Eastern region of the United States as a protest against the general state of intellectualism and spirituality. The doctrine of the Unitarian church as taught at Harvard Divinity School was of particular concern. Among the transcendentalists' core beliefs was the inherent goodness of both people and nature. They believe that society and its institutions‚Äîparticularly organized religion and political parties‚Äîultimately corrupt the purity of the individual. They have faith that people are at their best when truly ""self-reliant"" and independent. ""Self-reliant"" differs from the traditional usage of the word, however, and refers mainly to a fierce intellectual independence that believed itself capable of generating completely original insights with as little deference paid to past masters as possible.

input: original question: What is the unit of catalytic activity in measurement system [International System of Units]?
answer: katal
answer type: Unit of Catalytic Activity.
auxiliary information: The International System of Units is the modern form of the metric system and is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both commerce and science. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. It defines twenty-two named units, and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram.

input: original question: Which public figure with medical condition has condition [Tinnitus]?
answer: william shatner
answer type: Public figure with medical condition.
auxiliary information: Tinnitus is the hearing of sound when no external sound is present. While often described as a ringing, it may also sound like a clicking, hiss or roaring. Rarely, unclear voices or music are heard. The sound may be soft or loud, low pitched or high pitched and appear to be coming from one ear or both. Most of the time, it comes on gradually. In some people, the sound causes depression, anxiety or interferes with concentration. Tinnitus is not a disease but a symptom that can result from a number of underlying causes. One of the most common causes is noise-induced hearing loss. Other causes include: ear infections, disease of the heart or blood vessels, Meniere's disease, brain tumors, exposure to certain medications, a previous head injury and earwax. It is more common in those with depression. The diagnosis is usually based on the person's description. Occasionally, the sound may be heard by someone else using a stethoscope: in which case, it is known as objective tinnitus. A number of questionnaires exist that assess how much tinnitus is interfering with a person's life. People should have an audiogram and neurological exam as part of the diagnosis.
output: ",The condition [Tinnitus] is attributed to which public figure?

answer: asteriacites
answer type: Organism Classification.
auxiliary information: The Ordovician /…îrd…ôÀàv…™ É…ôn/ is a geologic period and system, the second of six of the Paleozoic Era, and covers the time between 485.4 ¬± 1.9 and 443.8 ¬± 1.5 million years ago. It follows the Cambrian Period and is followed by the Silurian Period. The Ordovician, named after the Celtic tribe of the Ordovices, was defined by Charles Lapworth in 1879 to resolve a dispute between followers of Adam Sedgwick and Roderick Murchison, who were placing the same rock beds in northern Wales into the Cambrian and Silurian periods, respectively. Lapworth, recognizing that the fossil fauna in the disputed strata were different from those of either the Cambrian or the Silurian periods, realized that they should be placed in a period of their own. While recognition of the distinct Ordovician period was slow in the United Kingdom, other areas of the world accepted it quickly. It received international sanction in 1960, when it was adopted as an official period of the Paleozoic Era by the International Geological Congress. Life continued to flourish during the Ordovician as it did in the Cambrian, although the end of the period was marked by a significant mass extinction.

A leading member of the revolutionary Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, and later, the Baghdad-based Ba'ath Party and its regional organization Ba'ath Party ‚Äì Iraq Region‚Äîwhich espoused ba'athism, a mix of Arab nationalism and Arab socialism‚ÄîSaddam played a key role in the 1968 coup that brought the party to power in Iraq. As vice president under the ailing General Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, and at a time when many groups were considered capable of overthrowing the government, Saddam created security forces through which he tightly controlled conflict between the government and the armed forces. In the early 1970s, Saddam nationalized oil and other industries. The state-owned banks were put under his control, leaving the system eventually insolvent mostly due to the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, the Gulf War, and UN sanctions. Through the 1970s, Saddam cemented his authority over the apparatuses of government as oil money helped Iraq's economy to grow at a rapid pace.

input: original question: what digital camera does have [Rangefinder camera] format?
answer: leica m8.2, leica m9, konica hexar rf...
answer type: Digital Camera.
auxiliary information: A rangefinder camera is a camera fitted with a rangefinder, typically a split-image rangefinder: a range-finding focusing mechanism allowing the photographer to measure the subject distance and take photographs that are in sharp focus. Most varieties of rangefinder show two images of the same subject, one of which moves when a calibrated wheel is turned; when the two images coincide and fuse into one, the distance can be read off the wheel. Older, non-coupled rangefinder cameras display the focusing distance and require the photographer to transfer the value to the lens focus ring; cameras without built-in rangefinders could have an external rangefinder fitted into the accessory shoe. Earlier cameras of this type had separate viewfinder and rangefinder windows; later the rangefinder was incorporated into the viewfinder. More modern designs have rangefinders coupled to the focusing mechanism, so that the lens is focused correctly when the rangefinder images fuse; compare with the focusing screen in non-autofocus SLRs. Accessory rangefinders, often fitting into the camera's accessory shoe, could be used with cameras with rangefinder not built in.
output: ",The [Rangefinder camera] format is used in which digital camera?

answer: 2007 eb26, 163693 atira, null...
answer type: Asteroid.
auxiliary information: Apohele asteroids, or alternatively Interior-Earth Objects or Atira asteroids, are a class of near-Earth asteroids. They have not only their perihelion within Earth's orbit, but also their aphelion; that is, their entire orbit is within Earth's. The first suspected Apohele was 1998 DK36, and the first confirmed was 163693 Atira in 2003. As of January 2015, there are 15 suspected Apoheles, of which eight have well-known orbits, of which five have been determined with sufficient precision to receive a permanent number; 28 more objects have aphelia smaller than Earth's aphelion. The Near Earth Object Surveillance Satellite is intended to find more. In great part because of the search methods used to look for asteroids, there are currently no known asteroids with orbits contained within Venus or Mercury's. There is no standard name for the class. The name Apohele was proposed by the discoverers of 1998 DK36, and is the Hawaiian word for orbit; it was chosen partially because of its similarity to the words aphelion and helios. Other authors adopted the designation Inner Earth Objects.

answer: darwinius masillae
answer type: Fossil specimen.
auxiliary information: Adapidae is a family of extinct primates that primarily radiated during the Eocene epoch between about 55 and 34 million years ago. Adapid systematics and evolutionary relationships are controversial, but there is fairly good evidence from the postcranial skeleton that adapids were stem strepsirrhines. In particular, the anatomy of the adapid wrist and ankle show derived similarities with those of living strepsirrhines. However, adapids lacked many of the anatomical specializations characteristic of living strepsirrhines, such as a toothcomb, a toilet-claw on the second pedal digit, and a reduction in the size of the promontory branch of the internal carotid artery. There are two major branches of adapids, subfamily Adapinae and subfamily Caenopithecinae. Caenopithecines are sometimes assigned to their own family, Caenopithecidae.

input: original question: which galaxy code have a shape of [Lenticular galaxy]?
answer: s0(3)/e3
answer type: Galaxy classification code.
auxiliary information: A lenticular galaxy is a type of galaxy which is intermediate between an elliptical galaxy and a spiral galaxy in galaxy morphological classification schemes. Lenticular galaxies are disc galaxies which have used up or lost most of their interstellar matter and therefore have very little ongoing star formation. They may, however, retain significant dust in their disks. As a result, they consist mainly of aging stars. Because of their ill-defined spiral arms, if they are inclined face-on it is often difficult to distinguish between them and elliptical galaxies. Despite the morphological differences, lenticular and elliptical galaxies share common properties like spectral features, scaling relations and both can be considered early type galaxies which are passively evolving, at least in the local universe.

answer: gray
answer type: Unit of Absorbed Dose.
auxiliary information: The International System of Units is the modern form of the metric system and is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both commerce and science. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. It defines twenty-two named units, and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram.

Whistler Blackcomb also features the Peak 2 Peak Gondola for moving between Whistler and Blackcomb mountains at the top; Peak 2 Peak holds records for the highest and longest unsupported cable car span in the world. With all of this capacity, Whistler Blackcomb is also often the most-visited ski resort, often besting 2 million visitors a year. Whistler was originally conceived as part of a bid to win the 1968 Winter Olympics, but a series of events led to the bids being withdrawn or losing to other cities. Construction of the resort started in spite of this, and the resort first opened for business in January 1966. The resort expanded extensively in the 1980s and 90s, becoming the centrepiece of a renewed bid on the part of nearby Vancouver. Vancouver/Whistler was selected as the winning bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics in July 2003.

answer: mathematical table
answer type: Project focus.
auxiliary information: The Mathematical Tables Project was one of the largest and most sophisticated computing organizations that operated prior to the invention of the digital electronic computer. Begun in 1938 as a project of the Works Progress Administration, it employed 450 out-of-work clerks to tabulate higher mathematical functions, such as exponential functions, logarithms, and trigonometric functions. These tables eventually filled 28 volumes, which were published by Columbia University Press. The group was led by a group of mathematicians and physicists, most of whom had been unable to find professional work during the Depression. The mathematical leader was Gertrude Blanch, who had just finished her doctorate in mathematics at Cornell University. She had been unable to find a university position and was working at a photographic company before joining the project. The administrative director was Arnold Lowan, who had a degree in physics from Columbia and had spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton before returning to New York without a job.

answer: the fabric of our lives, there for me, in my opinion...
answer type: Musical Album.
auxiliary information: In music, a single or record single is a type of release, typically a song recording of fewer tracks than an LP record or an album. This can be released for sale to the public in a variety of different formats.

input: original question: Which celestial object category has [White dwarf] as a subcategory?
answer: star
answer type: Celestial object category.
auxiliary information: A white dwarf, also called a degenerate dwarf, is a stellar remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A white dwarf is very dense: its mass is comparable to that of the Sun, and its volume is comparable to that of the Earth. A white dwarf's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy. The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, 8.6 light years away, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910 by Henry Norris Russell, Edward Charles Pickering, and Williamina Fleming, p. 1 the name white dwarf was coined by Willem Luyten in 1922. White dwarfs are thought to be the final evolutionary state of all stars whose mass is not high enough to become a neutron star‚Äîover 97% of the stars in the Milky Way, ¬ß1. After the hydrogen‚Äìfusing lifetime of a main-sequence star of low or medium mass ends, it will expand to a red giant which fuses helium to carbon and oxygen in its core by the triple-alpha process.

input: original question: what medical trial has been tried for [Cerebrovascular disease]?
answer: vitamin e and c to slow progression of common carotid artery plaque build-up
answer type: Medical trial.
auxiliary information: Cerebrovascular disease is a group of brain dysfunctions related to disease of the blood vessels supplying the brain. Hypertension is the most important cause; it damages the blood vessel lining, endothelium, exposing the underlying collagen where platelets aggregate to initiate a repairing process which is not always complete and perfect. Sustained hypertension permanently changes the architecture of the blood vessels making them narrow, stiff, deformed, uneven and more vulnerable to fluctuations in blood pressure. A fall in blood pressure during sleep can then lead to a marked reduction in blood flow in the narrowed blood vessels causing ischemic stroke in the morning. Conversely, a sudden rise in blood pressure due to excitation during the daytime can cause tearing of the blood vessels resulting in intracranial hemorrhage. Cerebrovascular disease primarily affects people who are elderly or have a history of diabetes, smoking, or ischemic heart disease. The results of cerebrovascular disease can include a stroke, or occasionally a hemorrhagic stroke. Ischemia or other blood vessel dysfunctions can affect the person during a cerebrovascular incident.

input: original question: Which organism classifications has the lower rank than [Species]?
answer: superspecies, series, section...
answer type: Organism Classification Rank.
auxiliary information: In biology, a species is one of the basic units of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms where two hybrids are capable of reproducing fertile offspring, typically using sexual reproduction. While in many cases this definition is adequate, the difficulty of defining species is known as the species problem. Differing measures are often used, such as similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. Presence of specific locally adapted traits may further subdivide species into ""infraspecific taxa"" such as subspecies. Species hypothesized to have the same ancestors are placed in one genus, based on similarities. The similarity of species is judged based on comparison of physical attributes, and where available, their DNA sequences. All species are given a two-part name, a ""binomial name"", or just ""binomial"". The first part of a binomial is the generic name, the genus to which the species belongs. The second part is either called the specific name or the specific epithet. For example, Boa constrictor is one of four species of the Boa genus. While the genus gets capitalized, the species name does not.

Each match consisted of 60 overs per team and was played in traditional white clothing and with red balls; all were played during the day and hence started early. England, New Zealand, the West Indies and Australia were the teams to qualify for the semi-finals, making this the only World Cup thus far in which no team from the Indian subcontinent made this stage. Australia defeated England and the West Indies beat New Zealand, before the West Indies, the pre-tournament favourites, defeated Australia in the final at Lord's by 17 runs to become the first World Cup winners.

answer: sylacauga, murchison meteorite, park forest...
answer type: Meteorite.
auxiliary information: Chondrites are stony meteorites that have not been modified due to melting or differentiation of the parent body. They are formed when various types of dust and small grains that were present in the early solar system accreted to form primitive asteroids. They are the most common type of meteorite that falls to Earth with estimates for the proportion of the total fall that they represent varying between 85.7% and 86.2%. Their study provides important clues for understanding the origin and age of the Solar System, the synthesis of organic compounds, the origin of life or the presence of water on Earth. One of their characteristics is the presence of chondrules, which are round grains formed by distinct minerals, that normally constitute between 20% and 80% of a chondrite by volume. Chondrites can be differentiated from iron meteorites due to their low iron and nickel content. Other non-metallic meteorites, achondrites, which lack chondrules, were formed more recently. There are currently over 27,000 chondrites in the world's collections. The largest individual stone ever recovered, weighing 1770 kg, was part of the Jilin meteorite shower of 1976.

auxiliary information: Electromagnetism is the study of the electromagnetic force which is a type of physical interaction that occurs between electrically charged particles. The electromagnetic force usually shows electromagnetic fields, such as electric fields, magnetic fields, and light. The electromagnetic force is one of the four fundamental interactions in nature. The other three fundamental interactions are the strong interaction, the weak interaction, and gravitation. The word electromagnetism is a compound form of two Greek terms, ·º¢ŒªŒµŒ∫œÑœÅŒøŒΩ, ƒìlektron, ""amber"", and ŒºŒ±Œ≥ŒΩŒÆœÑŒ∑œÇ, magnetic, from ""magn√≠tis l√≠thos"", which means ""magnesian stone"", a type of iron ore. The science of electromagnetic phenomena is defined in terms of the electromagnetic force, sometimes called the Lorentz force, which includes both electricity and magnetism as elements of one phenomenon. The electromagnetic force plays a major role in determining the internal properties of most objects encountered in daily life. Ordinary matter takes its form as a result of intermolecular forces between individual molecules in matter.

input: original question: Which measurement system has the energy units [Hartree]?
answer: atomic units
answer type: Measurement System.
auxiliary information: The hartree, also known as the Hartree energy, is the atomic unit of energy, named after the British physicist Douglas Hartree. It is defined as 2R‚àûhc, where R‚àû is the Rydberg constant, h is the Planck constant and c is the speed of light. The 2010 CODATA recommended value is E‚Çï = 4.359 744 34√ó10^‚àí18 J = 27.211 385 05 eV. The 2006 CODATA recommended value was E‚Çï = 4.359 743 94 √ó10^‚àí18 J = 27.211 383 86 eV. The hartree energy is approximately the electric potential energy of the hydrogen atom in its ground state and, by the virial theorem, approximately twice its ionization energy; the relationships are not exact because of the finite mass of the nucleus of the hydrogen atom and relativistic corrections. The hartree is usually used as a unit of energy in atomic physics and computational chemistry: for experimental measurements at the atomic scale, the electronvolt or the reciprocal centimetre are much more widely used.

About 3% of submarine canyons are joined to shelf valleys that connect with large rivers; the largest canyons incise into the continental shelf but the largest number of canyons terminate on the slope, making so-called ‚Äúblind‚Äù or ‚Äúheadless‚Äù canyons. Canyons cutting the continental slopes have been found at depths greater than 2 km below sea level. Many submarine canyons continue as submarine channels across continental rise areas and may extend seawards for hundreds of kilometres onto the abyssal plain. Ancient examples have been found in rocks dating back to the Neoproterozoic. Turbidites are formed in submarine canyons.
output: ",The subcategories of [Submarine canyon] is part of which geographical feature category?

input: original question: Which fictional object is composed of [Timber framing]?
answer: citadel of lemuria
answer type: Fictional Object.
auxiliary information: Timber framing and ""post-and-beam"" construction are methods of building with heavy timbers rather than dimensional lumber such as 2""x4""s. Traditional timber framing is the method of creating structures using heavy squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs. It is commonplace in wooden buildings from the 19th century and earlier. The method comes from making things out of logs and tree trunks without modern high tech saws to cut lumber from the starting material stock. Using axes, adzes, and draw knives, hand-powered auger drill bits, and laborious woodworking, artisans or farmers could gradually assemble a building capable of bearing heavy weight without excessive use of interior space given over to vertical support posts. Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world, there are many styles of historic framing. These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation, walls, how and where the beams intersect, the use of curved timbers, and the roof framing details. Three basic types of timber frames in English-speaking countries are the box frame, cruck frame, and aisled frame.
output: ",What is the name of the fictional object composed of [Timber framing]?

input: original question: Which unit of energy density uses [International System of Units]?
answer: joule per cubic metre
answer type: Unit of Energy Density.
auxiliary information: The International System of Units is the modern form of the metric system and is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both commerce and science. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. It defines twenty-two named units, and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram.

answer type: Issue.
auxiliary information: An American depositary receipt is a negotiable security that represents securities of a non-U.S. company that trades in the U.S. financial markets. Shares of many non-U.S. companies trade on U.S. stock exchanges through ADRs, which are denominated and pay dividends in U.S. dollars and may be traded like regular shares of stock. ADRs are also traded during U.S. trading hours, through U.S. broker-dealers. They simplify investing in foreign securities by having the depositary bank ""manage all custody, currency and local taxes issues"". The first ADR was introduced by J.P. Morgan in 1927 for the British retailer Selfridges on the New York Curb Exchange, the American Stock Exchange's precursor. They are the domestic equivalent of a global depository receipt. Securities of a foreign company that are represented by an ADR are called American depositary shares.

input: original question: what engines do belong to [Diesel engine] category?
answer: kl√∂ckner-humboldt-deutz dz 710, weslake aero-engine, bristol phoenix...
answer type: Engine.
auxiliary information: The diesel engine is an internal combustion engine in which ignition of the fuel that has been injected into the combustion chamber is initiated by the high temperature which a gas achieves when greatly compressed. This contrasts with spark-ignition engines such as a petrol engine or gas engine, which use a spark plug to ignite an air-fuel mixture. The diesel engine has the highest thermal efficiency of any standard internal or external combustion engine due to its very high compression ratio and inherent lean burn which enables heat dissipation by the excess air. A small efficiency loss is also avoided compared to two-stroke non-direct-injection gasoline engines since unburnt fuel is not present at valve overlap and therefore no fuel goes directly from the intake/injection to the exhaust. Low-speed diesel engines can have a thermal efficiency that exceeds 50%. Diesel engines are manufactured in two-stroke and four-stroke versions. They were originally used as a more efficient replacement for stationary steam engines. Since the 1910s they have been used in submarines and ships. Use in locomotives, trucks, heavy equipment and electricity generation plants followed later.

input: original question: what cricket event does [The Ashes] series have?
answer: 2005 ashes series, 2006‚äì07 ashes series, 2013 ashes series
answer type: Cricket Series Event.
auxiliary information: The Ashes is a Test cricket series played between England and Australia. The Ashes are regarded as being held by the team that most recently won the Test series. The term originated in a satirical obituary published in a British newspaper, The Sporting Times, immediately after Australia's 1882 victory at The Oval, their first Test win on English soil. The obituary stated that English cricket had died, and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia. The mythical ashes immediately became associated with the 1882‚Äì83 series played in Australia, before which the English captain Ivo Bligh had vowed to ""regain those ashes"". The English media therefore dubbed the tour the quest to regain the Ashes. After England had won two of the three Tests on the tour, a small urn was presented to Bligh by a group of Melbourne women including Florence Morphy, whom Bligh married within a year. The contents of the urn are reputed to be the ashes of a wooden bail, and were humorously described as ""the ashes of Australian cricket"". It is not clear whether that ""tiny silver urn"" is the same as the small terracotta urn given to the MCC by Bligh's widow after his death in 1927.

answer: ralph s. greco, paul ruffin, eleanor campbell

auxiliary information: Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale. The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter that occur below the given size threshold. It is therefore common to see the plural form ""nanotechnologies"" as well as ""nanoscale technologies"" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size.

Commercial bank can also refer to a bank or a division of a bank that mostly deals with deposits and loans from corporations or large businesses, as opposed to individual members of the public. In the United States the term ""commercial bank"" was often used to distinguish it from an investment bank due to differences in bank regulation. After the Great Depression, through the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act, the U.S. Congress required that commercial banks only engage in banking activities, whereas investment banks were limited to capital market activities. This separation was mostly repealed in 1999 by the Gramm‚ÄìLeach‚ÄìBliley Act but was restored by the Volcker Rule, implemented in January 2014 as part of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010.

input: original question: Which composition type contains [Mass] as the sub-forms?
answer: sacred music
answer type: Composition type.
auxiliary information: The Mass, a form of sacred musical composition, is a choral composition that sets the invariable portions of the Eucharistic liturgy to music. Most Masses are settings of the liturgy in Latin, the liturgical sacred language of the Catholic Church's Roman liturgy, but there are a significant number written in the languages of non-Catholic countries where vernacular worship has long been the norm. For example, there are many Masses written in English for the Church of England. Musical Masses take their name from the Catholic liturgy called ""the Mass"" as well. Masses can be a cappella, that is, without an independent accompaniment, or they can be accompanied by instrumental obbligatos up to and including a full orchestra. Many Masses, especially later ones, were never intended to be performed during the celebration of an actual mass.

auxiliary information: Sheep are quadrupedal, ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name ""sheep"" applies to many species in the genus Ovis, in everyday usage it almost always refers to Ovis aries. Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a ewe, an intact male as a ram or occasionally a tup, a castrated male as a wether, and a younger sheep as a lamb. Sheep are most likely descended from the wild mouflon of Europe and Asia. One of the earliest animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes, sheep are raised for fleece, meat and milk. A sheep's wool is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by shearing. Ovine meat is called lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones. Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for pelts, as dairy animals, or as model organisms for science. Sheep husbandry is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world, and has been fundamental to many civilizations.

answer: joule per kilogram, joule per gram
answer type: Unit of Specific Energy.
auxiliary information: The International System of Units is the modern form of the metric system and is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both commerce and science. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. It defines twenty-two named units, and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram.

input: original question: Which roller coaster has a propulsion of [Powered]?
answer: back at the barnyard hayride, runaway mine train, null...
answer type: Roller Coaster.
auxiliary information: A powered roller coaster is a railed amusement ride similar to a roller coaster. Unlike a true roller coaster, the train is powered through the entire course, rather than being allowed to coast after an initial lift or launch. This allows for both compact layouts that start out with curving hills, or long, extended layouts that would need too many lifts to be feasible. The most common manufacturers of powered coasters are Mack, Wisdom Rides, and Zamperla. Due to the family-oriented nature of the rides, height restrictions can be as little as 36 inches or taller for someone to ride. The most common model of powered coasters is the Zamperla Dragon coasters. Other installations include Casey Junior, Le Petit Train du Cirque at Disneyland Park, Thunder Run at Canada's Wonderland, Runaway Mine Train at Alton Towers and High in the Sky Seuss Trolley Train Ride at Islands of Adventure. The train on a powered coaster usually picks up electricity from contacts in the rails and may contain multiple motors. Some powered coasters are powered by a flexible cable connected to the train. Another component of powered coasters is an extra ""track"" in the center of the rails.
output: ",[Powered] is the propulsion for what roller coaster?

input: original question: What is the unit of surface tension in measurement system [International System of Units]?
answer: newton per metre
answer type: Unit of Surface Tension.
auxiliary information: The International System of Units is the modern form of the metric system and is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both commerce and science. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. It defines twenty-two named units, and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram.

input: original question: What is the unit of acceleration in measurement system [Centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system of units]?
answer: gal
answer type: Unit of Acceleration.
auxiliary information: The centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system of units is a variant of the metric system based on the centimetre as the unit of length, the gram as the unit of mass, and the second as the unit of time. All CGS mechanical units are unambiguously derived from these three base units, but there are several different ways of extending the CGS system to cover electromagnetism. The CGS system has been largely supplanted by the MKS system based on the metre, kilogram, and second, which was in turn extended and replaced by the International System of Units. In many fields of science and engineering, SI is the only system of units in use but there remain certain subfields where CGS is prevalent. In measurements of purely mechanical systems, the differences between CGS and SI are straightforward and rather trivial; the unit-conversion factors are all powers of 10 as 100 cm = 1 m and 1000 g = 1 kg. For example, the CGS unit of force is the dyne which is defined as 1 g¬∑cm/s¬≤, so the SI unit of force, the newton, is equal to 100,000 dynes. On the other hand, in measurements of electromagnetic phenomena, converting between CGS and SI is much more subtle and involved.
output: ","In the measurement system [Centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system of units], what is the unit of acceleration?"

answer: yorkfield
answer type: Computer Processor.
auxiliary information: Penryn is the code name of a processor from Intel that is sold in varying configurations as Core 2 Solo, Core 2 Duo, Core 2 Quad, Pentium and Celeron. During development, Penryn was the Intel code name for the 2007/2008 ""Tick"" of Intel's Tick-Tock cycle which shrunk Merom to 45 nanometers as CPUID model 23. The term Penryn is sometimes used to refer to all 45 nm chips with the Core architecture. Chips with Penryn architecture come in two sizes, with 6 MiB and 3 MiB L2 cache. Low power versions of Penryn are known as the Penryn processor. The smaller version is commonly called Penryn-3M and is used for the single-core processors. The Penryn-QC quad-cores are made from two chips with two cores and 6 MB of cache per chip. The desktop version of Penryn is Wolfdale and the dual-socket server version is Wolfdale-DP. Penryn-QC is related to Yorkfield on the desktop and Harpertown in servers. The MP server Dunnington chip is a more distant relative based on a different chip but using the same 45 nm Core microarchitecture. Penryn was replaced by the Nehalem based Arrandale and Clarksfield.

answer: strait
answer type: Geographical feature category.
auxiliary information: Frozen Strait is a waterway in Nunavut just north of Hudson Bay between the Melville Peninsula to the north and Southampton Island to the south. It connects Repulse Bay to the west with Foxe Basin to the east. The strait is 80 km long, and 19 to 32 km wide. In 1615 Robert Bylot was blocked by ice at its east end. In 1742 Christopher Middleton reached the west end. He sailed north through Roes Welcome Sound to Repulse Bay. Seeing the strait ice-filled in August, it seemed clear that there was no passage so he gave the names Frozen Strait and Repulse Bay. In 1821 William Edward Parry passed the strait with no difficulty. In W. Gillies Ross' 1974 study Distribution, Migration, and Depletion of Bowhead Whales in Hudson Bay, 1860 to 1915, he suggests that bowhead whales appeared to migrate in the spring and fall through Roes Welcome Sound, but the possibility of migration through Frozen Strait cannot be ruled out.

input: original question: Which multi-event tournament has the sports of [Surfing]?
answer: 2014 asp world tour
answer type: Multi-event tournament.
auxiliary information: Surfing is a surface water sport in which the wave rider, referred to as a surfer, rides on the forward or deep face of a moving wave, which is usually carrying the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found in the ocean, but can also be found in lakes or in rivers in the form of a standing wave or tidal bore. However, surfers can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial wave pools. The term surfing refers to the act of riding a wave, regardless of whether the wave is ridden with a board or without a board, and regardless of the stance used. The native peoples of the Pacific, for instance, surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such craft, and did so on their belly and knees. The modern-day definition of surfing, however, most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing up on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing. One variety of stand-up surfing is paddle boarding. Another prominent form of surfing is body boarding, when a surfer rides a wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee, or sometimes even standing up on a body board.

input: original question: What organism part is from [Sheep]?
answer: lamb brain
answer type: Organism part.
auxiliary information: Sheep are quadrupedal, ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name ""sheep"" applies to many species in the genus Ovis, in everyday usage it almost always refers to Ovis aries. Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a ewe, an intact male as a ram or occasionally a tup, a castrated male as a wether, and a younger sheep as a lamb. Sheep are most likely descended from the wild mouflon of Europe and Asia. One of the earliest animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes, sheep are raised for fleece, meat and milk. A sheep's wool is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by shearing. Ovine meat is called lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones. Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for pelts, as dairy animals, or as model organisms for science. Sheep husbandry is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world, and has been fundamental to many civilizations.

The counterpart term for such a church in German is Dom from Latin domus ecclesiae or domus episcopalis; also Italian Duomo, Dutch Domkerk and cognates in many other European languages. Churches with the function of ""cathedral"" are specific to those Christian denominations with an episcopal hierarchy, such as the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox, and some Lutheran and Methodist churches. Church buildings embodying the functions of a cathedral first appear in Italy, Gaul, Spain and North Africa in the 4th century, but cathedrals did not become universal within the Western Catholic Church until the 12th century, by which time they had developed architectural forms, institutional structures and legal identities distinct from parish churches, monastic churches and episcopal residences.

input: original question: Which organization has the legal structure of [Kommanditgesellschaft]?
answer: emmemedia, bank lombard odier & co ltd, viega...
answer type: Organization.
auxiliary information: A Kommanditgesellschaft is the German name for a limited partnership business entity and is used in German, Austrian and some other European legal systems. Partnerships may be formed in the legal forms of General Partnership or Limited Partnership. In the OHG, all partners are fully liable for the partnership's debts, whereas in the KG there are general partners with unlimited liability and limited partners whose liability is restricted to their fixed contributions to the partnership. Although a partnership itself is not a legal entity, it may acquire rights and incur liabilities, acquire title to real estate and sue or be sued. The GmbH & Co. KG is a limited partnership with, typically, the sole general partner being a limited liability company. It can thus combine the advantages of a partnership with those of the limited liability of a corporation. A Dormant Partnership comes into existence when a person makes a contribution to an existing enterprise and shares in the latter's profits. The dormant partner has no liability for the debts of the enterprise; in case of insolvency of the enterprise he is a creditor with the portion of his contribution not consumed by losses.

The final result was a 2‚Äì1 series win for England, who succeeded in their biennial attempt to win the urn.

They reached a low point in 1999 with a series loss to New Zealand leaving them bottom of the unofficial Wisden Cricketers' Almanack rankings.

input: original question: Who is the video game content descriptor in [Pan European Game Information]?
answer: violence, bad language, drugs...
answer type: Video Game Content Descriptor.
auxiliary information: Pan European Game Information is a European video game content rating system established to help European consumers make informed decisions on buying computer games with logos on games' boxes. It was developed by the Interactive Software Federation of Europe and came into use in April 2003; it replaced many national age rating systems with a single European system. The PEGI system is now used in more than thirty countries and is based on a code of conduct, a set of rules to which every publisher using the PEGI system is contractually committed. PEGI self-regulation is composed by five age categories and eight content descriptors that advise the suitability and content of a game for a certain age range based on the games content. The age rating is not intended to indicate the difficulty of the game or the skill required to play it. On 30 July 2012, PEGI became the sole system for age classification of video games in the United Kingdom. As a result, games no longer have to be rated separately by the BBFC. Products with PEGI ratings are regularly available in countries outside Europe, having been exported for language reasons.

answer: inhalation
answer type: Drug administration route.
auxiliary information: Nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas, nitrous, nitro, or NOS is a chemical compound with the formula N 2O. It is an oxide of nitrogen. At room temperature, it is a colourless, non-flammable gas, with a slightly sweet odour and taste. It is used in surgery and dentistry for its anaesthetic and analgesic effects. It is known as ""laughing gas"" due to the euphoric effects of inhaling it, a property that has led to its recreational use as a dissociative anaesthetic. It is also used as an oxidizer in the launching of rockets and in motor racing to increase the power output of engines. At elevated temperatures, nitrous oxide is a powerful oxidizer similar to molecular oxygen. Nitrous oxide gives rise to nitric oxide on reaction with oxygen atoms, and this NO in turn reacts with ozone. As a result, it is the main naturally occurring regulator of stratospheric ozone. It is also a major greenhouse gas and air pollutant. Considered over a 100-year period, it has 298 times more impact per unit mass than carbon dioxide. It is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a health system.

Contemporary Paganism as practiced in the United States in the 1990s has been described as ""a synthesis of historical inspiration and present-day creativity"". Adherents rely on pre-Christian, folkloric and ethnographic sources to a variety of degrees; many follow a spirituality, which they accept as being entirely modern, while others attempt to reconstruct or revive indigenous, ethnic religions as found in historical and folkloric sources as accurately as possible. Polytheism, animism, and pantheism are common features in Pagan theology.

answer type: Isotope.
auxiliary information: Scandium is a chemical element with symbol Sc and atomic number 21. A silvery-white metallic d-block element, it has historically been sometimes classified as a rare earth element, together with yttrium and the lanthanoids. It was discovered in 1879 by spectral analysis of the minerals euxenite and gadolinite from Scandinavia. Scandium is present in most of the deposits of rare earth and uranium compounds, but it is extracted from these ores in only a few mines worldwide. Because of the low availability and the difficulties in the preparation of metallic scandium, which was first done in 1937, it took until the 1970s before applications for scandium were developed. The positive effects of scandium on aluminium alloys were discovered in the 1970s, and its use in such alloys remains its only major application. The global trade of the pure metal is around fifty kilograms per year on average. The properties of scandium compounds are intermediate between those of aluminium and yttrium. A diagonal relationship exists between the behavior of magnesium and scandium, just as there is between beryllium and aluminium.

answer: iranian presidential election, 2009
answer type: Election contest.
auxiliary information: The President of Iran is the head of government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The President is the highest popularly elected official in Iran, although the President answers to the Supreme Leader of Iran, who functions as the country's head of state. Chapter IX of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran sets forth the qualifications for presidential candidates and procedures for election, as well as the President's powers and responsibilities as ""functions of the executive"". These include signing treaties and other agreements with foreign countries and international organizations; administering national planning, budget, and state employment affairs; and appointing ministers subject to the approval of Parliament. Unlike the executive in other countries, the President of Iran does not have full control over Iran's foreign policy, the armed forces, or nuclear policy, as these are ultimately under the control and are the responsibility of the Supreme Leader. The President of Iran is elected for a four-year term by the direct vote of the people and may not serve for more than two consecutive terms or more than 8 years.
output: ",Office of [President of Iran] is chosed by what election contest?

answer: speyburn 10 year old
answer type: Distilled spirit.
auxiliary information: The Speyburn-Glenlivet Distillery was founded in 1897 by John Hopkins & Company for the sum of ¬£17,000. The site was chosen by John Hopkins himself for its unpolluted water supply from the Granty Burn, one of the major tributaries to the River Spey. Hopkins appointed the famous distillery architect Charles C Doig to design the distillery and to this day Speyburn has its classic pagoda ventilator, a hallmark of Doig's design. The proprietors, keen to have production started to ensure that the first fillings could bear the date 1897 - Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee - had scheduled production to begin on 1 November 1897. However, due to delays, the stills did not run until 15 December. When production finally began, the still house was without doors and windows. Under the watchful eye of the distillery's manager, John Smith, the first spirit was run off in a violent snow storm with the distillery men working in overcoats and mufflers to protect them from the elements. However, the proprietors succeeded in achieving their ambition and one butt was produced and bonded bearing the date 1897.

input: original question: Which unit of permittivity uses the measurement system of [International System of Units]?
answer: farad per metre
answer type: Unit of Permittivity.
auxiliary information: The International System of Units is the modern form of the metric system and is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both commerce and science. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. It defines twenty-two named units, and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram.

answer: generic top-level domain
answer type: Top Level Domain Type.
auxiliary information: The domain name info is a generic top-level domain in the Domain Name System of the Internet. The name is derived from information indicating that the domain is intended for informative Internet resources, although registration requirements do not prescribe any theme orientation. The info TLD was a response to ICANN's highly publicized announcement, in late 2000, of a phased release of seven new generic top-level domains. The event was the first addition of major gTLDs since the Domain Name System was developed in the 1980s. The seven new gTLDs, selected from over 180 proposals, were meant in part to take the pressure off the com domain. The info domain has been the most successful of the seven new domain names, with over 5.2 million domain names in the registry as of April 2008. After the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York switched to the easier to remember mta.info website to lead users to latest information on schedules and route changes on the area's transportation services. ICANN and Afilias have also sealed an agreement for country names to be reserved by ICANN under resolution 01.92.

The development team was mindful that this innovation would change the overall feel of the game.

input: original question: Which cloud classification includes the cloud of [Altocumulus]?
answer: family b (mid-level)
answer type: Cloud classification.
auxiliary information: Altocumulus is a middle-altitude cloud genus that belongs to the stratocumuliform physical category characterized by globular masses or rolls in layers or patches, the individual elements being larger and darker than those of cirrocumulus and smaller than those of stratocumulus. Like other cumuliform and stratocumuliform clouds, altocumulus signifies convection. It is usually white or grey, and often occurs in sheets or patches with wavy, rounded masses or rolls. A sheet of partially conjoined altocumulus perlucidus is sometimes found preceding a weakening warm front, where the altostratus is starting to fragment, resulting in patches of altocumulus perlucidus between the areas of altostratus. Altocumulus is also commonly found between the warm and cold fronts in a depression, although this is often hidden by lower clouds. Towering altocumulus, known as altocumulus castellanus, frequently signals the development of thunderstorms later in the day, as it shows instability and convection in the middle levels of the troposphere, the area where towering cumulus clouds can turn into cumulonimbus.

answer type: Place of worship.
auxiliary information: A Hindu temple is a house of god. It is a space and structure designed to bring human beings and gods together, infused with symbolism to express the ideas and beliefs of Hinduism. A Hindu temple, states George Michell, functions as a place of transcendence, where man may cross over from the world of illusion to one of knowledge and truth. The symbolism and structure of a Hindu temple, states Stella Kramrisch, are rooted in Vedic traditions. A temple incorporates all elements of Hindu cosmos - presenting the good, the evil and the human, as well as the elements of Hindu sense of cyclic time and the essence of life - symbolically presenting dharma, kama, artha, moksa and karma. The spiritual principles symbolically represented in Hindu temples are given in the ancient Sanskrit texts of India, while their structural rules are described in various ancient Sanskrit treatises on architecture. The layout, the motifs, the plan and the building process recite ancient rituals, geometric symbolisms, and reflect beliefs and values innate within various schools of Hinduism.

auxiliary information: A refrigerator is a common household appliance that consists of a thermally insulated compartment and a heat pump that transfers heat from the inside of the fridge to its external environment so that the inside of the fridge is cooled to a temperature below the ambient temperature of the room. Refrigeration is an essential food storage technique in developed countries. The lower temperature lowers the reproduction rate of bacteria, so the refrigerator reduces the rate of spoilage. A refrigerator maintains a temperature a few degrees above the freezing point of water. Optimum temperature range for perishable food storage is 3 to 5 ¬∞C. A similar device that maintains a temperature below the freezing point of water is called a freezer. The refrigerator replaced the icebox, which was a common household appliance for almost a century and a half prior. For this reason, a refrigerator is sometimes referred to as an icebox in American usage. The first cooling systems for food involved using ice. Artificial refrigeration began in the mid-1750s, and developed in the early 1800s. In 1834, the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system was built.

auxiliary information: Australian rules football, officially known as Australian football, also called football, footy, or Aussie rules, is a sport played between two teams of eighteen players on the field of either an Australian football ground, a modified cricket field, or a similarly sized sports venue. The main way to score points is by kicking the ball between the two tall goal posts. The team with the higher total score at the end of the match wins unless a draw is declared. During general play, players may position themselves anywhere on the field and use any part of their bodies to move the ball. The primary methods are kicking, handballing and running with the ball. There are rules on how the ball can be handled: for example, players running with the ball must intermittently bounce or touch it on the ground. Throwing the ball is not allowed and players must not get caught holding the ball. Possession of the ball is in dispute at all times except when a free kick or mark is paid. A distinctive feature of the game is the mark, where players anywhere on the field who catch a ball from a kick are awarded possession.

auxiliary information: North Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, is a country in East Asia, in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula. The capital and largest city is Pyongyang. North Korea shares a land border with China to the north and north-west, along the Amnok and Tumen rivers, and a small section of the Tumen River also forms a border with Russia to the north-east. The Korean Demilitarized Zone marks the de facto boundary between North Korea and South Korea. The legitimacy of this border is not accepted by either side, as both states claim to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula. The Empire of Japan annexed Korea in 1910. After the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945, Korea was divided into two zones by the United States and the Soviet Union, with the north occupied by the Soviets and the south by the Americans. Negotiations on reunification failed, and in 1948 two separate governments were formed: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the north, and the Republic of Korea in the south. These conflicting claims of sovereignty led to the Korean War.

answer type: Fictional Object Destruction Method.
auxiliary information: War horses were critical to the performance of armies, ancient and modern, from the time that cavalry became a factor in warfare until the middle of the 20th century, when German horses pulled cannon to the battlefield.  In Greek mythology, Diomedes stole war horses from Heracles and fed them on human flesh.  In the Iliad fictional universe, Odysseus and Diomedes schemed to steal Tros horses, the most desirable war horses descended from steeds given to Tros by Zeus, from Hektor.  Historically, a hero-cult sprang up in classical times centered upon the sacrifice of white hoses to Diomedes. A Thessalian horse, Bucephalus, was the war horse of Alexander the Great through the majority of his campaigns.  In the Sacred Band of Stepsons universe, Tros horses are given to Tempus by Abarsis, Slaughter Priest, which, when crossed with Askelonian horses bred by the regent of the seventh sphere, produced horses on a par with those owned by Achilles in the Iliad:  fast enough to run over water, with god-given abilities to see the future. War horses provided cavalry with decisive capabilities well into the 20th century AD  and served as the basis for the development of the combined armed force in modern warfare.

Antlia is bordered by Hydra the sea snake, Pyxis the compass, Vela the sails, and Centaurus the centaur. This group of constellations is prominent in the southern sky in late winter and spring. NGC 2997, a spiral galaxy, and the Antlia Dwarf Galaxy lie within Antlia's borders.
output: ",The constellation of [Antlia] is home to which star?

input: original question: Which space agency has the spaceports of [Svobodny Cosmodrome]?
answer: russian federal space agency
answer type: Space Agency.
auxiliary information: Svobodny was a Russian rocket launch site located at 51 degrees north in the Amur Oblast. The cosmodrome was originally constructed as a launch site for intercontinental ballistic missiles called Svobodny-18. It was initially selected as a replacement for Baikonur Cosmodrome in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, which became independent as Kazakhstan after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. However the development of Svobodny was subsequently ended in 2007 in favour of a totally new space port, the Vostochny Cosmodrome. The breakup of the Soviet Union left their primary cosmodrome at Baikonur in a foreign country, Kazakhistan. An arrangement to rent the facilities was arranged. Launches were moved to other facilities, like Plesetsk Cosmodrome, but this location is too far north to be useful for many launches. Studies for a far-east location closer to the latitude of Baikonur started, and initially settled on the existing missile base at Svobodny. This was located near the railway station of Ledyanaya, and had been used for several decades by the 27th rocket division of Strategic Rocket Forces.
