answer type: Wine.
auxiliary information: Canada is a country, consisting of ten provinces and three territories, in the northern part of the continent of North America. It extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres in total, making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's common border with the United States forms the world's longest land border. The land now called Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the late 15th century, British and French colonies were established on the region's Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost North American territories until left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867, three colonies joined to form the autonomous federal Dominion of Canada. This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the new self-governing Dominion.

input: original question: What is the facility access of [Royal Montreal Golf Club]
answer: private
answer type: Golf Facility Access.
auxiliary information: 'The Royal Montreal Golf Club' is the oldest golf club in North America, founded 142 years ago in 1873. On the 4th day of November 1873, in the youthful but growing port city of Montreal, a small group of eight gentlemen sat in a dockside office and formed the Montreal Golf Club. This was the first effort to place golf on an organized basis, not only in Canada but in North America and it is, therefore, the oldest golf club in continuous existence on the continent. Eleven years later, in 1884, permission was granted by Queen Victoria to use the ""Royal"" prefix. The first golf course was a 9-hole layout on Fletcher's Field, part of Mount Royal Park, which was shared by the red-coated golfers and other citizens relaxing in what was then the outskirts of Montreal. The first female member, Mrs. William Wallis Watson, was elected in 1891 - the first woman of any golf club in North America. With her election, began the Ladies' Branch of the Royal Montreal Golf Club. In 1899, the Ladies moved into their own clubhouse at Dixie. In 1896, the club had moved to Dixie, in the parish of Dorval, where it remained until the pressures of urban growth again dictated a decision to move.
