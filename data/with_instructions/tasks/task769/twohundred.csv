input: In physical cosmology , Big Bang nucleosynthesis ( abbreviated BBN , also known as primordial nucleosynthesis , arch ( a ) eonucleosynthesis , archonucleosynthesis , protonucleosynthesis and pal ( a ) eonucleosynthesis ) refers to the production of nuclei other than those of the lightest isotope of hydrogen ( hydrogen - 1 , H , having a single proton as a nucleus ) during the early phases of the Universe . Primordial nucleosynthesis is believed by most cosmologists to have taken place in the interval from roughly 10 seconds to 20 minutes after the Big Bang , and is calculated to be responsible for the formation of most of the universe 's helium as the isotope helium - 4 ( He ) , along with small amounts of the hydrogen isotope deuterium ( H or D ) , the helium isotope helium - 3 ( He ) , and a very small amount of the lithium isotope lithium - 7 ( Li ) . In addition to these stable nuclei , two unstable or radioactive isotopes were also produced : the heavy hydrogen isotope tritium ( H or T ) ; and the beryllium isotope beryllium - 7 ( Be ) ; but these unstable isotopes later decayed into He and Li , as above .

input: Gothic fiction , which is largely known by the subgenre of Gothic horror , is a genre or mode of literature and film that combines fiction and horror , death , and at times romance . Its origin is attributed to English author Horace Walpole , with his 1764 novel The Castle of Otranto , subtitled ( in its second edition ) `` A Gothic Story '' . The effect of Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of terror , an extension of Romantic literary pleasures that were relatively new at the time of Walpole 's novel . It originated in England in the second half of the 18th century where , following Walpole , it was further developed by Clara Reeve , Ann Radcliffe , William Thomas Beckford and Matthew Lewis . The genre had much success in the 19th century , as witnessed in prose by Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein and the works of Edgar Allan Poe as well as Charles Dickens with his novella , A Christmas Carol , and in poetry in the work of Samuel Taylor Coleridge , Lord Byron and Poe . Another well known novel in this genre , dating from the late Victorian era , is Bram Stoker 's Dracula . The name Gothic refers to the ( pseudo ) - medieval buildings , emulating Gothic architecture , in which many of these stories take place . This extreme form of romanticism was very popular in England and Germany . The English Gothic novel also led to new novel types such as the German Schauerroman and the French Georgia .

Even though he has been `` Ranger of the Month '' at Brickleberry for several years , he does not appear to display good skills or even common sense . Steve 's `` Ranger of the Month '' title means everything to him and he will do anything to keep it . Despite his extreme lack of intelligence , he knows the Brickleberry park very well because his father was also a Brickleberry ranger , so Steve was raised in the park . He dreamed of working at Brickleberry since he was a child in order to follow in his father 's footsteps . He is shown to have a man crush on Viggo Mortensen . Woodrow `` Woody '' Johnson ( voiced by Tom Kenny ) -- Woody is a 55 - year - old , abrasive ranger with a military background . In the `` Crippleberry '' episode , he mentions to Steve that he is technically a war criminal . He worked his way up to head ranger over his 30 - year career at Brickleberry . He worked alongside Steve 's father , but never searched for him when Jonah went missing . He always has the park 's best interest in mind and struggles to boost the dwindling tourism numbers by any means . In `` 2 Weeks Notice '' , he accidentally confesses to Malloy that when his mother died , his father forced him to dress up in her lingerie , implying that he may have been sexually abused by his father . It is also revealed in season 2 that Woody was a former porn star named Rex Erection . Ethel Anderson ( voiced by Kaitlin Olson in season 1 , Natasha Leggero in season 2 and 3 ) -- Ethel is an attractive , 25 - year - old female ranger . She was the top ranger at Yellowstone and was transferred to Brickleberry in an effort to get the park back on track ( and because she was fired from Yellowstone for being drunk on the job ) . She is passionate for animals and nature and does her best to treat her co-workers kindly . Steve sees Ethel as a threat to his Ranger of the Month title , while Ethel sees Steve as a bumbling idiot . Ethel possesses extraordinary ranger skills , but is much more humble than Steve . Denzel Jackson ( voiced by Jerry Minor ) -- Denzel is a black ranger who is horrible at his job , but ca n't be fired because he works for a government agency . Denzel is a gerontophile , which occasionally gets him into hot water . Denzel finds his job challenging because he 's afraid of bugs , snakes , and pretty much anything else that inhabits the woods . It was revealed in the first season that his father and father 's father and grandfather 's father were undercover cops , but Denzel has no interest in following in their footsteps . For the rest of the series it is not mentioned again . Connie Cunaman ( voiced by Roger Black ) -- Connie is a lesbian female ranger who has a large body , immense strength , and a deep voice that is often mistaken for a male . In `` Gay Bomb '' , Connie admits she is a lesbian and it is revealed to the viewers that her strength is dubbed by her as `` lesbian strength '' . Connie is capable of lifting massive objects , such as trees , bears , and even a real bomb . She is obsessed with Ethel and was turned away by her Evangelical parents for being a homosexual . On a side note , when Connie gets excited , her vagina makes growling noises similar to that of a stomach , requiring her to talk it down like a wild animal . Malloy ( voiced by Daniel Tosh ) -- Malloy is the last surviving member of his species Ursus loquacious that Woody has taken in and spoiled after Steve accidentally ran over and shot his parents , telling him a tourist did it . Woody lets him play video games all day and eat junk food . Malloy is very crude , racist , sexist , has a superiority complex , and in some ways is a narcissist . He openly hates the rangers and in addition , he enjoys putting them down and messing with them on a daily basis , especially Steve .

input: In 1996 , Funimation Productions licensed Dragon Ball Z for an English - language release in North America . They contracted Saban Entertainment to help distribute the series to television , and Pioneer Entertainment to handle home video distribution . The Vancouver - based Ocean Studios were hired by Funimation to dub the anime ( Funimation had previously used the Ocean voice cast in their short - lived 1995 dub of Dragon Ball ) . Saban musicians Ron Wasserman and Jeremy Sweet , known for their work on the Power Rangers franchise , composed a new background score and theme song ( nicknamed `` Rock the Dragon '' ) . Funimation 's initial English dub of Dragon Ball Z had mandated cuts to content and length , which reduced the first 67 episodes into 53 . It premiered in the United States on September 13 , 1996 in first - run syndication , but halted production in 1998 after two seasons . This was due to Saban scaling down its syndication operations , in order to focus on producing original material for the Fox Kids block . Pioneer also ceased its home video release of the series at volume 17 ( the end of the dub ) and retained the rights to produce an uncut subtitled version , but did not do so .

input: The modern Oval Office was built at the West Wing 's southeast corner , offering FDR , who was physically disabled and used a wheelchair , more privacy and easier access to the Residence . He and Gugler devised a room architecturally grander than the previous two rooms , with more robust Georgian details : doors topped with substantial pediments , bookcases set into niches , a deep bracketed cornice , and a ceiling medallion of the Presidential Seal . Rather than a chandelier or ceiling fixture , the room is illuminated by light bulbs hidden within the cornice that `` wash '' the ceiling in light . In small ways , hints of Art Moderne can be seen , in the sconces flanking the windows and the representation of the eagle in the ceiling medallion . FDR and Gugler worked closely together , often over breakfast , with Gugler sketching the president 's ideas . One notion resulting from these sketches that has become fixed in the layout of the room 's furniture , is that of two high back chairs in front of the fireplace . The public sees this most often with the president seated on the left , and a visiting head of state on the right . This allowed FDR to be seated , with his guests at the same level , de-emphasizing his inability to stand . Construction of the modern Oval Office was completed in 1934 .

input: Vesicoureteral reflux ( VUR ) , also known as vesicoureteric reflux , is a condition in which urine flows retrograde , or backward , from the bladder into the ureters / kidneys . Urine normally travels in one direction ( forward , or anterograde ) from the kidneys to the bladder via the ureters , with a 1 - way valve at the vesicoureteral ( ureteral - bladder ) junction preventing backflow . The valve is formed by oblique tunneling of the distal ureter through the wall of the bladder , creating a short length of ureter ( 1 -- 2 cm ) that can be compressed as the bladder fills . Reflux occurs if the ureter enters the bladder without sufficient tunneling , i.e. , too `` end - on '' .

The story , set in an unnamed Italian city at carnival time in an unspecified year , is about a man taking fatal revenge on a friend who , he believes , has insulted him . Like several of Poe 's stories , and in keeping with the 19th - century fascination with the subject , the narrative revolves around a person being buried alive -- in this case , by immurement . As in `` The Black Cat '' and `` The Tell - Tale Heart '' , Poe conveys the story from the murderer 's perspective .
