input: The long bones are those that are longer than they are wide . They are one of five types of bones : long , short , flat , irregular and sesamoid . Long bones , especially the femur and tibia , are subjected to most of the load during daily activities and they are crucial for skeletal mobility . They grow primarily by elongation of the diaphysis , with an epiphysis at each end of the growing bone . The ends of epiphyses are covered with hyaline cartilage ( `` articular cartilage '' ) .
