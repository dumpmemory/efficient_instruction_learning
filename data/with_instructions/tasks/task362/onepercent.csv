"Definition: ""Yes, and"" is a rule-of-thumb in improvisational comedy that suggests that a participant in a dialogue should accept what another participant has stated (""Yes"") and then expand on that line of thought or context (""and...""). Given a prompt and two responses, identify which response is the type of ""yes, and"". Indicate your answer by 'Response 1' if the first response is correct, otherwise 'Response 2'.  Note that a ""Yes, and"" does not require someone explicitly saying 'yes, and...' as part of a dialogue exchange.
