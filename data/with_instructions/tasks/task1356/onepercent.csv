input: But Eluned Morgan conceded that it would be ""difficult for us to stop"" from a legal point of view. Her comments were criticised by a Labour AM. Alun Davies said threatening legal action ""sounds like the last breath before you're thrown out of the pub"". Mr Davies said he was not convinced the Welsh Government would ""have a leg to stand on"" in trying to shape international trade deals after Brexit. Following Donald Trump's comments during last week's trade visit that the NHS would be ""on the table"" in any future trade talks between the UK and the USA, Eluned Morgan said there was ""absolutely no prospect whatsoever of us allowing the Welsh NHS to be part of any negotiation."" The US President then rowed back on his initial comments following criticism from a number of MPs. Asked about her response to President Trump's remarks as she gave evidence to the Assembly's Brexit committee on Monday, Ms Morgan said ""legally, it would be difficult for us to stop because we don't have a veto over trade"".

input: The device will be marketed in partnership with the local internet retail giant JD.com. The team behind the Nokia 6 phone said the handset's ""premium design"" would appeal to the local market. The announcement coincided with the final day of the CES tech show in Las Vegas, where other new mobile phones and gadgets have been launched. Nokia no longer manufactures phones that carry its name but has instead licensed its brand to another Finnish company, HMD Global. Until now, the only phones that had been released under the deal had been more basic ""feature phone"" models. The Android device had been highly anticipated and marks Nokia's return to the smartphone market after a series of Windows Phone models. Nokia also briefly sold Android-based handsets - known as Nokia X - in 2014. Microsoft used Nokia's brand for a short time after buying the company's mobile devices the same year, but later referred to the devices solely by their Lumia name. Mobile World Congress Nokia once dominated the mobile phone market but struggled after the launch of the iPhone a decade ago, and the subsequent release of Google's Android operating system. HMD Global had previously indicated it would release several Nokia-branded Android phones in 2017. It is expected to provide details of at least some of the other launches at another trade show - Barcelona's Mobile World Congress - in February. ""The decision by HMD to launch its first Android smartphone into China is a reflection of the desire to meet the real world needs of consumers in different markets around the world,"" the firm said in a statement. ""With over 552 million smartphone users in China in 2016, a figure that is predicted to grow to more than 593 million users by 2017, it is a strategically important market where premium design and quality is highly valued by consumers."" The Nokia 6 phone runs Android 7.0 - the latest version, also known as Nougat - and features: The specifications are mid-range, and so is the price: 1,699 yuan ($245; Â£200). That makes it slightly more expensive than Huawei's Honor 6X but cheaper than Xiaomi's Mi 5s. ""Nokia remains one of the most recognised mobile phone brands on the planet,"" commented Ben Wood from the CCS Insight technology consultancy. ""HMD Global will be hoping it can capitalise on this as it seeks to relaunch Nokia devices in 2017. ""It will be hoping the brand will help it stand out in the incredibly crowded Android smartphone market, which is characterised by cut-throat competition and a sea of design sameness. "" Brandon Ackroyd, Head of Customer Insight at Tiger Mobiles believes that Nokia will launch the Nokia 6 globally if the device has a successful launch in Asia. ""If the Nokia 6 performs well in China then it's highly likely we will see a new international variant of the handset sometime in 2017. We'll be keeping our eyes on the certification websites in the coming months looking for a variant with more connectivity options like GSM, LTE, and CDMA that will make the device compatible with networks worldwide.""

input: President Donald Trump said Mr Mnuchin had spent his career making money in the private sector and would now work for the taxpayer. Mr Mnuchin pledged to create jobs and combat terrorist financing. Democrats had argued that Mr Mnuchin had made a fortune foreclosing on families during the financial crisis. The top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, Maxine Waters of California, called Mr Mnuchin ""the foreclosure king"". His critics have also questioned whether he is too close to the Wall Street banking community, which he will be responsible for regulating. Democrats also complained that Mr Mnuchin had failed to disclose nearly $100m (Â£79m) in assets when he filed with the Senate Finance Committee. Mr Mnuchin spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before becoming a hedge fund manager. He later founded a film production company that was behind such box office hits as the X-Men franchise and American Sniper. Mr Trump said Mr Mnuchin would help make the US a ""jobs magnet"". ""He'll work 24 hours a day, I know him. He'll work 28 hours a day if they give him the extra four hours,"" he said. Another former Goldman executive, Gary Cohn, is the director of President Trump's National Economic Council. What do we know about the new treasury secretary's policy plans? Mr Mnuchin hasn't announced a fully fledged plan, but his responses in media interviews and during the Senate debate over his appointment make clear some of his priorities: There are still many policy areas that have not been addressed, including how he will approach trading relations with China, Mexico and other partners.

input: The competition will be held at the Perthshire resort in 2014, the first time it has been held on Scottish soil almost 40 years. Aberdonian golfer Paul Lawrie handed the trophy over to Gleneagles Chief Executive Patrick Elsmie to mark the countdown to the event. Scotland's economy is expected benefit by Â£100m by hosting the Ryder Cup. Lawrie, who played a key role in helping the European team to retain the Ryder Cup at Medinah at the weekend, made the stop at Gleneagles before making his way to St Andrew's for the Dunhill Links Championship which begins on Thursday. Spurring event He said was delighted to see the cup return to Scotland: ""This is the home of golf and it somehow feels right to be taking the trophy, and all it represents, to Gleneagles. ""I have never experienced anything like that final day in Medinah, but being involved has spurred me on to hopefully play a part in Team Europe at Gleneagles 2014. ""It will be a really special event and I hope I can do enough to be in contention."" Patrick Elsmie, managing director of Gleneagles, said it was an honour to host the Ryder Cup: ""The Medinah Country Club set an incredibly high bar in hosting a truly memorable Ryder Cup, but the scenes in Chicago also demonstrated just why we were so keen to host this amazing sporting event. ""Seeing the trophy here at Gleneagles today brings home the fact that it's Scotland's turn next, and that the countdown to the 2014 Matches has begun. ""It is going to be a wonderful time for Scotland, and we at Gleneagles will ensure the tradition, class and theatre of The Ryder Cup are celebrated in style."" Economic boost The event is expected to be one of the largest ever hosted in the country with the Scottish government spending about Â£20m to stage the match. It is anticipated that over the week of the competition an additional Â£100 million will come into the Scottish economy. About 250,000 people are expected to travel to Perthshire to attend the event, with an estimated half a billion households watching it on television. Ryder Cup Director Richard Hills said: ""Medinah was epic and has given Scotland a real taste of what to expect in two years' time. Bringing the trophy back to the Home of Golf is the perfect way to continue Team Europe's celebrations."" First Minister Alex Salmond said the arrival of the cup meant that the countdown to the 2014 tournament had begun. Increased expectations Mr Salmond said: ""The Ryder Cup is going to bring enormous economic benefits to Scotland. ""Before last weekend in Medinah it was estimated that 2014 would pump Â£100m into the local and wider Scottish economy during the tournament week alone. ""However, last weekend showed us that the Ryder Cup continues to grow in scale tournament-by-tournament. Scotland's Ryder Cup in 2014 is now likely to be even bigger than we have anticipated up to now.""

input: The proposals are designed to replace a current grass pitch on the Crichton Estate in Dumfries. The Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland has voiced concerns about the impact on the landscape. However, planning officers say that is outweighed by the potential economic and community benefits. The Â£410,000 scheme is a joint project between Dumfries and Galloway College, Dumfries and Galloway Council and the Crichton Development Company. It has received grant support from Sport Scotland. If the scheme receives planning permission a new pitch, fencing and floodlights would be built at Hospital Park, the home ground of South of Scotland League side Crichton FC.

input: Fox wants to buy the 61% of Sky it does not already own. But it faces regulatory problems after the Competition and Markets Authority found the Â£11.7bn deal was not in the public interest. Fox had already pledged to ensure the independence of Sky News. The Murdoch family's news outlets are currently consumed by nearly a third of the UK's population across TV, radio, online and newspapers. The Murdoch Family Trust controls News Corporation, which publishes newspapers including the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times. Sky was the top gainer on the FTSE 100 in early afternoon trading on Tuesday, with shares up about 2%. What is the ring-fencing proposal? Under the proposed new deal, the news channel would become a distinct company within Sky, run by the head of Sky News. Funding for Sky News would also be guaranteed for 15 years. Previously, Fox had said it would be funded for 10 years. The executive chairmen of Sky, Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, and the chief executive, Chase Carey, would not try to influence editorial decisions made by the head of Sky News, according to a statement by 21st Century Fox. The company had already proposed remedies to the CMA's concerns, including having an independent board for Sky News. However, critics of that proposal, including politicians such as Ed Miliband, Vince Cable and Kenneth Clarke, had said that the head of Sky News would still be appointed by the head of 21st Century Fox and so could be influenced by the Murdochs. Fox hit back at those politicians on Tuesday, saying their assertions were ""unsupported and fanciful"". What is the new Disney proposal? Fox also proposed selling off Sky News to Disney, whether or not Disney's proposed acquisition of Fox goes through. Disney's proposed takeover of 21st Century Fox, which has yet to be approved by regulators, includes Fox's current 39% stake in Sky. Even if that takeover gets knocked back, Sky News would still be sold off under the new proposal. Disney chief executive Bob Iger is keen on Sky and has said he is ""committed"" to Sky News, which is loss-making. US media giant Comcast has also thrown its hat into the ring for Sky with a Â£22.1bn bid in February. Comcast has a broadband division serving 29 million US customers. It also owns NBC and Universal Pictures and wants to buy a majority stake in Sky. What do Sky shareholders think of the proposals? Analysis: Simon Jack, business editor This is great news for Sky shareholders. If Sky News is sold to Disney or legally separated from the rest of Sky, then the thorny issue of Murdoch control over Sky News - to add to the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times - is finally laid to rest. What we will then have is a straight shoot out between 21st Century Fox and US rival Comcast to acquire Sky. A proper auction between those two bidders will mean a higher price for Sky. Currently Fox is offering Â£10.75 per share and Comcast has indicated it would be prepared to bid Â£12.50. Directors at Sky are pretty confident that Fox will have to come in with a better offer. At that point, we will see how serious Comcast really is in its bid to derail Rupert Murdoch's carefully laid plans to sell Fox to Disney and effectively dismantle a media empire it has taken a lifetime to build.

input: The victim, named locally as Ozell Pemberton, 16, was found injured at about 15:30 BST on Thursday at Lower Parade in the main shopping area of Sutton Coldfield, north of Birmingham. West Midlands Police said the suspect handed himself into a police station in the early hours and remains in custody. The attack reportedly took place near a McDonald's and a group of bus stops. Police said there had been disorder in the area at the time and several people were seen fleeing. The ambulance service said despite its ""tremendous efforts"", Ozell was confirmed dead at the scene. Police said he has has not yet been formally identified and a post-mortem examination will be held in due course. But a tribute to Ozell was released by his former school earlier. ""We were deeply saddened to hear about the tragic death of one of our former pupils and our thoughts and prayers are with his family,"" a spokesperson for Greenwood Academy, Castle Vale, said. ""For our part, we are providing counselling and support to our pupils and staff to help them through this difficult time."" Staff said he last attended the school in November 2015. Councillor David Pears, who represents the Sutton Trinity ward, described the violence as ""appalling"". He added: ""My sympathies go out to this person's family and their friends. ""I think people want to feel safe; it's really important that police take action very quickly."" Analysis by Sima Kotecha, BBC Midlands correspondent Unfortunately fatal stabbings in Birmingham are nothing new. This crime happened in the affluent area of Sutton Coldfield and in the middle of the afternoon. The age of the victim is also unnerving; just 16 and killed as a result of what officers call ""disorder"" involving several people. At a time when police resources are stretched in the region and crime rates are soaring, there is a palpable fear among some residents who are repeatedly saying that they just don't feel safe anymore. That fear is particularly prevalent among the older generation, but the victims in many of these violent cases are young men and boys. @sima_kotecha Part of Lower Parade remains sealed off for investigations to be carried out. West Midlands Police Assistant Chief Constable, Alex Murray, said: ""This is a tragic set of circumstances and our thoughts, and I'm sure the thoughts of everyone in the community, are with the boy's family at this truly devastating time. ""A dedicated team of homicide detectives has worked non-stop on the investigation since yesterday and has made good progress."" Mr Murray added: ""We need parents, community leaders, schools and young people themselves to pass the message that it is never OK to carry or use a knife."" David Jamieson, the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, said ""much more needs to be done"". ""This is another stark reminder of the importance and responsibility we all have in ending violence in our communities,"" he said. Mr Jamieson said he was spending an extra Â£2m ""tackling violence"" over the next two years. Knife crime in the West Midlands Source: West Midlands Police Related Internet Links West Midlands Police

input: Muller said ""an unprecedented 25% surge"" in farm milk production since 2014 meant supply was now ""substantially"" outstripping demand. A month-long review with its 230 Scottish suppliers concluded that the situation was ""unviable"". It will now give 14 dairy farms in Aberdeenshire 12 months' notice. Muller said the suppliers were based in areas which presented ""heightened or complex logistical transport challenges"" for the company. In a statement, the milk processor also announced plans to introduce a tiered transport charge for suppliers in Scotland from February. Muller had warned its suppliers that the growing milk surplus was not sustainable and had ""significant environmental consequences."" It said surplus milk was currently being transported to England, resulting in more than 6,000 tanker movements travelling a total of 2.5 million miles each year. Rob Hutchison, from Muller Milk and Ingredients, said: ""We fully appreciate that these measures will be extremely unwelcome and destabilising for our farmer suppliers particularly in the north east of Scotland, but the current situation is unviable and we must act. ""We completed the largest single investment in fresh milk processing in Scotland in more than a decade at our dairy in Bellshill last year and we will continue to do what we can to stimulate new demand for fresh milk. ""But with fresh milk already in 96% of the nation's fridges and overall consumer demand for the product in marginal decline, the reality is that it is extremely unlikely that this sector will soak up the heightened levels of milk production from farms which we have seen."" 'Devastating news' Commenting on the announcement, NFU Scotland president Andrew McCornick said it was ""clearly devastating news"". He added: ""Given the considerable commitment and investment made by dairy farmers, we now have producers looking to find a new buyer in the next year if they wish to continue milking cows while others, through haulage charges, face a significant cut in income at a time when milk prices are struggling to cover the cost of production."" Last month, Muller announced the closure of its Aberdeen depot with the loss of up to 45 jobs. Muller's distribution, garage, tanker and retail operations in the city had been the focus of a 30-day consultation process. The company said the decision was ""against a backdrop of declining consumption of fresh milk and significant changes in retailing"".

input: Half of those consulted by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said patient care was compromised by insufficient staffing on their most recent shift. The claims emerged in a submission to Holyrood's health committee on the 2018/19 draft budget. The Scottish government said the number of nurses and midwives had significantly increased since 2012. It is also committed to increasing the number of training places for health care workers, Health Secretary Shona Robison added. However the report is the latest in a series of warnings over staffing issues in Scotland's health service. The RCN's submission was based on the preliminary results of a survey of 3,300 nurses and health care support workers from across Scotland. Of those who said high quality care had been affected by staff shortages, a third said there were not enough registered nurses. A quarter said there were inadequate numbers of health care support workers and nearly half had concerns about the mix of skills on their last shift. Other findings include: The RCN used their report to call for more support for the healthcare workforce. It said: ""There needs to be recognition of the fact that people are the NHS' greatest resource and that investment in workforce will have a positive impact for patients, as well as seeing improvements in areas like sickness rates and retention."" And it added: ""The RCN recognises the Scottish government's commitment to scrapping the 1% pay cap for NHS staff, but unless staff are appropriately remunerated, as well as being given the time and support to develop, issues around recruitment and retention within nursing teams will persist."" The RCN will publish more detailed analysis of the survey results later in the summer. 'Damning insight' The findings have led to further claims that morale among health care staff is at ""rock bottom"" and nurses are being ""stretched to breaking point"". Scottish Labour health spokesman Anas Sarwar said: ""This is a deeply worrying revelation. ""It reinforces our warnings that the SNP has presided over a workforce crisis in our NHS, leaving staff over-worked, under-valued and under-resourced. ""Morale is at rock bottom in the health service, with staff reporting there simply aren't enough of them to do the job properly. That risks compromising patient safety. ""This is part of the legacy left by Nicola Sturgeon who as health secretary slashed the number of training places for nurses and midwives. ""As a result, spending on agency nurses in Scotland has risen six-fold in just five years under the SNP, which is just one reason why our health service is in desperate need for a meaningful workforce plan."" Serious concerns Alex Cole-Hamilton, the Scottish Liberal Democrat's health spokesman, described it as a ""damning insight"" into the state of Scotland's NHS. He added: ""Our nurses within the NHS work incredibly hard but it is clear they are being stretched to breaking point. ""The SNP need to step in immediately and make sure that our wards are fully staffed. ""That starts by scrapping the NHS pay cap and give staff the resources and support they need to do their jobs. "" The Scottish Conservative's Miles Briggs said hospitals were being hit by the SNP government's ""horrendous lack of forward planning"". ""This is more damning evidence of that mismanagement, and it comes from those who know best,"" he added. ""We have warned the Scottish government for years that there aren't enough nurses working currently, and there aren't enough coming through the system. ""This falls completely on the SNP's head, and it must act swiftly to address these very serious concerns."" 'Safe staffing' Shona Robison, the cabinet secretary for health, defended the government's record. She said: ""There are over 3,300 more whole time equivalent nursing and midwifery staff working in our NHS compared to five years ago. This year we have also increased nursing and midwifery training places by 4.7%, bringing the total number of places available in 2017-18 to 3,360. ""For the last five years, this government has made consecutive increases to the number of student nurse training places. ""We're working with health boards to reduce the overall use of agency staff, including by establishing regional and national staff banks - which allows health boards greater access to a pool of highly-skilled, flexible NHS staff.

input: Glendon Spence and his friends sought refuge at the Marcus Lipton Youth Centre in Brixton on 21 February when two men armed with knives ran at them. The Old Bailey heard the 23-year-old was fatally stabbed in the thigh when he tripped and fell. The defendants, aged 17 and 18, both deny murder. The 17-year-old, who is alleged to have stabbed Mr Spence and cannot be named because of his age, denies being at the scene. Chibuzo Ukonu, of Loughton, Essex, admitted being present and in possession of a knife but denies intending to harm anyone or causing any injuries to Mr Spence. Jurors were told the attack, which happened at about 18:45 GMT, was captured on CCTV. They heard the defendants had been dropped off by a BMW Series 5 car which had been bought by Mr Ukonu days before. Prosecutor Julian Evans said: ""Glendon ran into the main room and headed towards the far end. ""As he ran, he lost his footing and fell to the ground. He managed to get up but he fell over again near to the corner of the main room close to a table tennis table."" He said as Mr Spence lay on the floor, the 17-year-old stabbed him in his right thigh, which caused ""sudden and immediate blood loss"". 'Flight to Uganda' As the attackers ran back to the waiting car Mr Spence was able to get to his feet but collapsed again, the court heard. He died at the scene at about 19:30. Later that night, the BMW car was found fire-damaged and abandoned on the Peabody Estate in south London, jurors heard. Mr Ukonu took a coach to Manchester the next day while his co-accused was arrested as he attempted to take a flight to Uganda from Heathrow Airport, the court was told. The trial continues.

input: By Ross HawkinsPolitical correspondent, BBC News Remember the councillor who thought Hitler was the greatest man in history? Remember the candidate who suggested asking the so-called Islamic State why it wasn't attacking Israel? Remember the student who said a large part of the Oxford University Labour Club had a ""problem with Jews""? Imagine the reaction, Jewish figures say, if these were stories about any other minority. They appear with politically damaging regularity. Now, though, it seems change will come. Activists and MPs have told BBC Radio 4's Today programme they are trying to toughen the rules on anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and racism. Even if they fail, I'm told a party review by Labour peer Lady Royall into allegations of anti-Semitism may well also suggest rewriting the rulebook. Poisonous atmosphere That is highly unlikely to be the end of this story, though, because it goes to the heart of a poisonous atmosphere in parts of the Labour movement. Jeremy Corbyn's critics - who are many and vociferous - put the blame at his door. It is he, they say, who has attracted new members with these views, who has condemned anti-Semitism but not acted and who has - on occasion - made what they think are utterly inadequate responses to offensive language. Their concerns are fundamental - they simply don't believe anyone who describes the Palestinian militant group Hamas as a friend wants to tackle this issue. On the other side, his supporters remind us of those condemnations of anti-Semitism and the decision to launch an inquiry, and point out this is not a new problem. Lost in the fury about a member suspended then readmitted after anti-Semitic comments only to become vice-chair of her local party, was the fact those decisions were made not under Mr Corbyn, but his predecessor Ed Miliband. No Labour leader could be expected to vet the thousands of new members who have signed up. For some fighting Mr Corbyn's corner, this issue is serious and real, but is also being used as a stick to beat him by his internal political enemies. There are those who have long seen allegations of anti-Semitism as attempts to silence legitimate criticism of Israel - on which different wings of the Labour movement take passionately opposing views. The political debate, then, is not at heart merely a row about rules or party management, but fundamental differences within Labour. Changing the rulebook will not necessarily change what people say or write, merely how they are dealt with. It certainly won't change how people feel, and there are plenty in Labour who seek no part in its civil wars but wonder why anti-Semites choose to join their party.

The service was held at Maksymilian Kolbe Church, on Gordon Road - the church Mrs Kaczan was walking to at the time of the bag snatch. Arthur Waszkiewicz, from west London, has denied manslaughter and robbery. Mrs Kaczan, who was born in Poland, came to the UK after escaping a Nazi prison camp during World War Two. Although she has no remaining family, friends said her death had left a big impression on those who knew her and the local community. The service was spoken mostly in Polish with an English-translated leaflet. In an English language eulogy, her friend Anna Zimand, said: ""The horrors she saw and the conditions she had to endure are indescribable. ""That she was able to survive shows what strength of character she had."" Ms Zimand said Mrs Kaczan was ""remarkably active"" and was ""such a staunch supporter"" of her local Polish church. She said she received congratulations from the Pope for her 100th birthday, which she celebrated with friends. ""She was still looking forward to her life and whatever milestones were yet to come,"" she said. ""Zofija's spirit is present here and I know that she would be so touched by the kindness... the prayers. ""She would have wanted to say thank you to the people who cared for her... and all of you who have come to pay your respects."" Mr Waszkiewicz, 39, of Hilary Road, Shepherds Bush, will stand trial on 3 December at Derby Crown Court. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

input: Many villagers are already cut off by floods and Somerset County Council said its priority was to keep people safe. Sedgemoor District Council has made the same announcement so it can also mobilise extra support. The area's MP said there was a risk of catastrophic flooding unless action was taken and he asked for government help. A major incident is declared where there is a situation which could not be dealt with easily by the local council and could threaten lives, disrupt the community or damage property. It means the local authority can organise emergency evacuations, set up rest centres and mobilise voluntary organisations. He said there were fears that rain at the weekend could cause problems for Langport and Westonzoyland. The Met Office has issued an amber warning for rain on Sunday saying people living on the Somerset Levels should ""be prepared for further flooding"". Somerset County Council said its decision to declare a major incident followed the forecasts of further heavy rain, coupled with high spring tides next week. Ian Liddell-Grainger, the Conservative MP for Bridgwater, said the county faced a ""very difficult weekend"". He has written to Prime Minster David Cameron and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles asking for help. ""There is a very real risk of catastrophic flooding on a scale not seen for more than a century unless we act swiftly and decisively,"" he said. ""I have told the prime minister we need extra pumping capacity brought here as soon as possible and we may also need help from the military if the situation progresses in the way it appears to be going."" 'Urgent situation' Deputy chief executive of Somerset County Council Pat Flaherty said: ""Our priority has to be to keep people safe. ""We are doing everything we can to do this and we believe that declaring a major incident shows just how urgent the situation is for many of our residents and communities."" The council said it will continue its current help and support for people affected by flooding, including providing a boat service for the cut-off community of Muchelney and Thorney. It will also be providing a pontoon bridge at Langport and supporting farmers providing a vital tractor service to communities. Kerry Rickards, of Sedgemoor District Council, said: ""Several Sedgemoor communities have been severely affected by the floodwaters for some weeks now. ""With significant rainfall expected over the coming days we feel this situation needs to be escalated as a major incident."" Sedgemoor District Council said it had dealt with two major incidents before, one in 2011 when a river wall partially collapsed in Bridgwater, leading to the evacuation of nearby homes and 19 people spending the night in emergency accommodation. It said the second incident was in 2012 when homes were evacuated in Burnham-on-Sea after police found highly-explosive chemicals in a man's shed. For this incident, it has provided portable toilets where septic tanks have overflowed and delivered extra sandbags on top of the 3,000 already given out. The village of Muchelney in south Somerset has been cut off for almost a month. A pontoon has been built there to help villagers board a boat which has been used for transport along flooded roads.

input: Leanne Wood needed second preference votes to be the party's number one candidate on the South Wales Central list for the 2016 assembly election. Labour called it ""embarrassing"". But Plaid deputy leader Elin Jones said Ms Wood's narrow victory over Cardiff councillor Neil McEvoy was simply due to a ""very competitive election"". As well as 40 constituency members, the assembly includes 20 AMs elected from five regional lists to give a more proportional result. Topping the South Wales Central regional list - as she did in 2011 - makes Ms Wood's re-election to the assembly more likely. 'Strong candidates' Sources say Mr McEvoy led after the first round of voting on Saturday, but was eventually runner-up to Ms Wood after members' second preferences were taken into account. Dafydd Trystan was chosen as third candidate on the list. Speaking at Plaid Cymru's weekly news conference in Cardiff Bay on Tuesday, Ms Jones denied any embarrassment for Ms Wood or the party at the way the candidates were selected. She said she ""wasn't surprised"" by the closeness of the result, adding that Ms Wood would be ""ably assisted by two very strong candidates in the second and third slots as well ... I feel and see and hear no unease with any of that"".

input: By Ian YoungsEntertainment & arts reporter Running an independent bookshop can be a challenge at the best of times, trying to compete with the might of Amazon and the supermarkets. In recent years, things had been looking up, however, with 890 on our high streets in 2019, up from 867 three years earlier. They took a major hit during lockdown, but most have reopened (except in Scotland) in time for Independent Bookshop Week, which runs until Saturday. Many found new ways to reach readers while their doors were shut, but their long-term futures are still in the balance. ""As yet we have no idea how many retail casualties may result from the crisis,"" said Meryl Halls, head of the Booksellers Association. 'We're still very far from out of the woods' Bookbugs and Dragon Tales in Norwich had only been open for seven months when it was forced to shut again. ""We hadn't factored a global pandemic into the business plan, surprisingly,"" owner Leanne Fridd laughs. She thought about getting a job in a supermarket when the virus struck, but decided to try to keep the business going, making the most of one thing an Amazon algorithm can't match - a personal touch. She put together home-school packs, bundling together educational, activity and story books based on each child's interests and age. She also created adult escape packs with a personalised selection of novels plus relaxing treats and mindful activities. She and husband Dan also made their online store more prominent and ran online storytelling sessions and book groups. ""When people are at home and the internet is just there, we are fully aware that people have an alternative, and potentially a cheaper alternative, and we can't possibly match that. No independent bookshop can,"" she says. ""All indies try and offer something that goes a little bit further. We know your children, we watch them grow, we care about your family. So we felt it was really important to say, 'We're still here for you', and people have been responding to that quite nicely."" Even so, turnover was only 20% of the pre-pandemic level. She furloughed both members of staff and wasn't eligible for the government's self-employment support. The shop reopened last week, with the necessary safety measures and reduced hours. In the afternoons, customers can book a 15-minute slot to have the shop to themselves, their bubble or family. ""They don't have to worry about social distancing from anyone apart from us, and we're obviously suited and booted,"" she says. ""That's been really effective because a lot of the families have said, 'This is the first time we've brought our children out, this is the first shop we've been into'."" The future is still uncertain, she says. ""We're still very far from out of the woods but the bigger fear was that we wouldn't be able to survive - and still is. But we try and be really optimistic and positive and do everything we can. ""If we don't survive, it won't be because we haven't poured our heart and soul into everything, trying so many different ways to help people feel engaged with us."" 'It couldn't have been timed worse' When lockdown was imposed, The Rabbit Hole in Brigg, Lincolnshire, didn't have an online shop to speak of, and decided it wasn't worth trying to create one at short notice. ""We concentrated on other things and just tried to get through,"" says Nick Webb, who runs the shop with wife Mel. ""We worked with a lot of authors and a lot of kids' groups doing Zoom sessions. We're heavily involved with schools - we're both ex-teachers - so every week we were doing that. It was another way that we kept in contact with people."" The authors who took part included Richard O'Neill, Katie Brosnan and Onjali Q Rauf. ""We try to improve the diversity of books that go out to kids, so it's not just what they see on - how shall I phrase this - big online retailers, and in the supermarkets,"" Webb explains. ""They all spent time talking to the kids on Zoom about books and illustrations - you name it, they talked about it. And it worked really well. ""And we don't know how it happened, but a little lad from South Korea joined. He asked his mum for permission, because it's midnight in South Korea when it's 4pm here."" Brigg is a market town, so The Rabbit Hole took over a stall when outdoor markets were allowed to reopen from 1 June, two weeks before the shop itself. The shop originally opened three years ago. The Webbs were not eligible for the government's self-employment support, which gives 80% of average monthly profits based on the past three years. The shop didn't make a profit for the first two years because they had spent money on the building and stock, Webb explains. When the shop shut in March, the couple couldn't be sure if it would open again. ""It's been really difficult, and now it's crossed fingers and let's hope we can rebuild it,"" he says. ""It was just the wrong time. It couldn't have been timed worse for us personally. ""It was very precarious and still is. We will just have to see how we go over the next few months. It will be close, but we're pretty determined."" 'The amount of work has been phenomenal' Linghams in Heswall, Merseyside, used to get around two-thirds of its income from events where authors would come and read and sell their books in person, owner Sue Porter estimates. When lockdown began, she came up with an idea to replicate that online, along with three other independent booksellers. The Facebook page for At Home with 4 Indies has so far hosted conversations with Marian Keyes, Joe Wicks and Ian Rankin, with sessions during Independent Bookshop Week culminating with Bernardine Evaristo on Friday. ""The amount of work that goes into it and getting everybody set up on tech and promoting it has been quite phenomenal to be honest,"" Porter says. ""But we have pulled it out of the bag. ""It was all about community - to make sure we could provide an hour of relief for our customers, and then if we managed to get the book, they would have several hours of relief after that away from the coronavirus."" They have struggled on occasion to get stock of an author's new book, and online sales have not matched the numbers that would normally be stacked on a shop counter. ""It doesn't compare,"" she says. ""It's a little bit more now, but we're miles away from how much we originally sold at our real-life events."" Having built up a following with their free online events, the four shops will start running paid-for author webcasts from September. Customers will get a ticket if they order the book. The four shop owners have been supporting each other the past three months. ""It has been hard, and it's been emotional,"" Porter says. ""If I was having a bad day, the other girls would get in touch with me and vice versa. The emotional struggle has been absolutely huge."" She furloughed her seven staff when lockdown was imposed, and reopened the shop on Monday, a week later than many places, because of work being done to the shop's cafe. ""I haven't had a day off since March when it [lockdown] started,"" she says. ""So I'm looking forward to getting some staff back and maybe taking my foot off the pedal.""

input: By James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent It has raised fears among MPs that the reduction could be permanent. There had been speculation the chancellor was proposing a temporary, one-off cut to help pay down the government's record deficit. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK is ""a leading, if not one of the leading, countries on aid"" and ""that will continue"". The idea behind a temporary cut was to reduce aid spending next year to just 0.5% of national income, down from the legally binding target of 0.7%. But the BBC understands that Rishi Sunak's reforms will require new legislation to be passed by Parliament, which MPs believe implies a permanent cut to the aid target or even its abolition. The issue is that the 0.7% baseline for Britain's aid budget is enshrined in law by the International Development (Official Development Assistance Target) Act. This does allow the government to miss the target in certain circumstances, such as if there is a substantial change in the country's national income. Foreign and Development Secretary Dominic Raab is simply required to lay a report before Parliament explaining why he has missed the target. But there is a growing belief at Westminster that this exemption can apply only retrospectively. The act places a duty on Mr Raab to ensure the 0.7% target is met. If he misses it, the act requires him to describe what steps he has taken to ensure the target is met the following year. Some MPs and charities believe these two provisions mean the government cannot declare in advance its intention to miss the target without breaking the law. To cut the aid budget without fresh legislation might lay the decision open to judicial review. MPs also believe that a one-off cut to the aid target - a saving of about Â£4bn - would hardly touch the sides of the Â£350bn deficit projected for this year. They say it only makes sense for the Treasury if the cut is permanent. They also believe that if the government is going to reduce aid spending and face significant political and international criticism, ministers will be tempted to go the whole hog and scrap the target entirely. Almost 200 charities, two former prime ministers, opposition parties, church leaders, ex-heads of the armed forces, global philanthropists have all come out against the cuts. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson not to go ahead with cuts, saying that ""helping the world's poorest is one of the great moral and ethical achievements of our country"". The risk for the government is that passing new legislation would give critics of the aid cut the chance to oppose and potentially block the changes in Parliament. Although the government has a working majority of more than 80, it has seen a number of rebellions of late. One senior Tory MP said defeating the government on this ""would be entirely doable"". Such is the scale of the reforms to the aid target that Mr Raab is expected to make a statement to MPs about it on Thursday.

Organiser Oz Osbourne said the group wanted to show the opposition to plans for the airport to cater for 12m passengers by the mid-2020s. He said he had not flown for 20 years and was urging other to take the ""flight-free pledge"" for 2020. ""If you join the flight-free pledge then it changes the way you think about who you are... and [you'll] have a greener lifestyle. An airport spokesman said flights ""were operating as normal"" but advised passengers to allow extra time for their journeys. It has submitted plans for the expansion and North Somerset Council is expected to decide on the expansion later this year.

input: By Gemma HandyZorg-En-Vlygt, Essequibo Coast, Guyana The bright welcoming venue, framed by rice paddies, looks the picture of pastoral contentment. But behind its creation lies an unsettling reality. This upbeat community centre was built to address the devastating number of suicides both here on the scenic Essequibo Coast - and in Guyana itself, which holds the dubious distinction of the highest suicide rate in the world. World Health Organization figures claim 44.2 in every 100,000 Guyanese take their own lives, compared to a global average of 16. Shining a light on suicide The Guyana Foundation, the charity behind the Sunrise Center in Zorg-En-Vlygt, has been integral in dragging the phenomenon into the national conversation in a country where stigma surrounding mental health issues has long hindered efforts to alleviate them. A lack of adequate mainstream facilities and woefully outdated legislation - which still defines patients as ""idiots"" suffering ""derangement"" - are just some of the obstacles, says the centre's managing director Anthony Autar. Attempted suicide is still technically illegal in Guyana, carrying a custodial sentence of two years, although measures are under way to decriminalise it. ""When considering mental health issues, we also look at people's ability to contribute to society,"" Mr Autar tells the BBC. ""Learning a skill like catering or floral arrangement can improve their sense of worth and outlook for the future."" Dress-making, tie-dye and yoga are also among the free courses open to the public at the facility which launched operations in June, ahead of its official October 29 opening. ""We often find people who come here are isolated and don't have many strong connections. We encourage students to build friendships with each other; those relationships can help save someone's life if they're feeling suicidal,"" Mr Autar adds. Attendees are routinely invited to complete questionnaires assessing their emotional wellbeing and are informed about the free counselling services offered. It's part of a proactive approach to tackle depression, anxiety and low self-esteem, and remove stigma by teaching people such feelings ""are as common as diabetes"", says counsellor Haimraj Hamandeo. Participants are predominantly aged 25 to 45, and 75% are female. ""Females are more open to assistance,"" Mr Hamandeo continues. ""They're also more likely to attempt suicide; men are more likely to be successful at it."" Opinion on just why Guyana tops the global suicide list is divided. A panel discussion organised by the University of Guyana to mark World Suicide Prevention Day in September cited relationship issues, political upheavals, poverty and high crime as contributory factors. Indo-Guyanese account for 80% of suicides, despite making up just 40% of the population in the six-race nation. Most are aged 15 to 34, with almost four men to each female. Poisoning by agricultural pesticides accounts for 65% of cases while one in five is by hanging. For each successful suicide, there's up to 25 more attempted cases, says Dr Bhiro Harry, head of psychiatry at Georgetown Public Hospital. ""Many Indo-Guyanese are farmers so they have easy access to lethal pesticides,"" he explains. ""Culturally, Indo-Guyanese folks are 'babied'. For example, I have three children in their 20s all living at home; I still make my son's breakfast every morning. Afro-Guyanese tend to have less close families and are taught to be strong and resilient."" Conversely, social science lecturer Paulette Henry thinks ""broken families"" is a prime cause. After being personally touched by suicide when a close friend killed himself, she testifies to the emotions affecting those left behind too. ""I dealt with anger, pain, a sense of loss and guilt,"" she says, ""as a social worker I felt I should have recognised the signs."" Public Health Minister Dr George Norton describes Guyana's existing national psychiatric hospital as ""not fit for human consumption"". He told the BBC mental health was his ""personal priority"" and that a national suicide prevention plan was currently being devised. That includes training additional psychiatrists and the creation of a psycho-social rehabilitation venue. Back at the Sunrise Center, Mr Hamandeo says engagement in ""productive"" activities had seen great successes. ""Often people find an ability they didn't know they had. You see a change in the way they communicate, the way they greet you, their extra energy."" That is music to the ears of centre founder Supriya Singh Bodden who must raise $3,500 (Â£2,850) a month from donations to run the facility - and plans to establish more across the country. ""I got so depressed reading about the suicides every day, I just wanted to bring some hope into communities suffering poverty and lack of opportunity,"" she explains. ""If we can touch people's lives in a positive way so they want to live to see another sunrise, then we have achieved something.""

The Prison Service said inmates in the affected wing have been transferred to other prisons. A spokeswoman said a ""full assessment"" of the 560-capacity Victorian jail would be carried out. Mobile phone footage subsequently emerged of inmates knocking through weak cell walls and rioting inside the Category B prison. It showed prisoners dancing and running around the walkways, with some holding batons and one squirting a hose. The Prison Service said 150 inmates, including 19 involved in the incident, have been transferred to other prisons. A spokeswoman said those involved would face prison adjudication hearings as well as an investigation by the police. ""We are taking action to improve and modernise our jails - just last week the prime minister announced up to Â£2.5bn to create 10,000 new prison places,"" she added. The MoJ previously confirmed that inmates broke out of their cells at the prison by ""manipulating weaknesses"" in the mortar with furniture. It said pepper spray was used to subdue two prisoners and four were taken to hospital.

input: By Celia HattonBBC News, Beijing Li Keqiang, the premier of China, faced that question as he delivered a lengthy speech marking the start of China's annual parliamentary session. At the heart of the speech: Beijing's forecast of 7% GDP growth in the coming year. Many other politicians would be thrilled to unveil that figure. But for China, it's a let-down after years of double digit expansion. So, how did Mr Li break the news? Very carefully, it seems. First, the state media spent weeks priming audiences to accept the ""new normal"" of slower economic growth. Moderate growth is a good thing, experts explained, because it indicates China is becoming a more mature, balanced economy. So, there was little surprise when Mr Li referenced the ""new normal"" when speaking about the coming year. The premier also took pains to show that he was in touch with the real problems facing the economy. Using plain-spoken language, in Chinese and in the official English translation, he admitted that investment was ""sluggish"" and the country's growth model was ""inefficient"". The government's work must be improved in many areas, he noted, conceding ""a small number of government employees behave irresponsibly, shocking cases of corruption still exist; and some government officials are neglectful of their duties."" With self-flagellation about the past out of the way, the premier turned to the future. He outlined ways that China's leaders are planning to restructure the economy by reducing price controls and overhauling the opaque tax system. Ten million new jobs will be created in China's cities, the premier promised, and the state would continue to fund ambitious stimulus projects. Few of the ideas outlined in the work report were new; but Li Keqiang reaffirmed the government's commitment to reform. Lastly, Mr Li made things easier for himself next year by warning that this slower rate of GDP growth would continue indefinitely. ""If China's economy can grow at this rate for a relatively long time,"" he explained, ""we will secure a more solid material foundation for modernisation."" In other words, the ""new normal"" shouldn't raise eyebrows next year.

If left to thrive, thousands of tiny plants can accumulate and starve the waterway of oxygen and sunlight. The trust is asking people to report any sightings of the weed, which is not harmful to humans. Recent sunshine has seen duck weed spread rapidly through the region's waterways and while each individual piece is tiny, it has left ""a thick carpet across the canal"", the trust said. Dogs and other animals have been known to mistake duck weed for grass ""and ended up in the water"", trust spokesman Diane Rollin said. Litter can also gather in the weed and cause problems for boats. Described as being ""like a garden lawn, pea soup, or even green porridge"", if left to flourish ""it can cause problems for other aquatic wildlife by starving it of oxygen and sunlight"", she said. Teams have cleared a mile-long section of the Lancaster Canal, between Hollinshead Fold Bridge and Ashton Basin, the trust said.

input: By Reevel AldersonBBC Scotland's social affairs correspondent A report said there was a big disparity between people in the most deprived areas compared to those in more affluent parts. Cancer charities called for more resources for deprived areas. The figures for the Detect Cancer Early (DCE) programme showed a small rise in the number of people diagnosed early. DCE was launched by the Scottish Government in 2012 to raise the public's awareness of the national cancer screening programmes and also the early signs and symptoms of cancer to encourage help to be sought earlier. Figures for the two years 2017 and 2018 showed that for the three most common forms of the disease - breast, lung and colorectal cancer - one in four (25.5%) was diagnosed at the earliest stage (stage 1). That was an increase of 9.4% in the seven years of the programme. Disparity However, the report highlighted the difference in experiences of people in poor areas and those in more affluent areas. Looking at the three most common cancers, 22.6% of those in the most deprived areas were diagnosed at stage 1 compared with 29.1% in the least deprived areas. Gordon Matheson of the charity Cancer Research UK said: ""It's welcome that DCE has seen a small increase in the number of people in Scotland being diagnosed early with cancer. ""However, it remains unacceptable that those living in Scotland's poorer communities have significantly less chance of being diagnosed at an early stage when treatment is more likely to be successful. ""For this to change it's essential we see more tailored resources being targeted at Scotland's poorer communities. ""The Scottish government must also ensure that there's enough staff to do this vital work, if we are to meet current and future need."" Over the seven years DCE has been in place there has been a rise in patients diagnosed at stage 1 with breast cancer - although there has been a small drop since 2014. The percentage of patients diagnosed at stage 1 for colorectal cancer has fallen over the time period although it has risen since 2016. Lung cancer has seen an increase in patients diagnosed at stage 1 although the increases have flattened over the last few years. Survival rates The report also showed for patients diagnosed with breast, colorectal or lung cancer in the most deprived areas of Scotland, the highest proportion were diagnosed at the most advanced stage of disease; stage 4 (29.7%). For those living in the least deprived areas, the highest proportion were diagnosed at stage 2 (29.6%). Scotland's Public Health Minister Joe FitzPatrick said early detection was crucial to continuing the improvement in survival rates with deaths from the disease down 10% in a decade. He said: ""More than Â£200m will deliver six elective treatment centres to allow people to be diagnosed and treated more quickly for planned surgery. ""Our DCE Programme has been developed to remind people across Scotland of their resilience and strength, in the hope that they'll act early to give themselves the best chance of finding cancer early. ""We are continuing to tackle variations in early detection rates, committing over Â£1m to health boards and third sector organisations since 2016, through our Health Inequalities Fund to improve screening uptake in groups least likely to participate. ""We are working to beat cancer, investing over Â£100m in our strategy as well as an additional Â£14m supporting health boards reduce waiting times.""

input: By Milton NkosiBBC News, Johannesburg Nkosazana Clarice Dlamini-Zuma, 68 - a senior member of the governing African National Congress (ANC) - has been criss-crossing the country in recent months seeking a mandate to be its first woman president. Since returning from a five-year stint in Addis Ababa running the African Union, Ms Dlamini-Zuma has addressed crowds at events from funerals to political rallies. The eldest of eight children, she was born in the rolling hills of KwaZulu-Natal province in 1949 and joined the underground anti-apartheid student movement in the early 1970s while at medical school there. This raised the ire of the apartheid regime. She was forced to flee into exile and eventually completed her studies at Bristol University in the UK in 1978. 'In the claws of the ex-husband' The newly qualified Ms Dlamini-Zuma worked at Mbabane Government Hospital in Swaziland. This is where she met and was charmed by Mr Zuma, then also an exiled member of the ANC. Mr Zuma is a polygamist, and she was one of his three wives until she divorced him in 1998. Ms Dlamini-Zuma, who had four children with her ex-husband, never remarried. Nevertheless, President Zuma, who steps down as party leader in December, has endorsed her to succeed him as ANC president, and preferably of the country after elections due in 2019. Pressure has been increasing on him to step down earlier amid accusations of corruption, which he denies. Asked whether she should rise to the very top of the political landscape, he said: ""She has grown in the struggle. She has run a number of positions. She has been a minister in a number of departments, there's no question at all. ""If the ANC says we think we can give this responsibility and she agrees, then that's not a concern at all."" Who is Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma? She reported the local Sunday Times newspaper to the independent press council after it quoted unnamed sources in January as saying that she was spending ""a lot of time"" at the president's rural homestead. The council ordered the newspaper to apologise for presenting the allegation ""as fact in its headline"". Her lawyers had dismissed the report as ""untruthful, inaccurate and unfair"", and accused the newspaper of publishing a ""bizarre story that an African woman, despite divorcing her husband to whom she had been married in terms of the Civil Law, remains in the claws of the ex-husband in the name of polygamy"". A former leader of the women's wing of the ANC, she had the confidence of South Africa's first black president, Nelson Mandela, who appointed her as health minister after the end of white minority rule in 1994. She was widely credited with introducing legislation which made it illegal for people to smoke in public areas such as restaurants and airports. Her tenure as health minister was followed by a 10-year stint as foreign minister, during the rule of Mr Mandela's successor - and Mr Zuma's rival - Thabo Mbeki. Mr Mbeki had offered her the post of deputy president after he sacked Mr Zuma in 2005, following allegations of corruption against him. 'Walking with the wolves' The rise of NDZ - as she is sometimes referred to nowadays - has not come without controversy. While health minister she became embroiled in the first big corruption scandal to hit the ANC government. Her department awarded a 14 million rand ($1,2m; Â£700,00) tender to renowned playwright Mbongeni Ngema to come up with a sequel to Sarafina, a musical to educate people about the dangers of HIV/Aids. Following a public outcry over the huge cost of the musical, an anti-corruption body - the public protector's office - carried out an investigation. It led to the termination of the contract. ""Mr Ngema's company had not adhered fully to the spirit and terms of the contract, and it appeared they had tendered a defective service,"" the public protector's office said. Ms Dlamini-Zuma refused to resign, despite pressure from the opposition. Also as health minister, she was criticised for supporting Virodene, a toxic substance which had been rejected by the wider scientific community, as a remedy for HIV/Aids. After spending most of her life fighting for the downtrodden, she has uncharacteristically chosen to walk with the wolves during the current campaign. Some of her current backers have a litany of corruption scandals hanging around their necks. Many of her old comrades are irked by her political expediency, even if it is for the top job in Africa's most industrialised economy. 'My own woman' More recently, she was chastised for labelling nationwide protests calling for President Zuma to step down as ""rubbish"" in a tweet which was then deleted from her timeline. Some said Mr Zuma was trying to protect himself from prosecution over corruption allegations, because if his former wife becomes president, she would be reluctant to send the police to lock him up during his retirement in his village of Nkandla. However NDZ was incensed at the suggestion she wants to be president in order to protect her former husband from his legal woes. She said: ""I am my own woman and I have worked hard to be here,"" she told the Johannesburg Star newspaper. ""I have my own track record in the ANC and in government. I am a doctor and one of the longest-serving cabinet ministers under former Presidents Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki. Before Zuma became president,"" she was quoted as saying. Those who know her well describe Ms Dlamini-Zuma as firm, controlling and someone who at times tells it like it is. But at home some of her stories are of a motherly figure. Even though there are other women aspiring to the number one spot, she has become the face of the ANC Women's League's call that ""South Africa is ready for a woman president."" The diminutive figure I have come to know over the years is a humble and intellectually astute individual. But unlike her former husband, her personality cannot be described as charming. But the question is whether the people will follow her as she continues to soldier on towards the presidential seat.

input: By David LumbBBC News, West Midlands Now, as Jaguar Land Rover announces plans to create an extra 1,700 jobs at its base in Solihull - on top of 800 created in January - is the West Midlands town becoming ""Land Rover Land""? Discovery, Defender, and Freelander models line the leafy cul-de-sacs that surround the plant on the outskirts of the town centre. Families talk about the difficulty of finding their cars in supermarket car parks because there are now so many of the same cars from the same company. 'Status vehicle' Even Solihull Council is in on the act, with the mayoral car being - of course - a black 2013 Range Rover Vogue. ""Suddenly they are everywhere, throughout the streets of Solihull,"" said mayor Joe Tildesley. ""I look out the window and it's the first car I see. It's a status vehicle people aspire to have. ""They are here and are - quite properly - endorsed by many people, including the council. I don't see it as a bad thing."" Mother-of-three Julie Henn, lives in Nerstal Drive in Solihull, just a stone's throw away from the Jaguar Land Rover site. The 55-year-old said she regretted leaving her Land Rover behind so much when she moved to the UK from South Africa about eight years ago that she ended up buying a replacement soon afterwards. Her husband is now hoping to buy a new one as well. ""There was not a day that went by when I did not regret it,"" she said. ""Now I can't believe how many there are. On Saturday I saw four in a row. ""A Range Rover, two Discoveries and a Freelander - one after the other."" 'Confidence booster' Mrs Henn said she knew people who struggled to find their Land Rovers in supermarket car parks because they were so common. Mother-of two Joanne Rumney, who lives around the corner in Oakslade Drive, owns a Land Rover Discovery from the 1990s. ""People are proud to have JLR here,"" said the 38-year-old. ""It has a status that people like. They are good family cars."" Jaguar Land Rover, which also has manufacturing bases in Castle Bromwich and Halewood on Merseyside, has said the latest announcement will bring the total number of jobs it has created in the UK over the past three years to almost 11,000. Mr Tildesley said the firm's investment had ""undoubtedly"" boosted Solihull with other firms benefiting from knock-on trade. Rachael Eade, from the Manufacturing Advisory Service, said every job created by vehicle manufacturers leads to two or three in the supply chain. ""It's a huge confidence booster locally and UK-wide,"" she said. ""It's 1,700 jobs and three times that in the supply chain. ""I think the new technology involved will attract a new, younger market and will make a difference to the supply chain. ""Younger people have more of a desire to be involved in that as they probably view car manufacturing to be a bit dusty, dirty and not for them."" But not everyone is happy. Some shops said the expansion had brought with it increased parking problems. Terry Cosma, manager of Solihull Fish Bar in Hob's Moat Road, said: ""I have not noticed any change in business. We have always had a steady flow of JLR workers. ""The big problem is the lack of parking round here. They are along the pavements, the grass verges, sometimes it's difficult to get into the side roads."" Julie Jones, who works at Trev's Hairdressers, also in Hob's Moat Road, said: ""The parking is ridiculous - diabolical. ""There is nowhere for us to go because all the Land Rover workers are there."" In 2005, MG Rover based at Longbridge, less than 10 miles from Solihull, went into administration. About 14,000 people employed by the Rover group were based at the site. But Ms Eade said she did not believe Solihull would suffer a similar fate and collapse if JLR's fortunes changed in the future. ""The automotive industry has learnt lessons from MG Rover,"" she said. ""They are not as heavily reliant on one customer now and if you are a designer you probably work for JLR, Mini, JCB, Ford. ""I don't think the bubble will burst for the foreseeable future.""

input: By Deborah Cohen & Jake MorrisBBC Newsnight A study by Sheffield council shows people in low-paid jobs, with insecure contracts, who couldn't afford to isolate have been hardest hit by the disease in the city. The council split its population into 10 income brackets, from the wealthiest to the most deprived, and looked at Covid case rates in each group. While the rates were generally greater among the less well-off, they were highest of all in the third income group, rather than the poorest or second poorest. ""The impact is really on the working poor,"" said Sheffield's director of public health, Greg Fell. This group is ""most likely to be low paid"", on insecure contracts and unable to afford to isolate. ""Transmission in that group of people is much higher,"" said Mr Fell. Patrick Meleady recognises the impact first-hand, from his work with a food bank in east Sheffield. ""People here work in factories, are care workers, bus drivers and taxi drivers,"" said Mr Meleady. ""So they're on the front line having an interaction,"" he said. ""If you're in another area and you're more affluent and you've got a different career path, you're going to remove yourself from that [risk of Covid]."" The findings are supported by further research carried out by Sheffield City Council, which mapped Covid case rates as they spread across the urban population in the first wave. The mapping, in the animated video below, shows that at the start, cases appeared among people living in the wealthier west of the city, driven perhaps by those returning from half-term ski trips. It then spread and remained stubbornly embedded in the poorer east. By the end of June, as national case numbers plummeted and England emerged from its first lockdown, the majority of new positive cases were confined to the most deprived area of the city. These poorer areas have continued to experience high rates of Covid in the second wave too. The fact the disease has affected poorer areas more than wealthy ones in the UK has been well recorded. Work by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows those living in the most deprived neighbourhoods are more than twice as likely to die from Covid as those in the least deprived. But Greg Fell is ""surprised by the starkness"" of what the council found in Sheffield. ""It was always going to be something that was only unevenly or unequally split,"" he said. It's not just jobs that play a role in Covid risks. Poor housing has been known as a factor for some time. A recent study of housing conditions looked at how the number of people living in a house, and the number of rooms, affected Covid risk. The research, run by University College London's Virus Watch team, found a clear link. Overcrowded households ""had twice the risk of coronavirus infection compared to people living in un-crowded households,"" said Prof Rob Aldridge who runs the study. The high verses low income split in Covid cases is consistent with existing differences in health in Sheffield. The difference in life expectancy can be as much as 20 years, says Dr Jennie Joyce, a GP working in the city. And existing illnesses, such as diabetes and heart disease, may mean people getting sicker from Covid. She's not surprised by the impact. ""I think we did know that on the ground. It just wasn't coming down from the top,"" she said. A report prepared by Sheffield's Citizens Advice Bureau shows those who were already struggling pre-Covid are in a worse position now. It cites factors including not being able to travel to cheaper food shops and higher heating and lighting costs from being at home, and it warns the poor have got into greater debt. Gulnaz Hussain, who works at Firvale Community Hub, says money is always tight for people in the nearby area. And when work is always uncertain for many in the city, Covid can feel like one more thing ""We have community and community resilience, and being able to know how to cope in difficult situations,"" says Ms Husain. ""This is just another one of those risks."" Watch Deborah Cohen's report for Newsnight on BBC iPlayer (UK only).

input: By Michael Cowan & Livvy HaydockBBC File on 4 Jamie - not his real name - is in his early 20s . For the last few years he made money by scamming women, usually those a lot older than him, who were looking for love. He did this while in prison for an unrelated crime, using an illegal mobile phone he had hidden. He was recently released and spoke to the BBC's File on 4 programme. He says he will not commit the fraud again, and wants to make amends by exposing some of his tactics to serve as a warning to others. 'It was work' ""It was a last resort kind of thing, I just saw how easy it was,"" Jamie says. ""The most I ever got from a girl was Â£10,000... every week she was sending me Â£100, Â£200. ""I've forgotten her name now, I don't see it as a relationship, I [saw] it as work."" He says his accounts were blocked after the victims reported them, but he was never punished for the frauds. He says people using dating apps should watch out for men contacting them who are a lot younger or ""better looking"", who start asking for money, especially if they have never met in person. Jamie says he picked his targets by looking for those he thought likely to be lonely and lacking attention from others on the apps. His theory was that they would be more willing to ""do anything"" to avoid risk losing the connection. And he says he would use his real photographs, confident that his looks would help lure victims in. ""I would go for older women and look for the desperation,"" he says. ""Keywords would be like 'I just want happiness' or something like that. I'll act cool at the start and if she talks back then I know she's interested just from my pictures. ""From then, that's when I start putting my game on, selling you dreams like 'I want a kid with you.' ""[I] just say everything that she wants to hear until she's fallen in love."" Until he felt that his victim was emotionally attached, Jamie said he wouldn't tell them he was in prison. He claims that he often messaged women for months, charming them before revealing the fact. When he did, he says he lied about the reason he was jailed, telling women it was for driving offences rather than violent crime. 'He was charming' In 2020, there were nearly 7,000 reports of so-called romance fraud. It cost victims almost Â£70m last year. And according to trade association UK Finance, there has been a 20% increase in bank transfers relating to romance fraud during the pandemic. Di Pogson, a 59-year-old widow, gave away her entire life savings of Â£40,000 to someone she met on a dating app. It turned out to be a scam. The man she'd fallen for did not really exist. He was the creation of three fraudsters who preyed on vulnerable women across southern England. ""I always had in the back of my mind that I would never, ever be conned. I was too savvy,"" she says. ""But then 'Kevin' came along and he was charming. He was interested in me. ""It started off at just under Â£500 for his vet bills, and the sums gradually went up. ""When I completely ran out of money, he called me all sorts of names, he stopped answering his phone. ""Alarm bells rang and I went to the police."" She says she felt gullible and stupid. ""I told the children. It was horrible having to tell them I had lost so much money to somebody I had never met."" PC Bernadette Laurie, a financial abuse safeguarding officer, says many of the cases reported to police last year happened during lockdown, when people felt more lonely than usual. Victims often discovered they had been fooled, she adds, when the criminals failed to meet up after the restrictions eased. She recommends following advice by Action Fraud. How to spot a scam These behaviours could signal your prospective partner is not what they claim to be: One way of checking on photos can be to do a reverse image search via Google Images, Bing Visual Search, TinEye or another similar service. Twenty-five of the UK's police forces also provided data in response to a freedom of information request made by File on 4. This suggested that of the country's most popular dating apps, Tinder, Plenty of Fish and Grindr were the ones most associated with crime reports between 2018 and 2020. Over this time, the number of crime reports associated with dating apps rose by 24% to 903 reports last year. This is only a partial data set. Eighteen forces, including some of the country's biggest like the Metropolitan Police, Greater Manchester Police, PSNI, and Police Scotland, did not provide data, meaning the actual crime numbers are likely to be significantly higher. The File on 4 documentary The Dangers of Dating Apps will be broadcast at 20:00 on Radio 4, Tuesday 23 February and then be available on BBC Sounds

input: The Labour leader told students in London he wanted a society ""where we don't automatically criminalise people"", The Guardian reported. Ex-Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman said prostitution was ""exploitation and abuse"" not ""an industry"". Labour sources said Mr Corbyn had been answering a direct question, not making a policy announcement. They added that he believed sex workers should not be seen as criminals. 'More civilised' The Labour leader had been taking part in a question and answer session at Goldsmiths University, in London, on Thursday. According to the Guardian, he said: ""I am in favour of decriminalising the sex industry. I don't want people to be criminalised. I want to be [in] a society where we don't automatically criminalise people. ""Let's do things a bit differently and in a bit more civilised way."" In 2014, Northern Ireland became the first part of the UK to pass legislation making the purchase of sexual services illegal. In the rest of the UK, paying for sex is not against the law but many activities linked to it, such as brothel-keeping, kerb-crawling and soliciting sex in a public place, are outlawed. 'Exploitation' Backbench Labour MP Jess Phillips criticised Mr Corbyn's comments on Twitter. ""Man says we should decriminalize a known violence against women. Why did it have to be this man,"" she wrote. But the English Collective of Prostitutes, which campaigns for decriminalisation, voiced its support for Mr Corbyn's comments. Supporters of decriminalisation include Amnesty International, which says it would mean sex workers are ""no longer forced to live outside the law"". Ms Harman tweeted: ""Prostitution's exploitation and abuse not ""work/an industry"". Women should be protected and men prosecuted."" An attempt by former Labour Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart to change the law to criminalise paying for sex was defeated in 2014. Sex workers had criticised the proposal, saying criminalising their clients will make their work more dangerous.

input: A small bowl bought for just $35 (Â£25) at a market sale in the US state of Connecticut has turned out to be a rare 15th-Century Chinese artefact. The white porcelain bowl was spotted by an unidentified antiques enthusiast near New Haven last year, and they quickly sought an expert evaluation. The experts came back with good news, revealing that the bowl is thought to be worth between $300,000 and $500,000. In fact, it is believed to be one of only seven such bowls in existence and most of the others are in museums. The bowl is set to be auctioned in New York on 17 March by Sotheby's auction house, which describes the find in its listing as ""exceptional and rare"". ""It was immediately apparent to both of us that we were looking at something really very, very special,"" Angela McAteer, an expert on Chinese ceramics at the auctioneer's told the Associated Press news agency. ""The style of painting, the shape of the bowl, even just the colour of the blue is quite characteristic of that early, early 15th-Century period of porcelain,"" she added. The 6-inch (16cm) diameter bowl features cobalt blue floral paintings and an intricate design around the rim. ""All the characteristics and hallmarks are there that identify it as a product of the early Ming [Dynasty] period,"" Ms McAteer said. How exactly the bowl found itself being sold at a Connecticut outdoor sale remains a mystery. Some have suggested it may have been passed down through generations of the same family. ""It's always quite astounding to think that it kind of still happens, that these treasures can be discovered,"" Ms McAteer said. ""It's always really exciting for us as specialists when something we didn't even know existed here appears seemingly out of nowhere."" You might also be interested in:

They include 22 allegations of rape, five counts of false imprisonment, two of assault by penetration and two of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Bristol Crown Court heard the grime star raped one woman in his flat days after meeting her at a city nightclub. An interview she gave to police was played in court in which she said Mr Anokye ""just got really angry out of nowhere"" and held her against her will. ""I think he paused before like 'You gonna talk',"" she told police. ""And he says 'If you pass out, then you're gonna wake up and think you're in a horror film'."" The woman said Mr Anokye placed a cloth over her nose and mouth, which left her skin ""burning"" and red. 'Panic attack' She described how she had been wearing a coat with a large collar on, which Mr Anokye grabbed and ""pulled it tight"" around her neck. ""I don't know how long that was but I lost consciousness,"" she said. ""When I came back, I started having a panic attack, so I was breathing really fast and crying."" Mr Anokye allegedly punched and kicked the woman before raping her. Prosecutors have previously told the jury that Mr Anokye, of Millennium Promenade, Bristol, ""imprisoned, assaulted, sexually violated and raped"" the four complainants in the case. Police examining mobile phones and a laptop found at Mr Anokye's home after his arrest discovered searches for ""dacryphilia"", the court heard. Jurors have been told this is sexual arousal from another's fear. The trial continues.

Following Donald Trump's comments during last week's trade visit that the NHS would be ""on the table"" in any future trade talks between the UK and the USA, Eluned Morgan said there was ""absolutely no prospect whatsoever of us allowing the Welsh NHS to be part of any negotiation.""

input: Many workers can expect a ""miserable Christmas"" without targeted support for employers, the union warned. The government's furlough programme will end on 31 October. A Treasury spokesperson said the government had ""not hesitated to act in creative and effective ways to support jobs and we will continue to do so"". Wednesday marks 45 days before the end of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which is the same amount of time employers must give for notice of redundancy. The call comes amid growing evidence that the winding down of the scheme is leading to more plans for job cuts. The number of firms that notified the government in June about plans to cut 20 or more jobs was five times higher than in the same month last year, figures obtained by the BBC show. A Freedom of Information request shows that in June, 1,778 firms said they were intending to cut more than 139,000 jobs in England, Wales and Scotland. In total, nine million people have been furloughed for at least one three-week period since March, However, about 695,000 UK workers have gone from the payrolls of UK companies since then and it is feared that more will follow if the government stops paying to safeguard jobs. Unite said that without ""a clear and urgent sign"" from the government that it was responding to calls to extend the scheme, it feared that ""employers facing short-term struggles will issue redundancy notices"". The government has been urged by MPs, business groups, unions and political opponents to continue the furlough programme, in which workers placed on leave receive 80% of their pay, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. The scheme, which has cost more than Â£35bn, was initially funded by the government, but firms started to contribute to wages in September after the scheme began to wind down. Last week, the Treasury Select Committee said the government should consider a targeted extension of the scheme. Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said a signal from the government would ""put a floor under struggling employers who are working hard to stabilise in the face of immense challenges"". ""With our competitor nations announcing the extension or modification of their jobs retention schemes, we ask that your government recognises the need for UK businesses and workers to receive similar support,"" Mr McCluskey wrote in a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson. A spokeswoman said Unite wanted to see support for sectors including manufacturing, aviation infrastructure, aerospace and hospitality. The government has repeatedly rebuffed the calls for an extension to the scheme, saying that it has served its purpose in cushioning the economy during the coronavirus crisis. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said his priority is to find new ways to protect jobs. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The furlough scheme has done what it was designed to do - save jobs and help people back into employment."" The spokesperson said the government had made ""unprecedented interventions"", including firms being given Â£1,000 for every furloughed worker still employed in January, business rates holidays, VAT cuts and the Kickstart scheme, which gives young people jobs experience.

input: By Chloe HadjimatheouBBC World Service, Athens Emilio Papas opens the tall iron door to his squat near Exarhia Square, in the centre of Athens, to reveal an enormous five-storey building with high ceilings and a grand staircase. ""It was a health hazard for the whole community, full of dead birds, rancid water and maggots,"" he says about the abandoned social security office, which he now calls home. In the past few months the number of jobless in Greece has shot up. The current total for young people stands at 51.1%, and Emilio Papas is one of them. He smiles as he admits that the irony of the situation has not escaped him: living in a former social security office when neither he nor any of the other squatters has ever made any national insurance payments. Last year Mr Papas and a group of his unemployed friends, aged between 18 and 32 years old, spent several months making the building habitable. Each of the squatters has his own flat and they are planning on using the ground floor as a community centre for the neighbourhood. They have also opened their doors to an older resident, 60-year-old George Koutselas, who would otherwise have been left homeless. ""I worked most of my life but none of my bosses ever paid national insurance contributions for me, so now I don't get a pension or any benefits. ""As far as the Greek state is concerned I don't exist,"" says Mr Koutselas. Unemployment benefit in Greece is available only to people who have made national insurance contributions and since many young people have never had a job, they are not entitled to any financial support. Even those who do receive the monthly payments of 360 euros (Â£300) see them stop after one year. After that, unemployed people in Greece are on their own, without access to financial support or free healthcare. Talk of 'revolution' 27-year-old economics graduate Eleni Katsarea is unemployed and worried she might not have a job when her benefit runs out in a few months. ""I am trying not to think about it because I get too stressed,"" she says. The first person in her family to go to university, she never imagined she would end up dependent on the state. But today one in three graduates in Greece is without work and unemployment among postgraduates has doubled. ""I have a degree, I speak several languages and I have something to offer the country but they don't let me, there are no opportunities,"" says Ms Katsarea. When she is not looking for work Eleni Katsarea goes to the centre of town where there are demonstrations almost every day. ""I would like to see a public audit of this debt they are asking us to pay. Who got all the money? Because it wasn't us,"" she shouts over the noise of the protest. The talk among her and her friends is of revolution. Nick Maltoutzis, the deputy editor of the daily English language paper, Kathimerini, says that Greece has reached a dangerous point in terms of youth unemployment. He says too many young people are locked into a situation without prospects, without jobs and without political parties that represent their views. ""There is clearly a lot of anger building up in the system and you cannot predict how the pressure is going to express itself - but you can be sure it will not be pleasant,"" he says. Brain-drain The frustration with the lack of employment opportunities among the young is only exacerbated by the feeling that they have been abandoned by a state which offers them little support. Local unemployment offices are shutting down as a result of cuts in public spending, and those that are open offer little or no advice on how to find a job. The general secretary for the Ministry of Labour, Anna Stratinaki, admits that the ministry is battling to get to grips with plans for the total restructuring of the public sector. ""Young people need to show endurance, courage and solidarity so that we can overcome this difficult period together,"" she says. But endurance, courage and solidarity do not pay the rent and so, for many over-educated and under-employed young people, the future is abroad. Although there are no statistics for the numbers leaving the country, research from 2010 suggests that nearly 85% of Greeks studying abroad were not planning to return. At Athens International Airport 25-year-old Grigoris Panayotopoulos is checking in his baggage as he prepares to fly to Trieste in Italy where he has a job as an engineer lined up. ""Who knows, maybe 10 years from now I might decide to leave behind the job and return to Greece, but at the moment I am planning on going there forever."" It is not his fault, he says, that the Greek economy is in crisis, so why should he pay the price? As he leaves, Grigoris Panayotopoulos takes with him his skills and education. The risk for Greece is that this brain-drain could leave the country without the very people needed to rebuild the economy. 'Scars' of unemployment But for many young people who do not have the means to leave, like Emilios Papas at the squat in the abandoned social security office, they are out on their own. He estimates that at least 70 former government buildings around the city are being used as squats. ""People need to start doing things for themselves because the state only has its own best interests at heart,"" he says. In reality there is little the Greek government can do about the lack of jobs, so long as its hands are tied by the promises it has made to cut the deficit in return for bailout funds. There is evidence to show that people who are unemployed for a long time in their youth have less confidence and tend to achieve less in later life. Experts call this the ""unemployment scar"". So could Greece be storing up a troubled generation for the future? Nick Maltoutzis at the newspaper Kathimerini fears that could be the case. ""People in their 20sâ¦ will end up feeling useless and then it's very difficult to change the psychology,"" he says.

Residents and workers were told that an anonymous offer has been made for the airport, but there is no deal as yet. The loss-making airport was bought by Anne Gloag for a Â£1 in October. On Wednesday, Dutch airline KLM said it was suspending its Cityhopper flights between the airport and Amsterdam from 10 April. A petition to keep the airport open has gained more than 12,000 signatures. Supporters believe it could bring jobs to a deprived area and benefit residents who would otherwise have to travel to Heathrow or Gatwick. A 45-day consultation on the airport closure with its 144 staff is ongoing.

input: In a video posted by Pear Video on the Miaopai video website, the mother and her husband explain they need to raise at least 100,000 yuan (roughly Â£11,250) for one of their children, who is in an intensive care unit. It's been viewed more than 2.4 million times and has had more than 5,000 comments since it was shared on China's social media platform Sina Weibo. You may also like: The video was filmed in Shenzhen's Children's Park - situated centrally in Shenzhen, a major city in the Guangdong province of China. The mother says she is selling her breast milk to raise money quickly, because one of her twin daughters is in the intensive care unit at the Bao'an District People's Hospital in Shenzhen. Her husband explains that the couple owe the hospital ""hundreds of thousands of yuan"" and ""the doctor said that once she's cured, we should prepare to pay at least 100,000 yuan (roughly Â£11,250)"". There have been criticisms of Chinese healthcare in recent years as medical centres have been labelled overstretched, and amid claims that people pay extra to jump queues. The reaction online has been mostly sympathetic, with people sharing the phrase ""sell milk, save girl"". Users urged passers-by to ""give money to them"", with some saying they would donate if they saw the parents on the street. And one comment with more than 3,000 likes reads: ""Once people in the lowest level of society become critically ill, they don't even have basic rights."" But some users were less sympathetic, with one person lambasting the decision to sell breast milk as ""a vulgar way of asking for help"". Another added: ""Everybody can understand that you are helpless and hoping to receive aid, but how can you retain your dignity if you have to sell milk?"" But one person criticised the negative comments, saying: ""This is the love of the most helpless parentsâ¦ those who are saying nasty things online should think that if this was your child, would you care about maintaining face, or your child's life?""

input: By Mark SavageBBC News entertainment reporter ""This is the craziest thing we've ever done,"" Este Haim announces to London's O2 arena. She is at the superdrome to support Florence and the Machine, and her band is about to end their set with a drum solo. Heads down, arms flailing, they unleash a four-minute tsunami of percussion and hair. And the audience, primed for the tribal rhythms of the night's main act, absolutely love it. Half an hour later, the three Haim sisters are back in their dressing room, looking a little less like cavewomen as they demurely sip tea while coming to terms with the fact they have just played on the same stage as the Rolling Stones. ""Don't even talk to me about that, because that is so insane,"" says 26-year-old Este. ""I've been crawling on the floor, trying to soak it all up,"" chips in her youngest sister, Alana, 21. ""I think I have a little Mick Jagger in me."" An argument ensues as the siblings try to decide which of them is ""the most Mick"". It goes back and forth for a couple of minutes until Danielle puts her foot down. ""I feel like both of you would be Mick,"" she tells her sisters. ""And I am in the middle of a Mick sandwich."" In fact, if anyone is the honorary Mick Jagger of Haim, it's 23-year-old Danielle. She earned her rock stripes on tour with Jenny Lewis and Julian Casablancas of The Strokes and has clearly picked up a few tips on poise and attitude. Oh, and she has a lip curl that would put the senior Rolling Stone to shame. The middle sister, and de facto frontwoman, she is also the quietest member of Haim. While her sisters goof around and riff on British television shows (Alana does a frighteningly accurate impression of Dragon's Den star Duncan Bannatyne), Danielle only really comes to life when talking about music. 'No-one cared' Haim started playing together as youngsters, enlisted into a covers band by their estate agent parents. As Rockinhaim, they covered Motown and Santana at street fairs and charity gigs around the San Fernando Valley. ""It was really cool,"" says Alana. ""Until we were about 11."" So in 2006, the girls gave their parents the elbow and ventured out on their own. ""We did what a lot of bands in LA do,"" says Danielle. ""We played around locally, wherever we could play, and we invited all our friends. ""We were scared to ask the main bands for money,"" Este adds. ""We were just so excited to play."" ""By the fourth year, we were having to beg our friends to come. Texting everyone, 'please come and pay $10 for the show.'"" Back then, Haim was not a full-time concern. Alana was at high school, Este studying ""Brazilian carnival music"" at UCLA and Danielle was on the road with Cee-Lo Green. But it was one of her other touring partners, Julian Casablancas, that finally gave the band a kick start. ""He had seen us play and he said, 'what are you guys doing? What's going on?'"" Danielle recalls. ""We didn't know what to do. We had songs on MySpace but no-one really cared. He said, 'just write. Write and come back and hit the ground running.' And that's kind of what we did."" ""We went on Haim-atus,"" laughs Este. Based in their parents' living room, the band took a year to develop their sound - blending the classic guitar chops of Rockinhaim with the staccato hiccups of their favourite bands TLC and Destiny's Child. But, for some reason, they could not get the songs to sound right in the studio. There are ""four EPs"" that will ""never be heard"" in public, admits Alana. ""Whenever we recorded an EP and got it back, we would put it on our stereo and [after] the first five seconds we would cringe and shut it off."" ""In the studio, everything sounds cool,"" explains Danielle. ""But once you put it in your car... We would just throw it away."" Acclaim The missing ingredient turned out to be sub-bass: The lowest frequencies audible to the human ear, used extensively by dance acts to give their rhythm tracks an added wallop. Danielle credits TV composer Ludwig Goransson (New Girl, Community) with the discovery. ""We love rap and we love hip-hop,"" she says. ""Ludwig had all these sub-bass samples and when we found them, we were like, 'oh my God. Put that on everything!'"" ""He looked at us like we were crazy,"" adds Alana. ""But we'd been searching for that for six years."" The first song Haim recorded with Goransson was Forever, which became the title track of their first EP. Released for free in June, it received near-universal acclaim from music blogs and alternative radio stations like BBC 6 Music and Australia's Triple J. Bright, bold and melodic, it is not necessarily a musical revolution - but the combination of Fleetwood Mac folk-rock with the intricate hi-hat trills of '90s R&B is, at least, a fresher take on rock than recycled '60s guitar riffs. That is why Haim were invited on tour by Florence, and by Mumford and Sons. Another stadium-level rock band invited them out on the road this year - but Haim turned them down so they can finish their album. Their family are thrilled by the success. Grandma Haim flew in from Israel to see the O2 gig, while the girls' parents are vicariously living the dream. ""Before we got onstage for the soundcheck, my dad was up there playing drums,"" laughs Este. ""He was like, 'OK they're good, I checked them out for you.' ""And we said, 'oh, come on dad, you just wanted to play drums in the O2 arena. Let's be honest.'""

input: By Mary McCoolBBC Scotland news At age 21 she was a hallmark of British television - a young, smiling dynamo from Edinburgh's Portobello who was perfectly at home leading daytime programmes such as Fully Booked, The Big Breakfast and Live and Kicking before landing a prime time slot hosting Friday night favourite Top of the Pops. Her fan base was burgeoning and she often left the studio in a state of total euphoria. But her seemingly unstoppable energy would deflate as she stepped inside her London flat - where loneliness, self-doubt and depression set in. Then one morning, an event unfolded that left her unable to get out of bed. Gail had taken part in a nude photo shoot for men's magazine FHM, which was projected onto the Houses of Parliament in a now infamous publicity stunt. It helped sell more than one million copies of the magazine within two months. Decades on, Gail maintains she had no idea the photo would be used in such a manner - and that she was never paid for the work. Gail told BBC Scotland: ""I've dealt with things since I was 18 but that knocked my confidence a lot - to think I had trusted someone and then to find my bottom on Big Ben. ""I had to deal with the backlash, some people were kind and some people were unkind. It made me stay in bed for quite a long time."" Revisiting the past The presenter's mental health is the focal point of a new BBC Scotland documentary, which sees her retrace crucial points in her life and career while often hearing difficult truths from friends and family. In the film's opening scenes she revisits the Palace of Westminster and recalls the pressures she faced in the aftermath of the FHM media storm. Criticism and jibes followed her around, occasionally in a very public way - including on an episode of Nevermind the Buzzcocks that same year. Known for his acerbic wit, host Mark Lamarr joked he had seen ""more than enough"" of her topless - a comment which left Gail visibly upset on camera. She said: ""We met up in the green room and I said he was extremely rude - he actually said sorry, that he thought it was a joke. ""Personally it just made me feel insignificant. This was a long time ago when you didn't have the Me Too movement. ""Everyone was going out afterwards; I just wanted to stay home. I thought maybe it's my fault and I deserve this sort of comment."" Despite frequent bouts of unhappiness, keeping up the appearance of 'wee smiley Gail' was of utmost importance - though at the time Gail was unaware of the stress it placed on her mind and body. After moving to London aged 19, there was rarely any food in her fridge - instead she survived on wine or Jelly Babies. She developed anorexia nervosa - a condition she lived with for around nine years. But Gail only realised something was wrong when she was banned from her gym after fainting. ""People kept saying 'oh wow, you're looking great',"" she said. ""I kept thinking every time I get thinner, someone said I looked great. ""I was enjoying the adoration and it got out of control, I couldn't stop it. I thought if I could control my food and make myself look what I thought was better, then everything is going to be great in the world. ""But it wasn't, I just ended up in the hospital very unwell."" I don't blame TV What followed over the next two decades was a further polarising of highs and lows for Gail. She married and celebrated the birth of her ""miracle"" daughter Honey, having been told by doctors she couldn't have children. A severe struggle with her mental health continued, and Gail developed alopecia, turned to self harm, was sectioned under the Mental Health Act (1983) and experienced a period of homelessness. She has no definitive answer for what went wrong for her, though she strongly suspects she developed an aversion to talking through her feelings in her early childhood. And although she has watched her personal life splashed across headlines, Gail does not blame her career in television for any of her struggles. She said: ""Being a TV presenter was my favourite thing in the world, it was the most fun ever. ""I think there were a lot of deeper issues which came out at certain points. ""I know there's something not quite right wired in my brain. ""It doesn't make me a bad person, it doesn't mean you can give me a badge and tell me what it is. I'd rather just be Gail."" Being Gail Porter is available to watch on BBC iPlayer.

input: The Indiana candidate made the remarks while debating his Democratic opponent. He told reporters on Wednesday he ""abhors"" rape and that if anyone ""came away with any impression other than that, I regret it"". Mitt Romney's presidential campaign said he still backed Mr Mourdock, although he disagreed with his views. Mr Mourdock's comments come two months after another Republican candidate caused a furious backlash when he said women's bodies had ways of preventing pregnancy after rape. Mr Romney and President Barack Obama are campaigning hard for the 6 November US presidential election, in which women's votes could prove crucial. 'Humbled' During Tuesday night's debate with his Democratic challenger Joe Donnelly, Mr Mourdock was asked whether he believed abortion should be allowed in cases of rape or incest. ""I struggled with it myself for a long time, but I came to realise that life is that gift from God,"" he said. ""And, I think, even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen."" At a press conference on Wednesday, Mr Mourdock said he had been ""humbled"" by the reaction to his comments. ""If, because of the lack of clarity in my words, that they came away with an impression other than... life is precious and that I abhor violence and I'm confident that God abhors violence and rape... I truly regret it."" Mr Mourdock, a geologist by trade and the current Indiana state treasurer, said others were trying to ""twist"" his comments. There are 33 Senate seats up for grabs in next month's elections, and the Republicans are hoping to win control of the chamber. The Indiana seat was held safely at the last election by veteran Senator Richard Lugar, but he was ousted by voters in a Republican primary in May. Mr Mourdock is backed by conservative groups, including the Tea Party, and has pledged no compromise with Democrats if he is elected. What polling is available in the state suggests the he and his Democratic rival are in a tight race. Republican backlash Several Republicans in close races, including Mr Romney, have distanced themselves from Mr Mourdock to varying degrees since Tuesday's comments. Romney press secretary Andrea Saul said on Wednesday: ""We disagree on the policy regarding exceptions for rape and incest, but still support him."" The Romney campaign says his administration would not oppose abortion in instances of rape. The National Republican Senatorial Committee also stood by the Senate hopeful. But other Republicans locked in tight election races spoke out against Mr Mourdock, such as Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who also cancelled a planned trip to campaign with him. In Mr Mourdock's home state of Indiana, Representative Mike Pence, running for governor, called on the candidate to apologise. Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown also said he disagreed with Mr Mourdock's views. Democrats pounced on the debate remarks. The Democratic National Committee has released an ad reminding voters of Mr Romney's recent endorsement of Mr Mourdock. Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters that the president found the comment ""outrageous and demeaning to women"". The Obama and Romney campaigns are desperately trying to win women's votes. A gender gap poll among likely voters suggests that Mr Romney enjoys 14% more support among men than Mr Obama, while the president's support among women is 8% more than Mr Romney. In August, Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin almost derailed his own campaign when he said that in cases of ""legitimate"" rape, ""the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down"" and avert pregnancy. At the time, Mr Romney and other senior Republicans urged Mr Akin to stand aside, but he refused, saying he had misspoken, and asked to be forgiven. Mr Akin lost millions of dollars of funding, but has managed to keep his campaign afloat, polling an average of 5% behind incumbent Clare McCaskill.

input: The minister asked the group to report on the costs and feasibility of implementing changes. An hourly service between Shrewsbury and Aberystwyth could be set up as a result of the findings. The Welsh government said the minister would now consider the recommendations. The Cambrian Rail Implementation Group was formed last November. It followed a report by The Shrewsbury Aberystwyth Railway Liaison Committee which said hourly services could boost employment and tourism. Its report included 6,570 responses by residents, students and businesses in mid Wales, and also called for more trains on the coast line in the summer months. Committee members and other bodies, including Network Rail, Arriva Trains and Aberystwyth University, were then invited to join the new group by Ms Hart. Robert Robinson, joint secretary of the group looking at improvements on the network, said: ""We have submitted the business case which includes a timetable, costings and an implementation plan for the enhanced service to the minister."" He added that the group was due to discuss the report with the minister in March. Hopes for an hourly service along the Cambrian line received a boost last week when Powys planners gave the go-ahead to close five crossings on the network between Carno and Talerddig. The Network Rail project will also include replacing the crossings with two road bridges over the Aberystwyth to Shrewsbury railway line. The planning report said it was part of a plan to introduce an hourly service along the Shrewsbury to Aberystwyth line, and would also allow for the removal of speed restrictions. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""The minister has received the report and will be considering their recommendations before providing a further update to assembly members.""

input: Disability Sport Wales (DSW) performance coach Anthony Hughes was honoured for services to sport at a ceremony at Windsor Castle. Mr Hughes joined DSW in 1999 and helped develop the system that saw Welsh participation in disabled sport rocket. The coach from Penarth called his award ""one of my career highlights"". Mr Hughes took part in shot and javelin events and competed in the 1992 Barcelona Paralympics. He won silver at the 1990 IPC World Championships for the shot and in 1994 held the world record in the event. After retiring from competition due to injury, Mr Hughes moved into coaching, and saw one of his team clinch silver at the Atlanta Paralympics in 1996. In his time at DSW the number of Welsh athletes taking part in the Paralympics has risen from 17 in Sydney 2000 to 38 at London 2012. Two of his proteges - Aled Sion Davies and Josie Pearson - won gold at last summer's Paralympics. 'Richly deserved' Mr Hughes said of his award: ""When I started my job at Disability Sport Wales, I never imagined that one of my career highlights would be receiving an MBE from the Queen. ""Today was such a humbling experience. I am so grateful for all of the support I have received over the years that has enabled me to do my job."" Gareth John, chair of DSW, said of Mr Hughes: ""The MBE that he receives today is so richly deserved having dedicated much of his life to disability and Paralympic sport. ""In a long and distinguished career he has not only excelled as an elite athlete and coach, but he has also been personally responsible for the development of so many talented Paralympians who have gone on to represent Wales and Great Britain with great distinction. ""His contribution to Welsh sport has been hugely significant and it is right and proper that he is being honoured today."" Mr Hughes was named Sport Wales Coach of the Year in 2011 and was inducted into the UK Coaching Hall of Fame in 2012.

input: Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter The two counties are the latest to announce how they'll spend their share of the Â£530m superfast rural broadband fund that the government announced back in 2010. But behind the excitable press release, there's growing dismay about the whole process of delivering fast broadband to rural areas, with the word ""shambles"" making a frequent appearance. People in areas promised a share of the superfast future are growing impatient with the lack of progress. Peter Green, who lives in the community of Eggesford in Devon, is typical. He got in touch to tell me of the frustrations of trying to run a holiday cottage business on a 500Kbps broadband connection - ""We tried to upload videos but it was pointless"" - and his fruitless efforts to find out just when the Connecting Devon and Somerset organisation might take his village into the 21st Century. A contract with BT was signed earlier this year, but he's still no clearer as to when or if that will help him. Here's the charge sheet against the government's efforts: You can see why rural broadband campaigners might be confused about the government's timetable. Back in 2009, the Labour government promised that everyone would get a minimum 2Mbps by 2012. But when the coalition government arrived, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that wasn't good enough. He scrapped the 2012 target, and instead promised that Britain would have the best superfast broadband network in Europe - by 2015. What the market could not deliver - the final third of the country - would be hooked up thanks to that Â£530m fund from the licence fee, to be administered by a body called BDUK. But, as Mr Green in Devon and many others elsewhere have found, that timetable has now slipped. The process of putting each county's service out to tender has been painfully slow - 16 out of the 41 designated areas have yet to appoint a contractor - and many of the projects won't be completed until 2016. Whose fault is this? BDUK? The councils? BT? They all point the finger at the EU for investigating whether the government cash constituted state aid, but you might ask whether that could not have been foreseen. There also seems to have been far too much complexity in the bidding process. When I contacted Keri Denton, the Devon County Council executive who runs Connecting Devon and Somerset, she insisted that everything was now on schedule since the contract with BT was signed in January. Work on planning the rollout was in full swing, examining every duct, lifting every manhole, to calculate how far the fast network would stretch. I wasn't clear why some of that work could not have begun back in 2010 when the government funding was first announced, but she insisted that wasn't possible while the procurement process was ongoing. ""We would share that frustration,"" she said when I told her how painful it all looked to those waiting for the network. But she maintained that the end result would be a ""damned good deal"" for the councils, and for residents. BT, not surprisingly, agrees with that. The company insists that Britain is still on track to hit that 2015 target of the best superfast broadband in Europe - even if many of the rural projects won't be complete by then. Bill Murphy, the man running the operation, says there were other firms competing for some of the contracts in the early stages but ""they all found it very difficult to make a case"". When I put it to him that it might have been better and faster to have central government just hand the whole thing to BT from the start, with tight regulation, he disagreed. ""It is a long process, it does cost money to procure things locally, but the fact of the matter is that the only way you're going to get local buy-in is to do it locally."" It is the Department of Culture, Media and Sport which is getting most of the blame. It always looked strange that a department with little experience in this field should be in charge of such a major infrastructure project. Now it seems the Treasury agrees - a report on government infrastructure projects by the Commercial Secretary Lord Deighton is thought to be critical of BDUK, recommending a shake-up. Even Maria Miller, the current Culture Secretary, seems keen to distance herself from the work of her predecessor in this area. I understand that she feels now is the time, as the procurement process nears its conclusion, to bring in some more commercial expertise to BDUK, rather than leaving the civil servants in charge. In the meantime, Mr Green is still waiting to hear when his village will move out of the slow lane. ""We've been waiting years to get anything more than 500k and there's a total lack of information."" He points out that council taxpayers are also contributing to the scheme to the tune of more than Â£20m. ""It's a lot of money locally and we should be seeing something from it. We hear that broadband speeds are going up nationally but that's in the towns. In the rural areas we are stuck where we are."" Later this week there should be more news, both nationally and locally, on the progress of the superfast broadband project. But that ambition of showing the rest of Europe how to do it by 2015 now looks more challenging than ever.

input: By Helen BriggsEnvironment Correspondent, BBC News Fragments of wheat DNA recovered from an ancient peat bog suggests the grain was traded or exchanged long before it was grown by the first British farmers. The research, published in Science, suggests there was a sophisticated network of cultural links across Europe. The grain was found at what is now a submerged cliff off the Isle of Wight. Farming of plants and animals first appeared in the Near East, with the technology spreading along two main routes into Europe. The accepted date of arrival on the British mainland is around 6,000 years ago, as ancient hunter gatherers began to grow crops such as wheat and barley. The DNA of the wheat - known as einkorn - was collected from sediment that was once a peat bog next to a river. Scientists think traders arrived in Britain with the wheat, perhaps via land bridges that connected the south east coast of Britain to the European mainland, where they encountered a less advanced hunter gatherer society. The wheat may have been made into flour to supplement the diet, but a search for pollen and other clues revealed no signs that the crop was grown in Britain until much later. Cultural connection Dr Robin Allaby of the University of Warwick, who led the research, said 8,000 years ago the people of mainland Britain were leading a hunter-gatherer existence, while at the same time farming was gradually spreading across Europe. ""Common throughout neolithic Southern Europe, einkorn is not found elsewhere in Britain until 2,000 years after the samples found at Bouldnor Cliff,"" he said. ""For the einkorn to have reached this site there needs to have been contact between mesolithic [the culture between paleolithic and neolithic] Britons and neolithic farmers far across Europe. ""The land bridges provide a plausible facilitation of this contact. As such, far from being insular, mesolithic Britain was culturally and possibly physically connected to Europe."" The research shows that scientists can analyse genetic material preserved within the sediments of the landscapes stretching between Britain and Europe in prehistoric times. Co-researcher Prof Vincent Gaffney, of the University of Bradford, said the find marked a new chapter in British and European history. ""It now seems likely that the hunter-gather societies of Britain, far from being isolated were part of extensive social networks that traded or exchanged exotic foodstuffs across much of Europe,"" he said. Tangible link And Garry Momber of the Maritime Archaeology Trust, which collected the samples from the site, said work in the Solent had opened up an understanding of the UK's formative years in a way that he never dreamed possible. ""The material remains left behind by the people that occupied Britain as it was finally becoming an island 8,000 years ago, show that these were sophisticated people with technologies thousands of years more advanced than previously recognised. ""The DNA evidence corroborates the archaeological evidence and demonstrates a tangible link with the continent that appears to have become severed when Britain became an island.""

input: The budget for the National Assembly for Wales is increasing by 5.6% to Â£56.7m next year - above inflation and despite Welsh Government funding only rising by 1.1%. The finance committee said future increases should be reined in. The assembly commission, which is led by senior AMs, said it would respond to the report in due course. In a report, the finance committee said that ""at a time when many other public services in Wales are facing extensive and continuing real terms cuts, it is hard to justify any increase in the assembly's spending"". In the remaining years of the assembly term, which ends in 2021, the report said the commission's budget ""should not be in excess of any changes to the Welsh block grant"". The assembly has ring-fenced Â£700,000 next year to prepare the way for a new assembly building. But AMs on the cross-party committee said the evidence presented to support this proposal was ""weak"". Despite the desire for a new building, Â£1.9m was spent on refurbishing the ground floor of Ty Hywel. ""The committee questions why a short-term, less expensive solution was not implemented, prior to a new building potentially being built, which could have accommodated additional committee rooms,"" the report said. AMs also called for staff numbers to stay static in 2018-19. Numbers of staff increased from 446 posts budgeted for in 2017-18, to 452 who are currently employed by the assembly. ""A functioning legislature is essential for a healthy democracy, but we are not immune to the austerity being felt by so many public sector organisations, including our hospitals and schools,"" said Simon Thomas, the committee's chairman.

input: Chief Constable Sue Sim said the force had offered support ""far in excess of any legal duty"" to David Rathband. At an inquest in Newcastle, coroner Eric Armstrong found Mr Rathband, who was shot by Raoul Moat in 2010, took his own life in February 2012. The 44-year-old's family said they would ""continue with David's litigation"" against the force. PC David Rathband was found hanged in Blyth, in Northumberland, in February 2012, 19 months after being shot as he sat in his patrol car. The inquest had heard he had threatened to kill himself after being injured. Mr Armstrong said he was ""drawn inescapably to the conclusion that David intended to take his own life"" and that he did not believe Mr Rathband's actions were a ""cry for help"" because he had locked his door, leaving the key in the lock. He told the inquest that Mr Rathband's colleagues and friends may, ""with the benefit of hindsight, form the view that they wish they could have done something else"". However, he said such things should not be dwelled on as they had taken decisions ""which at the time seemed appropriate and were justified"". 'Totally without justification' Mr Rathband had been pursuing legal action against Northumbria Police claiming he should not have been in a patrol car alone when a gunman was on the rampage. After the hearing, Ms Sim said the coroner had been ""satisfied that David took his own life"" and ""did not criticise any individual or organisation"". ""I gave David my personal commitment that, should he wish to do so, he could return to Northumbria Police as a police officer,"" she said. ""There have been criticisms levelled at Northumbria Police during the inquest by some of David's family. ""We fully understand the family's grief at David's death but we must refute any suggestion that we failed to support David or that the support we provided was inadequate. ""Such allegations are totally without justification. We provided the highest level of financial, welfare and rehabilitation support to David, far in excess of any legal duty."" Outside the inquest, Mr Rathband's sister Debbie Essery said he had ""suffered horrific, life-changing injuries which he fought bravely and with courage and dignity, trying to come to terms with a life of pain and darkness"". ""The loss of David has devastated our family. We will never be able to come to terms with this."" She added that the family would ""now continue with David's litigation against Northumbria Police for the benefit of David's children"". 'Incredibly inspirational' Mrs Rathband's estranged wife Kath, who had told the three-day inquest their marriage ended after her husband's affair with 7/7 London bomber survivor Lisa French, asked for privacy. In a statement read by lawyer Philip Davison, she said the attack by Moat had changed her family's lives ""irrevocably"". ""David fought so hard to come to terms with the devastating injuries and the effect it had on us all as a family. ""Whilst I have lost David, he has left me with two amazing children and he would be immensely proud of them and what they have achieved, as I am."" Following the shooting, Mr Rathband set up the Blue Lamp Foundation, which supports emergency services workers injured in the line of duty, and has so far raised more than Â£400,000. Sharon Ashurst, from the charity, described him as ""incredibly inspirational"" and ""fun to be around"". Related Internet Links HM Court Service

The move rejects a recommendation by public health experts to impose the strictest level five measures. Mr Martin said moving to level five could have ""severe implications"". ""If we all act now we can stop the need to go further, with introducing level four and five restrictions,"" he continued. The taoiseach said this would risk hundreds of thousands of jobs. The challenge for government ""at this stage"", he added, was to be as ""effective and proportionate as possible"" in how it deals with Covid-19. No crowds at sport The Irish government's decision rejects the recommendation by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) to move to level five. This would have seen restrictions similar to the lockdown measures imposed in March. But TÃ¡naiste (Deputy PM) Leo Varadkar told RTÃ the government did not think the NPHET recommendation had been ""thought through properly"". Level three measures mean there will now be tighter limitations on gatherings and people will be advised to work from home unless absolutely necessary. It also means that sporting fixtures in the Republic of Ireland will be played behind closed doors, with only professional or elite sporting activities permitted. Mr Martin said the country's five-level system allowed the government to have a flexible and appropriate response to ""new trends"". However, he said it also gives ""everybody a fair opportunity to plan and respond"". In response to Mr Martin's statement, Sinn FÃ©in president Mary-Lou McDonald questioned what additional support would be provided for families, workers and businesses affected by the new regulations. The taoiseach reported that the new restrictions would be reviewed in three weeks' time. Counties Donegal and Dublin had already been placed under level three restrictions in recent weeks. There were 518 new cases in the country on Monday, with no further deaths in the previous 24 hours. Level three restrictions involve: The letter sent to the government by the NPHET on Sunday calling for a move to level five restrictions nationwide was published on Monday evening. It states that ""it is vital we do everything in our power now to arrest the current trajectory nationally and very substantially suppress the virus back down to a low level of transmission in advance of the winter months."" It adds: ""The NPHET advises that the profile of the disease is such that a graduated approach will not have sufficient or timely impact on the trajectory and scale of the disease and will not protect the core priorities set out above. ""A graduated approach would, ultimately, result in application of level five measures as mitigation. ""In contrast, the immediate application of level five is intended to limit the impact of public health of Covid-19"".

The agency urged drivers to seek alternative routes via the M3 or M40. Diversions have been put in place along the A312 and the A4, and the A40 is expected to be congested as well. London-bound traffic will be able to join the M4 at junction 2 and traffic heading out of London can stay on until junction 2, although there is a lane two closure in this direction. The Highways Agency said it expects all work on the M4 to be finished before the start of the Olympic Games later this month. The full closure of the motorway in both directions between Chiswick and Feltham began at 20:00 BST on Friday. 'Sensitive location' Restrictions on vehicles weighing more than 7.5 tonnes had been in place since March when hairline cracks were discovered in some of the steel beams. The agency said on Friday workers ""found a further crack in a sensitive location which requires us to keep the viaduct closed until the repair is complete"". Jon Caldwell from the Highways Agency warned there would be delays. ""The repair works that we need to do, to bolt the plates to the decking, needs to be done with no traffic on it,"" Mr Caldwell told the BBC. ""We need to do it now so that it's all completed ready for when the Olympic traffic starts to use the road in a few weeks' time."" The M4 is the main route between Heathrow Airport and central London and will be vital for transporting visitors into the city for the Games. It is also the major road link from London to the West Country and Wales, as well as being a heavily-used commuter route. London Mayor Boris Johnson said it was vital the repairs were completed ""as speedily as possible"".

input: By Jonathan HeadSouth East Asia correspondent A year later, Rajabhakti Park has become a millstone around the neck of the military government, and a symbol of how their efforts to promote the monarchy - at an awkward moment as Thailand faces its first royal succession in nearly 70 years - can go wrong. The project has been tarnished by allegations of corruption - a scourge General Prayuth promised to tackle when he seized power last year. Other government-backed ventures intended to showcase support for the monarchy have been similarly tainted. Not just by allegations of mismanaged funds, but also by the mysterious deaths in custody, or disappearances, of people who had been close to Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn. The monarchy is an acutely sensitive topic in Thailand, made all the more delicate by the severity of the lese majeste law which inhibits any public debate about the institution. The officially-sanctioned view of the monarchy is that it is loved and respected by all Thais, who support the law. In fact, there are Thais who take a different view, but who do not dare to express it publicly. From the moment it seized power last year, the military made protecting the monarchy from any kind of critical scrutiny a top priority. It ordered the police to be more rigorous in prosecuting anyone caught saying anything negative about the royal family. It insisted defendants be tried in military courts, and sometimes in secret. Around 100 people have been charged with lese majeste since the coup, and sentences have become harsher, with one young mother-of-two being given a 28-year sentence in August. At the same time, the military set about trying to burnish the public image of Prince Vajiralongkorn, in preparation for him to succeed the ailing King Bhumibol. The lese majeste law makes it impossible for anyone in Thailand to speak frankly about members of the royal family. The commonly-used way to describe the comparison between the heir and the King is that ""he does not enjoy the same popularity as his father."" In August, the government organised a mass bicycle ride in Bangkok, led by the Crown Prince and his eldest daughter, in honour of Queen Sirikit, who is also in poor health. It was the first time Thais had seen the 63-year-old prince in a relatively informal setting, smiling and looking trim in his cycling clothes. The event was deemed a success, and the government held another one on Friday to commemorate the King's birthday. Then in October three men were suddenly arrested and charged with lese majeste. One, a famous fortune-teller and television personality known as Mor Yong, had played a prominent role in organising the first Bike for Mom event. He and his two co-defendants, one of them an influential police officer responsible for countering anti-monarchy sentiment on the internet, were accused of abusing the Crown Prince's name to raise funds illicitly with products like t-shirts and badges linked to the bike rides. Mor Yong had posted photos of himself with prominent public figures on his Facebook page, as part of his promotional activities. Four days later, the government announced that the police major had hanged himself with his shirt in his cell. Two weeks after that, they announced that Mor Yong too had died in custody, from blood poisoning. There was no proper autopsy and both men's bodies were hurriedly cremated. At the same time the personal bodyguard of the Crown Prince disappeared. He has since been stripped of all his titles and accused of ""gravely evil acts"" against the monarchy. It is widely believed that he is dead. Two other senior military officers have also disappeared, and have since been charged with lese majeste. They have also been linked to alleged abuses in the funding of Rajabhakti Park, which was formally opened by the Crown Prince and his daughter in September. The government and the army have tried, and failed, to stem the tide of allegations surrounding the park. General Udomdej Sitabutr, who was army commander until October this year and oversaw the project, admitted that irregular commissions were demanded by middlemen for the foundries building the huge statues, which cost around $1 million each. But he said he had insisted the commissions were refunded, although he explained the foundries then donated those commissions to an army charity. There have been allegations of inflated prices paid for trees planted in the park too. And an initial denial that any government funds were used to build the park turned out to be untrue - around $2 million came from state coffers. The army announced its own investigation, and quickly concluded there was no corruption. There was a public outcry, so the Ministry of Defence has ordered another investigation. The police say they cannot investigate unless the military authorises them to do so. A government spokesman told the BBC that independent agencies would soon be allowed to scrutinise the accounts of the project, but could not say when. The government's opponents have jumped on the opportunity to illustrate what they say is hypocrisy on the part of the military in prosecuting former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra for alleged corruption under her administration, yet failing to clean up its own house. Student activists and leaders of the pro-Yingluck ""red shirt"" movement have tried to organise visits to the park, but have been stopped and detained by the army. The government has also charged some of those spreading negative information about the park with sedition, a serious offence which carries a penalty of up to seven years in prison. Few people outside the top ranks of the military can know what lies behind these disturbing developments. But they show that the men who seized power last year, despite their considerable power, have nevertheless been unable to prevent damaging allegations of wrongdoing being made about their own royal promotion projects. Nor have they been able yet to provide a convincing response to those allegations. Many people in Thailand believe the revelations indicate divisions at the top over how to handle the royal succession, and crucially, who has control over this historic transition.

input: By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter But that's about to change with the launch of Animals With Cameras - BBC One's latest nature documentary, which begins on Thursday. For the three-part series, cameras were strapped to animals so scientists (and viewers) could monitor where they go and what they do. And the results are fascinating. ""The technology is finally there to do it,"" series producer Dan Rees tells BBC News. ""Batteries are small enough. Lenses are small enough. You can get small enough sensors to give you a high definition image which can produce slow motion video. ""You can get [the cameras] onto an animal at the size it's comfortable for the animal to wear, that won't affect their behaviour."" Rees says the main benefit of such equipment is that it lets audiences into territory they won't have seen before. ""We can't go down into burrows, high into the air, deep under the sea - so it's a lot to do with access,"" he says. BBC producers offered to share technology and footage with scientists who were already studying a particular species. In most cases, the cameras were fitted by scientists who were already used to handling those animals. But a few animals had to be sedated in order to attach the cameras. ""Animal welfare was extremely important for us,"" Rees says. ""The last thing we want to do is cause them distress. To follow an animal in the first place, there had to be a clear benefit in terms of knowledge about it that might be useful to protecting a species in the future. ""The scientists had to be comfortable that disruption was kept to a minimum."" Last year, Tom McDonald, head of commissioning at the BBC's Natural History unit, singled out the meerkats as one of the series highlights, joking: ""That's my innovation for 2018, more meerkats."" They are, indeed, the focus of the first episode. ""They're just enduringly popular,"" laughs Rees. ""Those car insurance adverts proved to be great PR for meerkats. ""They're a film-maker's dream, because they've got so much personality. They're photogenic, and they spend a lot of time vertical, standing up, which makes quite a big difference - they just feel very human as a consequence."" Presumably, one issue while shooting a programme like this is the potential for expensive equipment to be damaged by the animals on their travels. ""Yes, that was a risk,"" Rees admits. ""And some cameras we didn't get back. ""Things like the meerkats, cheetahs and chimps, the habituated animals, the scientists are interacting with them every day so you know the cameras are going to come back."" Habituated species are generally used to human presence and have normally already been monitored in a fixed territory for some time. ""Having said that, at least one of the meerkat cameras fell off in the burrow, so it'll just stay down there, which won't cause any problems or anything, but sadly there's no way of recovering that footage - the cameras are too small to fit in a transmitter,"" Rees says. ""So with habituated animals it's not really a problem, but with totally wild ones, it is. We fortunately didn't lose any of the underwater ones, which is remarkable really. The penguins and seals come back ashore, so as long as the camera stays on, you can get it back."" In recent weeks we've seen nature documentaries influence public opinion on certain issues, and in some cases even government policy - with one episode of Blue Planet II drawing attention to the detrimental impact of plastic waste on the environment. Speaking to Andrew Marr last month about the success of the plastic bag charge, Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""Nobody who watched Blue Planet will doubt the need for us to do something [about plastic waste]."" Rees's hope is that Animals With Cameras will further raise the audience's awareness of the world around them. ""We [producers] are in the business in the first place because we love animals,"" he says. ""And one of the things we hope will come out of these documentaries is we'll inspire people to care about nature on a broad level. ""I just hope it opens people's eyes to how amazing these animals are, and also perhaps makes people aware of how much we still have to learn about even some really popular animals. They still have a lot of mysteries about them."" 3 highlights to watch out for in Animals With Cameras Animals With Cameras begins on BBC One at 20:00 GMT on Thursday, 1 February.

Mr Davies said he was not convinced the Welsh Government would ""have a leg to stand on"" in trying to shape international trade deals after Brexit. Following Donald Trump's comments during last week's trade visit that the NHS would be ""on the table"" in any future trade talks between the UK and the USA, Eluned Morgan said there was ""absolutely no prospect whatsoever of us allowing the Welsh NHS to be part of any negotiation.""

input: Twitter's shares shot up 11.6% in the first hours of trading, but have dropped to just a 5% increase. The jump came after a report that tech investor Marc Andreessen and investment firm Silver Lake Partners were considering a deal with Twitter. Hours later, Fortune reported Silver Lake was not interested in any deal. ""Silver Lake has no interest in acquiring even a slice of Twitter,"" the Fortune report said. Neither story reported any details of the potential deal or the names of the sources, but the speculation was enough to send Twitter's share price bouncing. The social media site has been struggling to boost its profits. The company is looking to appoint two new board members and a new chief marketing officer ahead of its quarterly profit report on 10 February. Shares of Twitter are down more than 60% from their April highs. Twitter has struggled to attract new users, leading investors to question whether it has the staying power and growth potential of rival social media sites.

input: Shadow Welsh Secretary Owen Smith said such an alliance would be ""difficult"". However, earlier former Welsh Secretary Peter Hain suggested Labour could form a coalition if it fails to win an majority at the next general election. Mr Smith, speaking at the Labour conference, said his party was ""gunning to try and win"" a majority. Writing in the Independent on Sunday, Neath MP Mr Hain suggested majority single-party governments may become the exception in a future where coalitions are semi-permanent fixtures. The Liberal Democrats went into coalition with the Conservatives after the 2010 general election when no party won an outright majority. Mr Hain argued that Lib Dem members might reject the leadership who ""hijacked their party and took it into bed with the Tories,"" including Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. ""A new Lib Dem leadership more in tune with the party's traditions will make it much easier for Ed Miliband to strike a deal - assuming, of course, that there are sufficient Lib Dem MPs remaining after a probable battering,"" he wrote. ""In that context, Ed Miliband's vision of Labour holds great attractions for those anxious to establish a government for the progressive, anti-Tory majority that was often denied office in the last century."" He told BBC Radio Wales Labour was ""well-placed to be the biggest party at the next general election"". Mr Hain added: ""Whether we can actually win after a bad defeat last time - win outright - remains to be seen. ""I think it's quite possible, but that depends on the next couple of years of government."" 'Truly awful defeat' Responding to his predecessor's comments at the start of the Labour conference, Mr Smith said: ""It will be difficult, we know that. ""We know that we had the worst defeat since 1918. ""It was a truly awful defeat for Labour and we know that we've got to work very hard to win back peoples' trust in order to give us a chance of winning the next election. ""We're definitely the underdogs in this fight right now but we're doing better than we were last year, we're doing better certainly than we were two years ago and I don't think we really need to start thinking right now - interesting a parlour game though it is - about whether we go into coalition with the Lib Dems or anyone else."" He said a coalition with the Lib Dems would be ""difficult, truthfully, because I think we feel that the Lib Dems have propped up a very right-wing Conservative government"".

input: The prince, whose four-month deployment to the country has just ended, spoke about his role as an Apache co-pilot gunner, and whether he had killed. ""Yeah, so lots of people have. The squadron's been out here. Everyone's fired a certain amount,"" he said. ""If there's people trying to do bad stuff to our guys, then we'll take them out of the game."" Prince Harry left Afghanistan on Monday. News teams were allowed to interview him during his deployment, if they agreed to delay broadcast until he had left the country. As well as discussing his role in Afghanistan, he talked about various other issues, including that he had ""let my family down"" when he was pictured naked in a Las Vegas hotel room last year. He said this was ""probably a classic example of me probably being too much Army and not enough prince."" But he added: ""But at the end of the day I was in a private area and there should have been a certain amount of privacy that one should expect."" He also talked about: On his role in Afghanistan, one journalist said: ""You are the man with the trigger in your hand, and if called upon, you will fire, and presumably you have and you will kill the enemy?"" The prince responded: ""Yeah, so lots of people have. The squadron's been out here. Everyone's fired a certain amount. Probably a little bit more than this time last year, to a certain extent, but that's just the way that its balanced out. Mainly due to weather, well whatever the reasons, I don't know. ""We fire when we have to, take a life to save a life, but essentially we're more of a deterrent than anything else."" He said missions to recover injured troops were a key role. ""Our job out here is to make sure the guys are safe on the ground. ""Now if that means shooting at someone who's shooting at them, then we'll do it."" 'Stuck in Bastion' Prince Harry is the first member of the Royal Family to see active combat since his uncle, the Duke of York, fought in the Falklands War. Captain Wales, as the prince is known in the military, arrived for his second tour as part of the 100-strong 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment, Army Air Corps in September. Within days of arriving, Camp Bastion was attacked by Taliban insurgents. Prince Harry was moved under guard to a secure location during the attack. Prince Harry said: ""Obviously the papers back home were like 'this is all against me'. No-one really knows yet. But either way, this camp is in the middle of Afghanistan and it should be expected to be attacked at any point... and it was on my birthday, so it was a bit of a reality check."" His first tour was cut short in 2008 after 10 weeks because a media blackout was broken. He was removed from Afghanistan in case he became a target. Then he was part of ground forces, calling in air strikes against enemy positions. He was disappointed to be withdrawn, and determined to return to front-line combat. He said: ""My choice would have been back out on the ground with my regiment - that sounds quite spoilt when I'm standing in front of this [helicopter], Â£45 million worth, but hopefully my friends and family back home know exactly what I'm talking about."" Brotherly support He expressed support for his older brother, William, to serve in combat. William currently flies search and rescue missions from RAF Valley on Anglesey. ""Obviously he'd love to be out here and I don't see why to be honest with you, I don't see why he couldn't.... no-one knows he's in the cockpit."" He added: ""Yes, he'd get shot at but, you know, if the guys who are doing the same job as us are being shot at on the ground, I don't think there's anything wrong with us being shot at as well. ""People back home have issues with that, but we're not special - the guys out there are. Simple as that."" He also described how he juggled his different roles in life. ""You've got to be able to flick the switch all the time. ""I think I said a while back there's three 'me's, as it were. One in the army, one socially - my own private time - and one sort of with the family and stuff like that. ""So, you know, there is a switch and I flick it when necessary. And I like to think it's measured and balanced... Army comes first - it is my work at the end of the day.""

input: It is thought to be the first large-scale attack on Apple's App Store. The hackers created a counterfeit version of Apple's software for building iOS apps, which they persuaded developers to download. Apps compiled using the tool allow the attackers to steal data about users and send it to servers they control. Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks - which has analysed the malware dubbed XcodeGhost - said the perpetrators would also be able to send fake alerts to infected devices to trick their owners into revealing information. It added they could also read and alter information in compromised devices' clipboards, which would potentially allow them to see logins copied to and from password management tools. Infected applications includes Tencent's hugely popular WeChat app, NetEase's music downloading app and Didi Kuaidi's Uber-like car hailing app. Some of the affected apps - including the business card scanner CamCard - are also available outside China. ""We've removed the apps from the App Store that we know have been created with this counterfeit software,"" said Apple spokeswoman Christine Monaghan. ""We are working with the developers to make sure they're using the proper version of Xcode to rebuild their apps,"" said Christine Monaghan. On its official WeChat blog, Tencent said the security issue affected an older version of its app - WeChat 6.2.5 - and that newer versions were not affected. It added that an initial investigation showed that no data theft or leakage of user information had occurred. Analysis: Dave Lee, North America technology reporter In Apple's walled garden App Store, this sort of thing shouldn't happen. The company goes to great lengths, and great expense, to sift through each and every submission to the store. Staff check for quality, usability and, above all else, security. The Apple App Store is generally considered a safe haven as the barrier to entry is high - there's only been a handful of instances of malware found on iOS apps, compared to Google's Play store which for a while was regarded as something of a ""Wild West"" for apps (until they introduced their own malware-scanning system too). It makes this attack all the more surprising, as it looks like two groups of supposedly informed people have been caught out. Firstly developers, who security researchers say were duped into using counterfeit software to build their apps, creating the right conditions for the malware to be applied. And secondly, Apple's quality testers, who generally do a very good job in keeping out nasties, but in this case couldn't detect the threat. Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Developers targeted The malware was initially flagged by researchers at the Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba. It discovered that the hackers had uploaded several altered versions of Xcode - a tool used to build iOS apps - to a Chinese cloud storage service. Then, about six months ago, the attackers posted links to the software on several forums commonly visited by Chinese developers. ""In China - and in other places around the world - sometimes network speeds are very slow when downloading large files from Apple's servers,"" explained Palo Alto Networks in a follow-up blog. ""As the standard Xcode installer is nearly three gigabytes, some Chinese developers choose to download the package from other sources."" It added that potentially hundreds of millions of users might have been affected. Apple does have a security tool - called Gatekeeper - that is designed to alert users to unauthorised Mac programs and stop them from being run. However, it appears the developers must disabled the facility, allowing them to create iOS apps with XcodeGhost. Sense of security Despite the many news headlines about the breach, one expert said he did not forecast a major impact on the sale of Apple products. ""It is definitely embarrassing for Apple but the reality is that malware is a persistent problem since the days of PCs and the problem will multiply as the number of mobile devices explodes from 1.4 billion units in 2015 to 1.8 billion in 2020,"" Wee Teck Loo, head of consumer electronics at market research firm Euromonitor International, told the BBC. In fact, consumers are less cautious on mobile devices than on PCs, he added. ""In emerging markets like China or Vietnam, mobile devices are their first connected product and security is taken for granted,"" he said. ""Consumers in emerging markets are also less protective of privacy and security issues."" Earlier this month, login names and passwords for more than 225,000 Apple accounts were stolen by cyber-thieves in China. It was uncovered by security firm Palo Alto Networks while investigating suspicious activity on many Apple devices. It found a malicious software family that targets jailbroken iPhones. The majority of people affected were in China.

input: By Mark DevenportBBC News NI Political Editor The Loyalist Communities Council (LCC) was launched in 2015. In a statement, it said that ""any unionist who votes for the Alliance Party is driving a nail into the coffin of the union"". The Alliance Party has strongly rebuked the LCC position, calling the statement ""absurd"". The loyalist community council has the backing of the Ulster Defence Association, the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Red Hand Commando. The LCC also said no party has done ""more to undermine the Britishness of Northern Ireland, and foment community mistrust and division than the Alliance Party"". It called for a maximum turnout by unionist voters and endorsed four specific candidates. They are Ulster Unionist Tom Elliott in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, the DUP's Nigel Dodds in North Belfast, the DUP's Gavin Robinson in East Belfast and the DUP's Emma Little Pengelly in South Belfast. In the first two constituencies, the candidates mentioned are the only unionists running, but in the other two seats the DUP faces competition from the Ulster Unionists. Alliance 'satisfied' In a statement, the Alliance Party said: ""In sharp contrast to the DUP, who appear content to accept the endorsement of paramilitaries, Alliance is satisfied to accept their rejection of our principled and consistent stand for the rule of law and against all terrorism. ""This absurd statement shows not only the dearth of political analysis within loyalist paramilitaries at this time, but highlights clearly which parties are really willing to take on and challenge paramilitaries, and which are happier to chase and foster their support."" In Monday night's UTV election debate, both Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill and Alliance's Naomi Long challenged the DUP's Nigel Dodds to reject the endorsement of a group linked to loyalist paramilitaries. Mr Dodds replied that his party had always opposed paramilitarism. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme on Tuesday, the DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said: ""I do not seek, nor does the DUP seek the support or endorsement of any paramilitary organisation, and we reject any such endorsement."" The Ulster Unionist Party leader, Robin Swann, said: ""The Ulster Unionist Party is a party of law and order. ""We have not asked for the support of paramilitary organisations nor do we want the backing of organisations still engaged in paramilitary or criminal activity."" On social media, former Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt has clarified that he has not asked for and does not accept the LCC's statement of support. Mr Nesbitt was not one of the candidates mentioned in the group's election statement. Tony Blair's former chief of staff Jonathan Powell played a part in setting up the LCC. Mr Powell described the formation of the council as the ""last best chance"" to include loyalists left behind by the peace process.

input: By Graham FraserBBC Scotland These women come together on the first Monday of every month for the Feel Good Project, an award-winning community initiative at the Lady J's Unisex Hair Salon. Lady J is Jill Lauder. Her salon is adorned with pictures of Elvis Presley, her favourite star, and among all the products you would expect to find in a hairdressing salon is a silver engraved plate. It was awarded to Jill by CVS Falkirk when they named her as their volunteer of the year. At the back of the salon, in an area usually reserved for the washing and drying of hair, an urn of tea has been set up for the day next to some cakes, biscuits and three large boxes of wigs. ""I started the project because I had lost two good friends at one time,"" said Jill. ""I used to do their wigs, and pamper them. Once they were gone, I felt I had nothing to do."" Jill spoke with one her customers, Sandra Campbell. Sandra is the nurse consultant for cancer and palliative care with NHS Forth Valley, and Jill came up with the idea for the Feel Good Project at her salon after speaking with her. The Macmillan one to one team from NHS Forth Valley provide support to Jill's project. This team supports people with cancer and works with many other groups both inside and outside of the NHS. Sandra is in the salon this Monday, chatting with various women and offering advice. ""The people within the NHS do the very best they can, but what we need is to be able to work with partners as well,"" she said. ""We need to all work together and that is all charities, big, small, and projects like this. ""It is the supportive atmosphere you feel in here which is really good. ""What the team here do is all from kindness - they give up their time, and the premises. Not everyone is able to do that. But if people are willing and able to partner up with someone within the NHS for that bit of support then it is a fantastic way to go."" The Cancer Journey Sharon McFeat, 47, has been coming along to the Feel Good project for four years after seeing a post about the initiative on social media. She was diagnosed four years ago with a sarcoma cancer in her leg. Two years ago, it spread to other parts of her body. She is now fundraising for another type of treatment not available on the NHS. ""Somewhere like here has been really supportive, because it is not a hospital environment for once, and you can just speak to other people who may not have the same cancer as you, but are going through similar types and totally understand how you feel. ""There have been people who used to come here who are not here anymore, who we became close to. That is just part and parcel of the cancer journey."" Everyone working in the salon on the Feel Good Project is a volunteer. Jill provides and fits wigs and cuts hair, while Jayne applies nail polish and gives hand massages. Mo, who works as a make-up consultant with Boots, helps the women with their make-up and eyebrows. Other volunteers make soup, cakes, and bring tablet along for everyone to enjoy. Everything is free. Sixty-year-old Karen MacLennan, from Grangemouth, is another woman who is benefitting from the salon. She has known Jill for years, and started coming to the cancer project after discovering a lump on her breast almost three years ago. Karen has been in surgery three times, and has had chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She will take drugs for the next decade as part of her treatment. ""It's fabulous, because we all get together and we are all in the same position with cancer. Many different kinds of cancer, and different places. ""It is a great social time, and we can be very practical talking about side effects. ""The girls - Jill, and all her volunteers are fantastic. You can relax, and have a laugh, and enjoy your afternoon."" This project is clearly having a positive impact on the lives of women with cancer in Grangemouth, but Jill sees no reason why projects like this can't be started in communities across the UK and beyond. She added: ""Nearly every salon is shut on a Monday. Wouldn't it be lovely if we could just open one up for a few hours, and we had one every week? ""It is really easy to set up, it is fantastic to do and you are helping in your community.""

""They surround us now, they're on the Brittany coast, they're on the Normandy coast - we will get them"", he said. A nest of Asian Hornets found in Alderney in July was destroyed as a precaution against them spreading, the Alderney government said. In Jersey, an amateur insect expert who photographed it at Mount Bingham, Jersey's environment department said. The department said the area had been searched and no further hornet activity detected. Dismember bees People who suspect they have found a hornet should send a photograph to the department if it is safe to do so, a spokesman said. Mr Hogge said the Asian Hornet dismembered honey bees to take back to feed their young and could wipe out entire hives. ""They've got a particularly unpleasant sting, and they are aggressive. If one attacks you and leaves a sting it will leave a scent and others will come and attack you too,"" he added. However, the department stressed the Asian hornet was no more harmful to humans than the European hornet. Identifying an Asian hornet Source: National Bee Unit

input: Catholics were encouraged to go to designated points along the country's borders for a mass rosary prayer for the salvation of Poland and the world. Church leaders say the event is purely religious, but there are concerns it could be seen as endorsing the state's refusal to let in Muslim migrants. The feast day marks the anniversary of a Christian victory over Ottoman Turks at the sea battle of Lepanto in 1571. People were bussed in from more than 300 churches to points all along the border. They stood in lines, some on beaches on the Baltic Sea, some in fields and some in towns. ""We come to the border of Poland to pray for the Poles and for the whole world,"" said one woman. ""We want our Catholic faith to continue, to keep our children safe, that our brothers from other countries can understand that our faith is unwavering and that we feel safer, not only in Poland but also in the world."" Mateusz Maranowski, a Polish radio journalist, said he had come out to thank the Virgin Mary for his child, who was born prematurely. He said about 300 people took part in the event in the sea port of Gdynia. ""At first I wanted to pray alone on the beach but it turned out that many people from nearby parishes came out to the beach to take part in the... event,"" he said. 'Encompass the world' Halina Kotarska, 65, said she was expressing thanks for the survival of her son in a car crash, but also praying for the survival of Christianity in Europe. ""Islam wants to destroy Europe,"" she said, quoted by the Associated Press. ""They want to turn us away from Christianity."" Some priests and Church commentators said the event could be seen as support for the government's refusal to accept Muslim migrants, a policy backed by a majority of Poles. Organisers said the prayer was not directed against anyone or anything. The border was chosen, they said, because it symbolised their desire to encompass the world with prayer. Poland, along with Hungary and the Czech Republic, refused to take part in an EU deal in 2015 to relocate refugees from frontline states Italy and Greece. The Polish position has put it at odds with the Vatican, with Pope Francis urging greater acceptance of migrants on a visit to Poland last year. Bishops have urged the government to assist selected Syrian refugees but the plan has failed to secure politicians' backing.
