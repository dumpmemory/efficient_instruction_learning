input: Abstract: Based on our preliminary studies and the results of this study, we conclude that argon laser welding of 4-8 mm internal diameter veins, arteries, and arteriovenous fistulas may have several potential advantages compared to conventional suture techniques. The benefits of laser repairs may include improved mechanical properties, and absence of the foreign body response related to sutures. Laser welding is sterile, nontactile and possibly time conserving, and the wounds heal rapidly without aneurysms or excess tissue proliferation.

input: Abstract: The System 7 pump/actuator/engine combination has demonstrated biologic compatibility and physiologic effectiveness and responsiveness in five TVAS in vivo studies. The recent 75-day implant supports the feasibility of extended reliability of the system components. Postoperative system maintenance was necessary only because of the nonhermetic design of System 7. However, the ability to pump 11 l/min at 120 beats/min, synchronize at beat rates of 144 beats/min, and pump against mean arterial pressures of more than 150 mmHg while maintaining hematologic and biochemical values within physiologic range sets a very optimistic stage for System 8 hardware. A System 8 concept is shown in Figure 14. The System 8 hardware will include a thermal salt package capable of providing completely untethered circulatory support for a nominal 8-h period. Recharge will be accomplished with a transcutaneous transformer in 1 h. Thermal management problems become minimal, with an average energy input of 15.8 W (peak of 24.9 W). The human preclinical testing of System 8 will start in 1988.

input: Abstract: The roller screw electric VAD is easier to manufacture and 25% lighter than the previously described drum cam model. This device requires 12 to 15 W to pump 6 to 8 l/min with minimal hemolysis. The motor drive has functioned for periods up to 93 days in vivo with no measurable wear. The compliance chamber volume varies by 100 cc during VAD function but does so while maintaining pressure variations below 15 mmHg. Compliance chamber volume loss of 2 to 5 cc/day is explained by gas transport through SPU. The subcutaneous sampling port provides ready access to the sealed system.

input: Abstract: In order to perform quantitative in vitro and clinical studies on the removal of Al by the combined therapy of DFO administration and HD, an HPLC system for measuring DFO was established and a leaky membrane with enhanced permeability to middle molecular substances was developed. The DFO infusion caused rises in plasma Al levels (regarded as indicating the elution of accumulated Al) in patients undergoing HD. Plasma levels increased most in long-term patients and those with bone pain. Examination of Al clearances demonstrated that this increased plasma Al content passed through HD membranes at levels of more than 80 micrograms/l, and that the leaky membrane was more effective for removal of Al as well as DFO than the conventional one. Although a 1:1 complex between DFO and Al in an aqueous solution was confirmed, the formation of Al-rich complexes in vivo was suggested. It is concluded that Al-DFO complex formed in vivo can be effectively removed across the leaky membrane.

input: Abstract: With 111In-labeled platelets and 125I-labeled bovine fibrinogen, regional mapping of platelet and fibrinogen deposition on leaflets and sewing rings was obtained. Ten Holstein calves received 25-mm mitral valves (ISLM) and were killed 1, 14, and 30 days after implantation. Twenty-four hours before the calves were killed, 350 to 450 microCi of 111In-labeled platelets and 200 to 250 microCi of 125I-labeled bovine fibrinogen were administered intravenously. The components of the tissue valves, i.e., three leaflets and sewing rings, were separated. Each leaflet was cut into four sections: free edge, central zone, flexion zone, and attachment zone. From the radioactivity in blood, leaflet zones, sewing rings, area of leaflet zones, platelet count, and fibrinogen level in blood, the mean regional density of adherent platelets, fibrinogen-fibrin, and fibrinogen/platelet were calculated. The density of platelets and fibrinogen deposited on the components of the valves decreases with time postimplantation. The number of fibrinogen molecules per platelet is fivefold to 20-fold higher than that of the receptor concentration on platelets on leaflet zones, suggesting the heterogeneity of fibrinogen-fibrin in thrombus and components of the valve.

This finding contrasts with the results of currently available prostheses, including autologous vein, which rapidly become minimally compliant. We conclude that this vascular construction is stable over the long-term following implantation and may improve the success of small internal diameter arterial reconstruction by eliminating failures caused by intimal hyperplasia.

No patient developed postoperative jaundice. Sixty-nine children were exposed to two halothane anaesthetics within 28 days on 149 occasions and serial estimations of serum liver enzyme concentrations were obtained. Minor increases in the concentrations of serum AST and ALT were recorded in 10.6% and 4.7% of patient entries, respectively. Postoperative GGT and SAP concentrations were increased in 2.7% of patient entries. Patients in whom enzyme values were increased before the first anaesthetic were no more likely than other subjects to develop further changes.

input: Abstract: The effects of atracurium and alcuronium on the evoked mechanical and electromyographic responses of the adductor pollicis were investigated in 30 adult patients. The ulnar nerve was stimulated with trains of four supramaximal pulses of 0.2 ms duration and a frequency of 2 Hz at intervals of 20 s. The mechanical response was measured using a strain gauge force transducer and the evoked compound action potential (ECAP) was recorded simultaneously using a Medelec MS91 electromyography system. Depression of the electromyographic and mechanical responses, caused by atracurium, was similar during onset and antagonism of blockade. During onset of blockade by alcuronium, the mechanical response was depressed to a significantly greater extent compared with the ECAP. This difference was not observed during antagonism with neostigmine. The rates of onset of atracurium and alcuronium were generally similar, but the rate of onset of mechanical fade was greater in the alcuronium group. There was no significant quantitative difference between the rates of antagonism of alcuronium and atracurium when assessed by the mechanical first response ratio. Electromyographic first response and electromyographic and mechanical train-of-four ratios recovered more rapidly in the atracurium group. These findings suggest that the differences between mechanical and electromyographic measurements of neuromuscular blockade are drug-specific and are more pronounced during the onset of blockade than during its antagonism by neostigmine.

The antagonists were administered 5 min after total ablation of the twitch response and the end-point of recovery was a train-of-four ratio of 70%. In 30 patients given vecuronium the mean time to reach this point (duration TOF70) was 66.7 min in the control group (no antagonist), 43.5 min in the group given neostigmine and 59.8 min in the group given edrophonium. The duration TOF70 was shorter in the neostigmine group than in the control (P less than 0.01) and edrophonium (P less than 0.01) groups. The duration TOF70 did not differ from control in the edrophonium group. In 29 patients given atracurium, the durations TOF70 were 66.4, 44.1 and 54.9 min in the control, neostigmine and edrophonium groups, respectively. The durations TOF70 in the neostigmine (P less than 0.01) and edrophonium (P less than 0.01), groups were shorter than control. The duration TOF70 of the neostigmine group was shorter than in the edrophonium group (P less than 0.01). These results show that profound neuromuscular blockade cannot be rapidly antagonized by either of these two agents, but if reversal is required under these circumstances, neostigmine would be the more effective drug.

input: Abstract: Antagonism of atracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade by neostigmine or edrophonium has been studied using the tetanic (50 Hz) and train-of-four (2 Hz) or single twitch responses of the adductor pollicis muscle in 22 anaesthetized patients. A further nine patients not given an anticholinesterase acted as a control group. In two groups (six patients for each anticholinesterase) in whom antagonism was attempted at 95-98% blockade of the tetanic response, recovery of the tetanic response after two or three doses of edrophonium 0.75 mg kg-1 i.v. was not statistically different from that in the control group; recovery after two doses of neostigmine 2.5 mg i.v. was significantly faster (P less than 0.001). Recovery of the single twitch response after antagonism with edrophonium, although longer than that with neostigmine (P less than 0.01), was significantly shorter than in the control group (P less than 0.05). When edrophonium is given at the commencement of recovery, the initial rapid antagonism of tetanic block is not sustained, whereas antagonism by neostigmine is more persistent and the recovery phase is significantly shortened. In a further two groups of patients (n = 5) given atracurium 0.3 mg kg-1 i.v., antagonism was not attempted until the peak height of the tetanic contraction had reached approximately 50% of the control value.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
